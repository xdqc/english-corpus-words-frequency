

4
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,191
Burn them all! Where's my sister?

5
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,871
Burn them all!

6
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,480
Please.

7
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:41,768
Burn them. Burn them all!

8
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,137
Burn them all!

9
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:07,742
Meera.

10
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:11,280
They found us.

11
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:20,533
I'm so sorry.

12
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:27,600
Come with me, now.

13
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:34,142
The dead don't rest.

14
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,484
It's so green. Oh, yes.

15
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:08,355
Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over.

16
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:12,773
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

17
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,688
The odd willow.

18
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:23,448
And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.

19
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,222
Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.

20
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:33,804
You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.

21
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,608
That's not any better being a nervous mute.

22
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:45,804
I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title

23
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:50,106
and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't.

24
00:06:52,017 --> 00:06:54,666
A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.

25
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:59,510
And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family.

26
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:03,671
So you know what to tell them.

27
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:07,511
That Little Sam is your baby. Yes, now that's very important.

28
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,951
If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in.

29
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:15,448
He'll get an education. He'll learn to read.

30
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:18,577
And you can help teach him. Huh?

31
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:21,342
What did you tell your family about me?

32
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:29,520
I told them I met you in the North. Did you tell them how far north?

33
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,488
Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.

34
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:36,293
You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

35
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:37,413
The thing is...

36
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,720
my father doesn't like wildlings.

37
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,315
He hoped I'd make a man of myself by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

38
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,995
so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.

39
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:54,044
I think we're here.

40
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:27,351
Sam. Oh, Sam.

41
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,986
Oh, hello, Mother.

42
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,284
I never thought I'd see you again.

43
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:35,902
- You look wonderful. - Oh.

44
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:44,017
Talla? Gods, you're a woman now.

45
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:46,577
Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.

46
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,608
- He has yellow teeth-- - That's enough, Talla.

47
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.

48
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,422
Oh, my.

49
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,648
You are lovely.

50
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:07,422
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

51
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:13,093
Oh, and this,

52
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:16,231
this is our son Samwell.

53
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,986
Hello, little one.

54
00:09:24,684 --> 00:09:27,164
It's me, your grandmother.

55
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:33,022
May I hold him? Yes, of course.

56
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,244
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

57
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:44,817
You'll be a scholar like your father.

58
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:48,604
Where is Father? And Dickon?

59
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:50,737
They're on a hunt.

60
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:52,977
They'll join us for dinner.

61
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:57,253
Come inside. Such a journey.

62
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:02,764
You must be exhausted. Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel.

63
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,186
Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine.

64
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,986
What's your color? Midnight blue or silver?

65
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,217
Silver, maybe. Come.

66
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:15,840
You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.

67
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,311
Is there no other way?

68
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:31,288
You're afraid for her? Of course I'm afraid for her!

69
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:37,831
It just seems very dangerous.

70
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:40,130
She'll be protected the entire way.

71
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:45,466
The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds.

72
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,191
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

73
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:56,266
I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf.

74
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,004
She's truly opened her heart to them.

75
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:03,377
She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.

76
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:06,053
And now she's devoted to the gods as well.

77
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,177
Would you like to see her?

78
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:35,413
Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?

79
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,320
- No, Your Grace. - I've missed you.

80
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,426
More than you could know.

81
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:45,413
We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.

82
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:46,951
Better how?

83
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,480
Soon the--

84
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,840
walk of atonement.

85
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,026
He says there's no other way.

86
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,893
Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?

87
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,915
Yes, a few times.

88
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,328
Have you? Yes, I have.

89
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,950
He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?

90
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:13,440
You think I'm mad.

91
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,675
I sound mad.

92
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,680
No. No, you don't.

93
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,644
You-- you could never.

94
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:22,817
You're right, he's not. He's a lot more--

95
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:26,970
He is. There's something about him.

96
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,140
His way of looking at the world.

97
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:36,168
It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.

98
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:40,560
It's taken me a while. He's helped me.

99
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:43,475
What are you talking about?

100
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:47,653
You're a good person. You've always been a good person.

101
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,888
You're the best person I know.

102
00:12:51,128 --> 00:12:53,680
I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.

103
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,182
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.

104
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,404
I never gave them what they really needed, though.

105
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:09,146
I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.

106
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:15,662
All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did.

107
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:19,982
There were so many lies in those stories.

108
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,128
I don't understand.

109
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:25,260
It's all right. It really is.

110
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:29,120
It's such a relief to let go of those lies.

111
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,484
What about Loras?

112
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:39,662
I love my brother.

113
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:42,080
I will always love my brother.

114
00:13:43,964 --> 00:13:47,768
His soul is pure and perfect.

115
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:52,293
His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it.

116
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:57,137
He just needs to atone for them.

117
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,791
We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another.

118
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:07,048
The gods have a plan for us all.

119
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:25,155
It's hard to walk in this.

120
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:29,155
It's beautiful.

121
00:14:31,786 --> 00:14:33,070
You're beautiful.

122
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,120
This venison, it's very tasty.

123
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,933
Is it from today's hunt? Well, no.

124
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:32,560
We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's.

125
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,213
Oh, of course. Sorry.

126
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:41,182
Long journey. Brought it down from 70 yards.

127
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:46,408
One shot. Oh, that's a fair distance.

128
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,520
So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?

129
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,204
Oh, yes. Yes.

130
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:53,946
A good amount.

131
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,800
North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat.

132
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:02,480
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

133
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:05,173
Rabbits.

134
00:16:06,622 --> 00:16:08,293
Sometimes squirrels.

135
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:15,422
I say "we," it's my friend Jon mostly.

136
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:19,413
Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly.

137
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,320
She's-- she's quite a good hunter as well.

138
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:24,755
Um, huntress.

139
00:16:26,062 --> 00:16:27,902
I imagine it's common where you're from.

140
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:31,840
We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

141
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,266
who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.

142
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:38,942
Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us.

143
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:42,293
I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.

144
00:16:42,595 --> 00:16:43,724
That's enough of that.

145
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,004
Samwell, would you care for more bread?

146
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:51,893
Oh, yes. Yes, please.

147
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:52,897
Thank you, Mother.

148
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,573
Not fat enough already?

149
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:14,720
I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.

150
00:17:15,022 --> 00:17:16,760
- He wants me to-- - I read your letter.

151
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,044
You're to be a maester. Yes.

152
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:26,657
And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black.

153
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:29,795
I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.

154
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:33,706
Something resembling a man at least.

155
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:38,720
You managed to stay soft and fat.

156
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:43,404
Your nose buried in books.

157
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:47,706
Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.

158
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,502
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.

159
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:54,524
Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.

160
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,408
He can wield a sword.

161
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:00,248
He killed a Thenn.

162
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:07,475
He killed a white walker. There's no such thing.

163
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,666
I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.

164
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:16,053
He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.

165
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:19,448
He risked his own life to save mine more than once.

166
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:22,622
He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.

167
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,470
Your way down to Castle Black?

168
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,768
Where did he kill a white walker?

169
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:37,937
Where are you from?

170
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,293
How'd you come to meet my son?

171
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,715
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

172
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:47,431
- Where? - Gilly.

173
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,608
- North of the Wall. - North of the Wall?

174
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:55,982
You're a wildling.

175
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,582
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries

176
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:14,346
and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son.

177
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,444
See that sword?

178
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,622
It's called Heartsbane.

179
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:27,297
It's been in our family for 500 years.

180
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:32,737
It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world.

181
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:38,044
It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him.

182
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:42,782
He will never wield that sword.

183
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:49,306
If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house.

184
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:56,968
I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that.

185
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:58,408
Who else would have him?

186
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:02,275
But I overestimated him.

187
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,764
No.

188
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:11,340
It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.

189
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:15,610
This you getting back at me, boy?

190
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:22,053
Hmm? Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?

191
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,004
And you got what you were after, didn't you?

192
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:31,315
A bastard. A half-breed bastard.

193
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:34,355
Your invitation into our home.

194
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,244
Come, my dear. Talla.

195
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:42,195
I've lost my appetite. He dishonors us.

196
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:44,097
You dishonor yourself.

197
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:52,560
Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her.

198
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:58,844
To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens.

199
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:02,480
The bastard will be raised here.

200
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:08,808
But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.

201
00:21:16,764 --> 00:21:18,862
I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.

202
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:22,791
I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.

203
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm not angry at you.

204
00:21:26,764 --> 00:21:31,191
I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it.

205
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:38,275
When do you have to go?

206
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:42,622
First light.

207
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,151
Say good-bye to him for me.

208
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:06,817
You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.

209
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,360
He doesn't know what you are.

210
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,586
Good-bye, Gilly.

211
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:01,493
- Sam? - We're leaving.

212
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,804
- What? - Get your things.

213
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:06,213
I don't have any things.

214
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:09,120
- What are you doing? - We belong together.

215
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:14,106
All of us. What about your mother and sister?

216
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:17,822
Oh, they'll understand. Your sister's dress.

217
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,386
She won't mind.

218
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,546
Looks better on you anyway. Sam.

219
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,231
That's your father's sword.

220
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,231
It's my family's sword.

221
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:38,017
Sam. Won't he come for it?

222
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,408
He can bloody well try.

223
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:51,715
The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.

224
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,533
And to you, my beauteous bride, I pledge undying love.

225
00:23:56,853 --> 00:24:00,862
Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.

226
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:05,644
I'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer.

227
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:10,293
Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?

228
00:24:10,293 --> 00:24:15,306
Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.

229
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:20,373
The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.

230
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,271
Poison!

231
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:35,226
Murder!

232
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:38,524
I gasp. I-- I die.

233
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:41,288
I limp.

234
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,617
And it was he...

235
00:24:46,888 --> 00:24:48,450
...that poisoned me.

236
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:51,493
My evil Uncle Imp.

237
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:59,260
Calm down, dear.

238
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:05,493
My firstborn son.

239
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:10,844
My golden lion foully, falsely slain.

240
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:17,653
I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.

241
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:23,920
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead.

242
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:27,804
For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead.

243
00:25:31,244 --> 00:25:32,480
Oh, grief.

244
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:38,053
Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow.

245
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,480
All hope is lost.

246
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,991
All joy is gone.

247
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:51,386
And there is no tomorrow.

248
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,764
What is that I hear and smell?

249
00:26:14,826 --> 00:26:17,537
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

250
00:26:17,671 --> 00:26:24,124
It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

251
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:28,275
You beast. You beast.

252
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:32,850
You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.

253
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:36,248
No worse child ever stained this land.

254
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:38,444
Curse the day I named you.

255
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:51,866
My greatest crime. Now I must flee.

256
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:58,540
Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.

257
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:02,800
Don't fear winter. Fear me!

258
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:07,706
Thank you.

259
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,071
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo.

260
00:27:14,071 --> 00:27:16,746
I give you Bobono.

261
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:20,200
I give you Camello.

262
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,208
And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.

263
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,964
Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.

264
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:42,275
That crowd was shit.

265
00:27:46,808 --> 00:27:47,640
Girl.

266
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:50,151
What are you doing back here?

267
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:56,106
Nothing. I saw you the other day in the audience.

268
00:27:56,186 --> 00:27:58,577
How many times have you seen this stupid play?

269
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,204
Three times.

270
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,626
Did you pay? No.

271
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,168
I remember when the players came to my village.

272
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,400
I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.

273
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:15,706
Just like you.

274
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:20,622
Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs,

275
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:24,017
cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.

276
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,920
I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.

277
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:33,360
You're very good. My final speech is shit.

278
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:37,608
But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.

279
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:39,884
So change it.

280
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:44,942
It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.

281
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:47,893
How would you change it?

282
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:56,800
The queen loves her son more than anything.

283
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:00,480
And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye.

284
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,400
She wouldn't just cry.

285
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:07,680
She would be angry.

286
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:11,502
She would want to kill the person who did this to her.

287
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,013
What's your name?

288
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:19,964
Mercy.

289
00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:23,955
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

290
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:26,551
Wonderful eyebrows.

291
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,351
Do you like pretending to be other people?

292
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:33,830
I have to go. My father's waiting for me.

293
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:44,675
Lady Crane, they loved you.

294
00:29:45,262 --> 00:29:47,840
They were sweet. Or drunk.

295
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:50,044
Drunkenly sweet.

296
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:55,386
No laugh for Ned's death. These people are worse than animals.

297
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:59,617
But they loved her. They all love her.

298
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:03,235
Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.

299
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:07,475
I do what I can with what I'm given. With what you're given?

300
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,768
Well, I was thinking-- Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?

301
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:14,337
Full to the tits with ideas.

302
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:19,380
- I didn't mean-- - You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas.

303
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,915
Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life?

304
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,168
Who is anyone to judge my work?

305
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:30,462
This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.

306
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,137
You have no right to an opinion.

307
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:47,848
Careful of that one.

308
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:54,250
She wants you dead.

309
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:37,155
And? As I expected.

310
00:31:39,395 --> 00:31:43,200
A shame. A girl had many gifts.

311
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,928
You promised me.

312
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:55,715
Don't let her suffer.

313
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:50,666
Company, halt!

314
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,102
My lord. My lord.

315
00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:00,986
My friends, the hour has come.

316
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:05,022
Madness has overtaken this city

317
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:09,360
and grasped in its claws my children.

318
00:33:10,044 --> 00:33:15,840
But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came.

319
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:20,586
Madness has had its day!

320
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,946
Forward, march!

321
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:31,760
Rich or poor, noble or common,

322
00:33:33,217 --> 00:33:36,542
if we sin, we must atone.

323
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:43,280
Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner.

324
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:47,964
She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied.

325
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:51,386
She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.

326
00:33:51,386 --> 00:33:57,546
She disgraced her house, her king, and herself.

327
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:31,075
Company, halt!

328
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:33,100
Face front!

329
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,853
Turn!

330
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,248
Lord Tyrell.

331
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,724
Ser Jaime.

332
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:44,346
Sorry to interrupt.

333
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:47,004
We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.

334
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:49,715
Give them to us and we'll be on our way.

335
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:54,071
I don't have the authority to give them to you.

336
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:57,386
And you don't have the authority to take them.

337
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:58,853
That's right.

338
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,968
Hyah.

339
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:09,671
Lock spears!

340
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:15,564
I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.

341
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,102
The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.

342
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:23,582
You've already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice.

343
00:35:23,893 --> 00:35:28,568
Every last sparrow will die before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.

344
00:35:29,271 --> 00:35:33,191
To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us.

345
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:34,853
We yearn for it.

346
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:46,933
But there is no call for it today.

347
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:53,048
There will be no walk of atonement.

348
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:11,040
Order up.

349
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:14,933
Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins

350
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:19,840
by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.

351
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:55,493
Together we announce a new age of harmony.

352
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,831
A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.

353
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:21,484
Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!

354
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:27,893
The Crown and the Faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests.

355
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:33,004
Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

356
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:53,400
What's happening?

357
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:57,470
He's beaten us. That's what's happening.

358
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:16,071
When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.

359
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:21,093
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

360
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:25,128
I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.

361
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,204
You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.

362
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:36,986
I have to answer to the gods. Not when you're sitting in that chair.

363
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:43,653
The Crown's decision on this matter is final.

364
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,320
Will I be walking naked in the streets?

365
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:53,420
Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?

366
00:38:58,115 --> 00:39:01,930
You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.

367
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,240
And you will continue to do so.

368
00:39:06,435 --> 00:39:08,044
But not in this city.

369
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,577
You've lost it?

370
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,857
Yes, Father.

371
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:20,844
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

372
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:23,608
Presumably you still know where it is.

373
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:28,551
You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.

374
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:31,360
He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.

375
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,022
You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.

376
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:38,133
You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.

377
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:41,671
Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him.

378
00:39:42,168 --> 00:39:44,444
That's what it means to lose something.

379
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:47,084
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

380
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,946
I don't think it's fair to blame us--

381
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:53,217
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

382
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:57,235
swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.

383
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:59,662
Not again. Riverrun is ours.

384
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,040
Take it back.

385
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:07,022
We don't have the men. We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.

386
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:10,408
The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.

387
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,493
The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us,

388
00:40:13,493 --> 00:40:15,502
raiding our supply trains and camps.

389
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:18,551
Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.

390
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:22,337
If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.

391
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,964
They're laughing at us.

392
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:29,520
All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us.

393
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:32,071
I hear it in my sleep!

394
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,777
I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.

395
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:40,151
And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.

396
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,311
Take that castle back.

397
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:46,195
He'll never yield, Father.

398
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,084
Oh, he'll yield.

399
00:40:53,813 --> 00:41:00,328
You'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly,

400
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:04,853
and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat.

401
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:10,648
And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.

402
00:41:11,413 --> 00:41:12,560
His nephew.

403
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,302
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

404
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:32,542
You're going home.

405
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,320
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.

406
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:41,431
Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old.

407
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:45,840
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.

408
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,160
Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.

409
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:53,120
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

410
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,235
What, then?

411
00:41:57,831 --> 00:42:01,502
I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen

412
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:04,266
and have him gather the best killers he knows.

413
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,017
I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.

414
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:13,235
- You can't. - He has our son! He stole our son!

415
00:42:14,062 --> 00:42:18,248
He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?

416
00:42:19,484 --> 00:42:21,697
We should treat them without mercy and we will.

417
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:24,968
But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive.

418
00:42:24,968 --> 00:42:27,013
And without you, this is all for nothing.

419
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:33,288
Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you.

420
00:42:34,444 --> 00:42:36,826
Show our men where their loyalties belong.

421
00:42:36,826 --> 00:42:40,862
Show them what Lannisters are, what we do to our enemies.

422
00:42:42,248 --> 00:42:46,924
And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.

423
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:50,026
You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.

424
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:53,226
It will be a trial by combat.

425
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:56,106
I have the Mountain.

426
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,546
They've made us both stronger, all of them.

427
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:05,208
They have no idea how strong we are.

428
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:07,742
No idea what we're going to do to them.

429
00:43:18,275 --> 00:43:20,190
We've always been together.

430
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,711
We'll always be together.

431
00:43:23,422 --> 00:43:25,582
We're the only two people in the world.

432
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:47,333
Why did you help us?

433
00:43:50,702 --> 00:43:53,813
The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me. The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.

434
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:56,008
Now he lives again.

435
00:44:08,648 --> 00:44:11,128
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

436
00:44:12,595 --> 00:44:13,768
A fearless boy.

437
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,008
Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.

438
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,020
Who are you?

439
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:39,280
Uncle Benjen.

440
00:44:41,075 --> 00:44:44,070
The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

441
00:44:47,457 --> 00:44:51,493
I led a ranging party deep into the North to find white walkers.

442
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:58,231
They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.

443
00:45:00,853 --> 00:45:03,546
Left me there to die. To turn.

444
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,382
The Children found me.

445
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:09,831
Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.

446
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:13,653
How? The same way they made the walkers in the first place.

447
00:45:13,653 --> 00:45:14,968
You saw it yourself.

448
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,875
Dragonglass.

449
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:22,328
A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.

450
00:45:24,506 --> 00:45:26,408
You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.

451
00:45:27,555 --> 00:45:30,373
I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.

452
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:37,120
You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.

453
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:40,648
Drink.

454
00:45:43,822 --> 00:45:49,297
One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men.

455
00:45:50,275 --> 00:45:54,151
When he does, you will be there waiting for him.

456
00:45:55,724 --> 00:45:57,084
And you will be ready.

457
00:46:19,164 --> 00:46:20,302
Everything all right?

458
00:46:21,484 --> 00:46:24,853
How many days' ride to Meereen? A week at best.

459
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,670
How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?

460
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,191
Dothraki and all their horses,

461
00:46:31,226 --> 00:46:35,857
the Unsullied, the Second Sons-- 1,000 ships easily.

462
00:46:35,857 --> 00:46:38,008
- Probably more. - And who has that many?

463
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:41,431
Nobody. Nobody yet.

464
00:46:43,644 --> 00:46:47,217
So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.

465
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:50,648
And what then? I take what is mine.

466
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,497
You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palace. What was I made for?

467
00:46:58,222 --> 00:47:00,684
You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.

468
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:10,506
Wait here.

469
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,128
I'M GOING AFTER HER.

470
00:47:49,128 --> 00:47:50,546
WAIT FOR ME HERE.

471
00:48:45,851 --> 00:48:49,313
EVERY KHAL WHO...

472
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:52,941
TO FIGHT BESIDE...

473
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:55,736
BUT I AM...

474
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,156
I WILL NOT...

475
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:02,451
I CHOOSE YOU ALL.

476
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:08,081
I WILL ASK ...

477
00:49:08,665 --> 00:49:10,959
HAS EVER ASKED...

478
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:16,215
WILL YOU RIDE...

479
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:22,095
WILL YOU KILL...

480
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:24,681
AND TEAR DOWN...

481
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:30,103
WILL YOU GIVE...

482
00:49:30,479 --> 00:49:33,774
THE GIFT KHAL...

483
00:49:33,774 --> 00:49:36,109
BEFORE THE MOTHER...

484
00:49:39,029 --> 00:49:41,490
ARE YOU WITH ME?

00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,536
NOW

486
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,457
AND ALWAYS?
