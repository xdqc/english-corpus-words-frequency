4
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,677
Easy, easy.

5
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:04,957
Easy.

6
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,282
What do you remember?

7
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,886
They stabbed me.

8
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:28,851
Olly...

9
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,491
he put a knife in my heart.

10
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,731
I shouldn't be here.

11
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:45,428
The lady brought you back.

12
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:50,131
Afterwards, after they stabbed you,

13
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:52,317
after you died, where did you go?

14
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:53,784
What did you see?

15
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:00,095
Nothing.

16
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,180
There was nothing at all.

17
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:12,175
The Lord let you come back for a reason.

18
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,197
Stannis was not the prince who was promised,

19
00:04:17,197 --> 00:04:18,880
but someone has to be.

20
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,260
Could you give us a moment?

21
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:47,393
You were dead.

22
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:49,606
And now you're not.

23
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:55,535
That's completely fucking mad, seems to me.

24
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:58,193
I can only imagine how it seems to you.

25
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,557
I did what I thought was right.

26
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:07,268
And I got murdered for it.

27
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,240
And now I'm back.

28
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,984
Why? I don't know.

29
00:05:13,757 --> 00:05:15,020
Maybe we'll never know.

30
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,482
What does it matter?

31
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:21,588
You go on.

32
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,175
You fight for as long as you can.

33
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:29,091
You clean up as much of the shit as you can.

34
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,033
I don't know how to do that.

35
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:35,740
I thought I did, but...

36
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,331
I failed.

37
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,588
Good.

38
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,691
Now go fail again.

39
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,348
They think you're some kind of god.

40
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:50,477
The man who returned from the dead.

41
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,500
I'm not a god.

42
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,095
I know that.

43
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,820
I saw your pecker.

44
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,215
What kind of god would have a pecker that small?

45
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:28,211
Your eyes are still brown.

46
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,544
Is that still you in there?

47
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:33,251
I think so.

48
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,495
Hold off on burning my body for now.

49
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,264
That's funny.

50
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,011
You sure that's still you in there?

51
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,873
You all right?

52
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,162
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

53
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,104
Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see

54
00:08:30,104 --> 00:08:33,153
because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?

55
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,611
I don't think so.

56
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,646
Sea, see.

57
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,891
They're spelled different, but they sound the same.

58
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:43,002
Yeah, they do.

59
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,908
It was before I learned how to read, obviously.

60
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,148
Sam, are you going to be sick?

61
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:10,077
Won't be long. We'll be in the south soon.

62
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:12,326
I'm excited to see Oldtown.

63
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:17,510
Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros.

64
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:20,904
Are you going to vomit again?

65
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:22,913
No. No, no, no.

66
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,500
The Citadel doesn't admit women.

67
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:30,575
There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam.

68
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:34,380
I stayed at Castle Black. There's no women allowed there.

69
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,557
The Citadel isn't Castle Black.

70
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,873
I don't have a Jon Snow or Maester Aemon

71
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:41,340
to help me bend the rules.

72
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:44,840
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.

73
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,246
By yourself?

74
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:48,131
With a baby and no money?

75
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:52,957
So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?

76
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:55,384
To my home.

77
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:58,130
Horn Hill.

78
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,913
My father's-- well, my father,

79
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:05,891
but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely.

80
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:08,824
They'll take care of you both.

81
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,628
"Wherever you go, I go, too."

82
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:14,033
<i>That's what you said.</i>

83
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:34,050
I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.

84
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,971
That's all I want--

85
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:39,891
to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes

86
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,757
so you'll be safe.

87
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:45,500
Us and everyone else in the world. I don't care about them.

88
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,738
Well, no, I do, but I don't really.

89
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:53,144
I care about you and him.

90
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,153
I know that, Sam.

91
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,366
And he does, too.

92
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,242
You're the only one who ever has.

93
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,980
If you think it's for the best,

94
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,642
we trust you.

95
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,468
I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.

96
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:25,850
I'd never do that to the father of my son.

97
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:24,442
That's my father.

98
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,504
The man beside him is Howland Reed,

99
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:29,713
Meera's father.

100
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:45,508
Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning.

101
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:48,895
Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw.

102
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:04,504
Lord Stark.

103
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,233
I looked for you on the Trident.

104
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,864
We weren't there. Your friend the usurper

105
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:13,908
would lie beneath the ground if we had been.

106
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:16,628
The Mad King is dead.

107
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:19,322
Rhaegar lies beneath the ground.

108
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:21,864
Why weren't you there to protect your prince?

109
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,713
Our prince wanted us here.

110
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:32,904
Where's my sister?

111
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,131
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

112
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:46,984
And now it begins.

113
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,686
No.

114
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,522
Now it ends.

115
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:35,286
He's better than my father.

116
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:37,153
Far better.

117
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,926
But Father beat him.

118
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:46,140
Did he?

119
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,628
I know he did.

120
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:50,575
Heard the story a thousand times.

121
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,175
He stabbed him in the back.

122
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:30,868
What's in the tower?

123
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:34,940
That's enough for one day. We'll visit again another time.

124
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,375
- I want to see where he's going. - Time to go.

125
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:39,757
Father!

126
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:08,310
Why did you do that?

127
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:10,480
Take me back there. I want to go back.

128
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:11,730
No.

129
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,353
- He heard me. - Maybe.

130
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:19,224
- Maybe he heard the wind. - He heard me.

131
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:23,037
The past is already written. The ink is dry.

132
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,913
What's in that tower?

133
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,788
<i>I want to go back there.</i>

134
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:29,615
I've told you many times, stay too long

135
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,273
where you don't belong and you will never return.

136
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:35,802
Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again?

137
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:38,406
<i>So I can talk to an old man in a tree?</i>

138
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,593
You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years

139
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,169
watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?

140
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,673
So why did you? I was waiting for you.

141
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,650
I don't want to be you.

142
00:17:51,713 --> 00:17:52,904
I don't blame you.

143
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,788
You won't be here forever.

144
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:59,811
You won't be an old man in a tree.

145
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:01,988
<i>But before you leave,</i>

146
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:04,708
you must learn.

147
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:06,904
Learn what?

148
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:09,233
Everything.

149
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:34,442
(HEY,GREAT KHALEESI.MOVE YOUR ASS.)

150
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:12,104
(WELCOME HOME,KHALEESI)

151
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:38,714
(GO)

152
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,549
(WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!)

153
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,969
(TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME!)

154
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,687
(I WILL HAVE YOUR HEADS!)

155
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,579
(YOU HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.)

156
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,669
(ONE YOU WILL REGRET)

157
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,379
(I AM THE WIFE OF THE GREAT KHAL)

158
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,919
(WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE)

159
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,969
(I REMEMBER YOU EATING THE STALLION'S HEART.)

160
00:20:26,053 --> 00:20:30,969
(WHY DIDN'T YOU...)

161
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,219
(BECAUSE...)

162
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,770
(THE BREAKER...)

163
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,019
(THE QUEEN OF...)

164
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,019
(MY PLACE...)

165
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,610
(YOU WERE...)

166
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:46,323
(YOU THOUGHT...)

167
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:47,950
(HE DIDN'T)

168
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:51,620
(I WAS THE...)

169
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:53,163
(KHAL SAVO.)

170
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:59,086
(I THOUGHT...)

171
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:03,215
(YOU'RE YOUNG)

172
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:06,468
(WE WERE...)

173
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:09,888
(BUT WE ALL...)

174
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:12,339
(YOU WILL...)

175
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,394
(IF YOU ARE...)

176
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,771
(WHERE ELSE...)

177
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:20,899
(EVERY KHALEESI...)

178
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:24,945
(YES...)

179
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:26,822
(BUT YOU...)

180
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:28,741
(THAT IS FORBIDDEN)

181
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:34,079
(ALL THE...)

182
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:40,210
(THEY WILL...)

183
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:44,840
(AND NOW THEY...)

184
00:21:45,716 --> 00:21:48,839
(WITH LUCK...)

185
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,847
(IT IS THE...)

186
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:06,317
I don't know how you stand it in all that leather.

187
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,393
If we could have the room.

188
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,424
You look lovely today, my dear. You really do.

189
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:32,806
How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat.

190
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:36,308
If you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it.

191
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,175
I am not a torturer.

192
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,411
Though it so often is what people deserve.

193
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,144
And it does provide answers.

194
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:50,540
But they're usually the wrong answers.

195
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:54,193
My job is to find the right answers.

196
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:55,944
Do you know how I do that?

197
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,117
I do it by making people happy.

198
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,468
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

199
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,322
That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

200
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,140
That's all right.

201
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:11,390
I know who you are and what you've done.

202
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,162
You've done a lot. You've sacrificed your body for a cause,

203
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,108
which is more than most people do.

204
00:23:21,393 --> 00:23:23,766
And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy

205
00:23:23,766 --> 00:23:26,637
murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.

206
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:30,477
The Unsullied and the Second Sons are foreign soldiers

207
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:34,433
brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.

208
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:37,064
I understand.

209
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:40,335
Well, that makes perfect sense

210
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,148
from your perspective.

211
00:23:43,846 --> 00:23:47,224
I have a different perspective, of course.

212
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,940
I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective

213
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,242
just as I will try to see them from yours.

214
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,775
Because that is the only way

215
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:58,770
that I can make you and Dom happy.

216
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,415
That is how you pronounce it-- Dom?

217
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:08,780
I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.

218
00:24:10,193 --> 00:24:11,917
Such a handsome boy.

219
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:15,748
Those big, brown eyes. Good luck keeping the ladies away.

220
00:24:16,984 --> 00:24:19,864
Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?

221
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:23,260
You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son.

222
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,322
Children are blameless.

223
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:28,113
I have never hurt them.

224
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:32,842
Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you.

225
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,255
But between us, dear,

226
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,015
you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.

227
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:42,611
We both know the penalty for that crime.

228
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:50,851
How will poor Dom get on without his mother?

229
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:55,517
And with his breathing problem. If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

230
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,326
So either you kill me or they do.

231
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:01,624
Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.

232
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,357
There is a third option, though.

233
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:08,940
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

234
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,877
I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son.

235
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:17,268
I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again.

236
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:19,046
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

237
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:22,442
one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it.

238
00:25:22,726 --> 00:25:24,495
Far too heavy for me.

239
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,535
The boat sails at dawn.

240
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:29,882
You need to decide now.

241
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,375
A new life for you and Dom

242
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:34,717
or...

243
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:54,966
What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do?

244
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:56,548
<i>What should we talk about?</i>

245
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:01,757
You speak 19 languages.

246
00:26:01,757 --> 00:26:04,353
You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things.

247
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:08,433
You two, you spend a great deal of time together.

248
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,028
What would you be talking about if I weren't here?

249
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:13,233
Patrol.

250
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,597
When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.

251
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,837
What we see on patrol.

252
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:22,086
Who we captured on patrol.

253
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,593
That's good. That's very good.

254
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,451
But that's a report.

255
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,402
I was thinking more of a conversation.

256
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,620
A wise man once said the true history of the world

257
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,548
is the history of great conversations in elegant rooms.

258
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:40,362
Who said this?

259
00:26:41,384 --> 00:26:42,210
Me.

260
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:43,953
Just now.

261
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:53,091
All right, no conversations.

262
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,100
Let's play a game.

263
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,962
You don't play games, either one of you, ever?

264
00:26:59,962 --> 00:27:01,180
Games are for children.

265
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,762
<i>My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.</i>

266
00:27:04,762 --> 00:27:07,046
There, that's a start.

267
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:10,460
- Only the girls. - No, no, no.

268
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,593
Not that. Of course not that.

269
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,917
Innocent games. Fun games. Drinking games.

270
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,820
<i>We do not drink.</i>

271
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,837
Until you do.

272
00:27:24,548 --> 00:27:27,686
All right. No drinking. We can play without drinking.

273
00:27:28,237 --> 00:27:30,199
It's a wonderful game. I invented it.

274
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,935
Here's how it works. I make a statement about your past.

275
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:35,837
If I'm wrong, I drink.

276
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:37,233
And if I'm right--

277
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,411
maybe we can't play without drinking.

278
00:27:44,193 --> 00:27:46,580
Oh, you took your time.

279
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:48,255
Sorry.

280
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,406
I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy.

281
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,744
- Some things you can't rush. - You found out?

282
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:56,966
The Good Masters of Astapor

283
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,251
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

284
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:02,184
With help from their friends in Volantis.

285
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:03,233
<i>You see?</i>

286
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:06,060
You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion.

287
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:07,837
We only have to worry about

288
00:28:07,837 --> 00:28:10,069
the three rich foreign cities paying for it.

289
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,015
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.

290
00:28:12,015 --> 00:28:14,148
We will do it again and execute the Masters.

291
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:17,224
If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai,

292
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,975
who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?

293
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,473
If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?

294
00:28:21,473 --> 00:28:22,611
We cannot.

295
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:26,193
The Masters speak only one language.

296
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:29,926
<i>They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue.</i>

297
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:33,428
If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them.

298
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:36,104
May it be the last thing they ever hear.

299
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,202
You may be right.

300
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:39,624
<i>So we will fight them?</i>

301
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,260
- Possibly. - Possibly?

302
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:44,362
It's a conversation.

303
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,722
Tell me, can your little birds get a message

304
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:50,931
to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

305
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,580
and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

306
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,308
Of course. Men can be fickle,

307
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:58,797
but birds I always trust.

308
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,722
Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

309
00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:11,295
How's your mother's jaw? Better.

310
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:13,464
And your father?

311
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:15,920
No one's seen him.

312
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:18,788
And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.

313
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:21,064
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

314
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,406
I don't think so.

315
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:24,531
Do you miss him?

316
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:26,762
He was nice.

317
00:29:28,344 --> 00:29:30,326
He called us his little birds.

318
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:32,148
He gave us sweets.

319
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:36,220
It's funny you should mention that.

320
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,988
Guess what I happened to find today.

321
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:45,615
Candied plums from Dorne.

322
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:52,104
Now remember, if any of your friends

323
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:55,330
like sweets or need help, they can always come to me.

324
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:59,811
All I need in return are whispers.

325
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:11,126
<i>No need to be afraid. This is Ser Gregor.</i>

326
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:13,633
He's friends with all my friends.

327
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:20,060
Run along now.

328
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,665
Varys's little birds?

329
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,313
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

330
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:33,277
What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.

331
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:35,224
Oh, a number of things.

332
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,682
Does he understand what we're saying?

333
00:30:36,682 --> 00:30:41,393
I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place.

334
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:45,169
He understands well enough.

335
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,331
So tell him to march into the sept

336
00:30:47,331 --> 00:30:50,140
and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon.

337
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,873
The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him.

338
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,015
Ser Gregor can't face them all.

339
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:57,544
And he won't have to.

340
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,828
He'll only have to face one.

341
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:04,842
Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?

342
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:05,828
Not yet.

343
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,828
That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.

344
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,348
Don't stop at the city.

345
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,077
I want little birds in Dorne,

346
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,910
in Highgarden, in the North.

347
00:31:17,286 --> 00:31:20,077
If someone is planning on making our losses their gains,

348
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:21,526
I want to hear it.

349
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:24,753
If someone is laughing at the queen

350
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:27,535
who walked naked through the streets covered in shit,

351
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:28,708
I want to hear.

352
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:31,473
I want to know who they are.

353
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,077
I want to know where they are.

354
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,953
<i>As bad as Lord Varys was, Qyburn is worse.</i>

355
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:46,113
I told them all. I told them.

356
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,513
He's arrogant, dangerous.

357
00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:51,437
You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason.

358
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:54,833
<i>And no one listened to my advice. So here we are.</i>

359
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:59,260
<i>And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination.</i>

360
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,860
We never sanctioned this experiment.

361
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,562
I for one think it will be in our best interest

362
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:06,957
to have the beast dest--

363
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:14,611
- Can I help you? - Why are you here?

364
00:32:14,806 --> 00:32:17,348
- My mother-- - I was invited, my dear,

365
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:20,371
to help deal with several troublesome issues,

366
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,646
such as the queen's imprisonment.

367
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:24,220
Thank you for bringing it up.

368
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:28,820
It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.

369
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:30,886
Margaery is the queen.

370
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:35,153
<i>You are not the queen because you're not married to the king.</i>

371
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:39,935
I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.

372
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,895
This is a small council meeting.

373
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,144
You have no position on the small council.

374
00:32:45,144 --> 00:32:46,868
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

375
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,460
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the small council.

376
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,571
Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?

377
00:32:53,855 --> 00:32:54,948
Well, um...

378
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:58,140
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower

379
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,479
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

380
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,984
<i>Of course, that was the Mad King.</i>

381
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:05,562
King Robert saw things differently. And King--

382
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:11,793
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

383
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:16,593
Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?

384
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:19,171
The same women who murdered Myrcella

385
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,828
have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne.

386
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:24,771
We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.

387
00:33:26,744 --> 00:33:29,710
And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it.

388
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:33,402
No, we cannot make you leave.

389
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:36,513
And you cannot make us stay.

390
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:41,171
Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all.

391
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:24,566
Your Grace.

392
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:27,971
My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place.

393
00:34:28,415 --> 00:34:30,388
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

394
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:32,691
That's not possible. Not yet.

395
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:36,566
When will it be possible? When she's fully atoned for her sins.

396
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,286
You cut off her hair and marched her naked

397
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,588
through the streets in front of the whole city.

398
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:43,731
That wasn't the full atonement?

399
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:44,735
No.

400
00:34:45,677 --> 00:34:48,495
She must stand trial before seven septons

401
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,046
so we can learn the true extent of her sins.

402
00:34:51,046 --> 00:34:55,117
I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place.

403
00:34:55,117 --> 00:34:56,877
I am the king.

404
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:57,757
You are.

405
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:02,371
And what does that mean to you?

406
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:03,846
<i>It means a great deal to me.</i>

407
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:07,908
The Crown and the Faith are the twin pillars of the world.

408
00:35:08,646 --> 00:35:10,060
<i>Do you know who told me that?</i>

409
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:15,108
Your mother. My mother who is unclean?

410
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:19,482
My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?

411
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:41,482
How do you think the Mother Above first came to us?

412
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,397
How did men and women

413
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:47,930
first come to feel the Mother's presence, hmm?

414
00:35:49,197 --> 00:35:51,037
It was through their own mothers.

415
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,304
There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei. You know that.

416
00:35:57,304 --> 00:36:01,348
But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.

417
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,255
Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world

418
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:10,566
because it doesn't come from this world.

419
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:13,670
But you know that.

420
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:15,277
You've felt it.

421
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:18,495
You've seen her when she talks to you.

422
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:21,917
Yes.

423
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,024
<i>It's a great gift.</i>

424
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,166
One I never had.

425
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,455
Envy.

426
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:33,028
One more thing for me to atone for.

427
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:36,344
Your Grace, do you-- may I?

428
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:39,455
Do you mind? It's my knees.

429
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:41,393
Of course.

430
00:36:47,073 --> 00:36:50,228
When your mother made her walk of atonement,

431
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:53,393
she did it to get back to you.

432
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,015
I still don't understand why you want to put her

433
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,633
through any more than she's already endured.

434
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:01,535
It's not what I want. It's what the gods want.

435
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:06,317
<i>They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it.</i>

436
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:09,900
Please.

437
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,842
If we're to be just and good,

438
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,837
then we accept it, all of us, even kings.

439
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:26,060
A true leader avails himself of the wisest counsel he can.

440
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,495
And no one is wiser than the gods.

441
00:37:31,313 --> 00:37:33,526
My grandfather once said something similar.

442
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,824
Except for the part about the gods.

443
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,140
The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not.

444
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:43,224
As they work through your mother.

445
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,668
There's so much good in all of us.

446
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:50,948
The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.

447
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,540
Who are you?

448
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,611
No one.

449
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,895
<i>Who were you before you came here?</i>

450
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:29,310
<i>Arya Stark.</i>

451
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,464
<i>Tell me about Arya Stark's family.</i>

452
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:35,997
Her father was Eddard Stark.

453
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:38,860
Her mother was Catelyn Stark.

454
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,664
She had one sister, Sansa,

455
00:38:43,962 --> 00:38:45,233
and four brothers.

456
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:55,704
Three brothers.

457
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:59,153
<i>Robb, Bran, Rickon.</i>

458
00:39:01,384 --> 00:39:03,971
And a half-brother Jon.

459
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,735
And where are they now?

460
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:10,211
<i>They may be dead for all a girl knows.</i>

461
00:39:20,913 --> 00:39:22,282
Tell me about the Hound.

462
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,597
<i>Also dead.</i>

463
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:39,171
<i>Arya Stark left him to die. He was on her list.</i>

464
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:43,793
He was not on her list anymore.

465
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,842
She had taken him off it.

466
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:50,815
Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?

467
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:56,602
<i>She did and she did not.</i>

468
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:02,922
She sounds confused.

469
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:12,042
Yes, she was.

470
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:19,295
Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?

471
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:22,060
<i> Cersei Lannister.</i>

472
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:25,197
<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>

473
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,166
<i>Walder Frey.</i>

474
00:40:32,228 --> 00:40:33,864
<i>That's a short list.</i>

475
00:40:38,664 --> 00:40:41,304
<i>That can't be everyone you want to kill.</i>

476
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,628
Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?

477
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,468
Which name would you like a girl to speak?

478
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,637
<i>If a girl tells me her name,</i>

479
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,584
I will give her eyes back.

480
00:41:36,611 --> 00:41:38,006
A girl has no name.

481
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,428
Come.

482
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:18,682
If a girl is truly no one,

483
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:20,691
<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>

484
00:42:47,028 --> 00:42:48,166
Who are you?

485
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:53,331
No one.

486
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:06,700
The Umbers are a famously loyal house.

487
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:09,215
Famously loyal to the Starks.

488
00:43:09,215 --> 00:43:12,042
And you, Lord Karstark.

489
00:43:12,895 --> 00:43:15,290
Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they?

490
00:43:15,642 --> 00:43:17,873
But here we are. Times change.

491
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,566
When my father became Warden of the North,

492
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:22,708
<i>your house refused to pledge their banners.</i>

493
00:43:22,788 --> 00:43:24,060
Your father was a cunt.

494
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,695
My beloved father, the Warden--

495
00:43:29,695 --> 00:43:33,295
Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him.

496
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,300
<i>I might have done the same to my father</i>

497
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,575
if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own.

498
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:41,340
My father was poisoned by our enemies.

499
00:43:44,086 --> 00:43:46,860
Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?

500
00:43:47,117 --> 00:43:50,237
The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.

501
00:43:51,473 --> 00:43:53,704
We're farther north than any of you fuckers.

502
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:56,788
<i>Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.</i>

503
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,695
I like fighting wildlings. Been doing it all my life.

504
00:44:00,451 --> 00:44:02,726
But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone.

505
00:44:03,002 --> 00:44:05,686
So now you've come seeking help?

506
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:07,597
We need to help each other.

507
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:11,642
The colder it gets, the farther south those goat fuckers will roam.

508
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:13,748
Won't take them long to get here.

509
00:44:13,748 --> 00:44:16,682
You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell?

510
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:18,824
If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.

511
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:20,744
<i>He knows this place better than we ever will.</i>

512
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:26,184
Pledge your banners to House Bolton.

513
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,030
Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North

514
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:31,455
and we will fight together to destroy the bastard

515
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:33,455
and all his wildling friends.

516
00:44:33,455 --> 00:44:35,331
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

517
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:38,380
Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord.

518
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:39,864
I'm not doing that either.

519
00:44:40,282 --> 00:44:43,251
Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?

520
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:45,544
Your father honored tradition.

521
00:44:47,135 --> 00:44:48,868
<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>

522
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,628
Called him King of the North.

523
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:53,526
<i>Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?</i>

524
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:55,624
Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.

525
00:44:55,624 --> 00:44:58,291
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.

526
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:00,122
I've got a gift for you.

527
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:06,246
A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.

528
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:08,584
A girl, aye.

529
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:11,944
<i>A wild one.</i>

530
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:21,846
I like them wild.

531
00:45:22,913 --> 00:45:26,380
And the boy, nice and young.

532
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:28,362
The way Karstark likes them.

533
00:45:35,313 --> 00:45:36,237
Who's this?

534
00:45:36,628 --> 00:45:37,900
Rickon Stark.

535
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,873
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

536
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:21,286
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

537
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:34,060
It's time.

538
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:14,931
If you have any last words, now is the time.

539
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:18,931
You shouldn't be alive. It's not right.

540
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:22,406
Neither was killing me.

541
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:28,708
My mother's still living at White Harbor.

542
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,633
Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

543
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:45,713
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

544
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:50,068
Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

545
00:47:50,566 --> 00:47:53,473
You brought an army of wildlings into our lands.

546
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,615
An army of murderers and raiders.

547
00:47:58,371 --> 00:48:01,286
If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up,

548
00:48:02,344 --> 00:48:04,620
I pray I'd make the right choice again.

549
00:48:05,722 --> 00:48:07,517
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

550
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,584
I fought, I lost.

551
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:14,122
Now I rest.

552
00:48:15,348 --> 00:48:18,237
But you, Lord Snow,

553
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:21,775
you'll be fighting their battles forever.

554
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:10,744
We should burn the bodies.

555
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:13,686
You should.

556
00:50:23,162 --> 00:50:24,771
What do you want me to do with this?

557
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,344
Wear it.

558
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:27,997
Burn it.

559
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,211
Whatever you want.

560
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:32,780
You have Castle Black.

561
00:50:40,051 --> 00:50:41,366
My watch is ended.
