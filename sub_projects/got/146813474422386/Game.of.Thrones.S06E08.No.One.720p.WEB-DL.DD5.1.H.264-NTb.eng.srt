
4
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:56,237
My son.

5
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:00,655
My firstborn son.

6
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:07,562
My child king, hush.

7
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,510
Listen to the gods, for you they sing.

8
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,793
Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won.

9
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,637
The wolves are buried and the false stag done.

10
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:35,277
Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall.

11
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,935
The Father above beckons you to his hall.

12
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:42,264
In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more.

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,344
But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore

14
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:55,864
and my brother the Imp who killed his own king.

15
00:02:57,126 --> 00:02:59,748
Born amongst lions, our curse from within.

16
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:01,660
I will slay him, I swear.

17
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:04,335
With noose or with knife,

18
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,108
though it take me a fortnight,

19
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:10,922
a moon or my life.

20
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,602
What is that I hear and smell?

21
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:41,420
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

22
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:47,642
It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

23
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:48,740
Get the wig!

24
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:52,788
You beast, you beast. You killed my wife.

25
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:55,482
And now you've taken your father's life.

26
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:59,091
No worse child ever stained this land.

27
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,802
I curse the day I named you.

28
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,628
My greatest crime!

29
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,180
You're good at that.

30
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,628
Where did you learn?

31
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:45,597
I'm a jealous woman.

32
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:50,211
I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me.

33
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:58,015
They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.

34
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,997
So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them.

35
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:06,842
And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up.

36
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:10,131
I got good at patching them up. And good at putting holes in them.

37
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:12,157
And that.

38
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:17,330
What happened to the actress?

39
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:19,411
The one who wanted you dead.

40
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,077
Bianca.

41
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,895
She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.

42
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,206
I never did learn to cook.

43
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:38,380
But eat. Eat. You need it.

44
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:44,895
The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.

45
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,366
- I can't. - Why not?

46
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,731
Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work.

47
00:05:49,828 --> 00:05:52,042
And besides, we need a new actress.

48
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:55,277
I don't think I could remember all of the lines.

49
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,215
Come with us.

50
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:00,170
What's left for you here?

51
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,055
You wouldn't be safe.

52
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:06,220
Not while she's looking for me.

53
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:08,273
Who?

54
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,126
She doesn't have a name.

55
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,160
Where will you go?

56
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:24,273
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

57
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,806
But what's west of Westeros?

58
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:29,206
I don't know.

59
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,664
Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.

60
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:36,797
The edge of the world, maybe. I'd like to see that.

61
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,731
- What's that? - Milk of the poppy.

62
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:51,677
I don't want any.

63
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:55,846
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

64
00:06:56,957 --> 00:07:00,468
Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.

65
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,380
Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.

66
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,900
I was a famous kisser.

67
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:50,180
You lads know how to kiss proper?

68
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:56,531
Course we do. This is for masters, this technique.

69
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,202
- You're not ready. - I'm ready.

70
00:07:58,202 --> 00:07:59,402
He says he's ready.

71
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:03,713
All right. Now, pay attention.

72
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:09,437
You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.

73
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,437
Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.

74
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,864
Very romantic.

75
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,984
Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.

76
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:28,148
So fucking close! Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

77
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:30,220
Look at him. You get hard, boy?

78
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,206
Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.

79
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,597
Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?

80
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,153
Where's the other one?

81
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:06,033
- The one with the yellow cloak. - Fuck you!

82
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,980
Those are your last words, fuck you?

83
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,766
Come on, you can do better. Cunt!

84
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:14,246
You're shit at dying, you know that?

85
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:33,099
FROM THE FIRE...

86
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,448
DAENERYS IS A...

87
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:42,869
IF WE ARE...

88
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:46,873
NO MAN WILL...

89
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,076
I'd call that a successful gambit.

90
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,255
- Would you? - Look around.

91
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:54,193
The city has come back to life.

92
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:58,113
- You made a pact with fanatics. - I did and it worked.

93
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,077
If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.

94
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:04,090
That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.

95
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:07,580
Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.

96
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:15,188
I'm going to miss you. I know.

97
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,797
I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.

98
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,006
If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.

99
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,660
We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.

100
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,304
Most of all, we need our queen.

101
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:34,344
She'll come back. She has to.

102
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:37,375
My heart's been broken too many times already.

103
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,060
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

104
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,442
I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.

105
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:51,011
Varys.

106
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:55,322
The most famous dwarf in the world.

107
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:28,388
Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.

108
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:30,344
Have been permitted?

109
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:33,526
That's rather a tortured way of putting it.

110
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:36,184
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

111
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,522
Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?

112
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:45,180
The king is aware of their presence? He is, Your Grace.

113
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,944
He's currently in his chambers at prayer.

114
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:08,557
Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.

115
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:13,295
His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.

116
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,988
Your Grace, this is not a request.

117
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:18,104
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

118
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:20,895
You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.

119
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:25,171
The High Septon commands you.

120
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:27,820
Are you sure you want to refuse him?

121
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:33,180
He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.

122
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,322
He made no such promises.

123
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,348
If you refuse to come of your own free will--

124
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:38,486
Get out.

125
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,175
Move aside, ser.

126
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:56,353
Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.

127
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:05,686
I choose violence.

128
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:50,255
Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.

129
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:03,748
Looks like a siege, my lady.

130
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,695
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

131
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,366
My lady. My lady.

132
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:24,486
Who goes there?!

133
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:29,117
State your business! My name is Brienne of Tarth.

134
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:32,486
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him.

135
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,913
Tell him I have his sword.

136
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,895
Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?

137
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,140
Podrick fucking Payne.

138
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:00,531
I thought you'd be dead by now.

139
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:01,420
Not yet.

140
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,651
- Are they in there? - Uh-huh.

141
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:10,948
You think they're fucking?

142
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:14,184
What? No.

143
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,224
Why not? I'd fuck her.

144
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:19,820
You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

145
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,526
- I'm her squire. - Oh.

146
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,517
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

147
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:28,584
And she'd fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him.

148
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:31,926
The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.

149
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,904
I preferred working with the little brother on that account.

150
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,295
Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.

151
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,086
You must have shown it to her by now.

152
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:47,277
- She's training me to fight. - Is she?

153
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:49,766
Oh. - An hour in the morning, an hour at night.

154
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:50,931
Every day.

155
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,642
Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?

156
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:58,317
Well, that's a different sort of fighting.

157
00:15:58,317 --> 00:16:02,193
Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?

158
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:04,815
All right.

159
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:08,131
All right, let's start with your footwork.

160
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,926
Show me your stance.

161
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:13,375
Now listen to me, Pod.

162
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,651
See how your feet are about a yard apart?

163
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,251
Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.

164
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:22,228
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.

165
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,228
Do it again. Come on, don't sulk.

166
00:16:26,228 --> 00:16:29,908
I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.

167
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,837
Why would you assume that?

168
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:35,251
In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.

169
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:37,944
I don't think you know many girls like her.

170
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,193
Well, I'm proud of you.

171
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:45,224
I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.

172
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:48,655
Of course, my sister wants Sansa dead.

173
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:51,549
The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder,

174
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,260
so there is that complication.

175
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:58,557
What the hell are you doing here?

176
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:00,170
I've come for the Blackfish.

177
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,070
You're welcome to have him.

178
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:06,308
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons

179
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:09,526
and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.

180
00:17:09,526 --> 00:17:12,628
With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?

181
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:14,077
The Tully army.

182
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:15,926
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

183
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:19,446
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels,

184
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,117
so you can see the conundrum.

185
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:23,686
The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?

186
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:26,193
Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.

187
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:29,464
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.

188
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:30,566
Exactly.

189
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:38,628
We shouldn't argue about politics. You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

190
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:41,242
I know there is honor in you.

191
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,340
- I've seen it myself. - I'm a Lannister.

192
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,620
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

193
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,184
I do no such thing.

194
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:51,390
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

195
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:55,224
Ride south again with your mission complete and your army intact.

196
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,806
What do you propose?

197
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,406
Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce.

198
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:03,135
Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.

199
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,624
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?

200
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:09,188
Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.

201
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,006
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

202
00:18:16,184 --> 00:18:18,510
- No. - He's even more stubborn than you are.

203
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:20,860
All right.

204
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,544
Try to talk some sense into the old goat.

205
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:25,677
He won't listen, but his men might.

206
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,424
Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.

207
00:18:29,002 --> 00:18:30,246
I need your word.

208
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:35,731
If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant a safe passage north.

209
00:18:36,397 --> 00:18:37,606
You have my word.

210
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:40,246
You have until nightfall.

211
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:59,633
You gave it to me for a purpose.

212
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,064
I've achieved that purpose.

213
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:07,900
It's yours.

214
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:11,375
It will always be yours.

215
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,117
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

216
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,135
Yes, Lady Brienne?

217
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:31,340
Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle,

218
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:35,073
honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.

219
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,993
Of course it does.

220
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,117
To fight you.

221
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:45,420
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

222
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,335
I've said no three times already.

223
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,424
I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.

224
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:02,460
I haven't seen her since she was a child.

225
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,797
I don't know her signature. I don't know you.

226
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:08,264
And I will not surrender. Double the guards tonight.

227
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:11,837
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

228
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:12,984
I can feel it.

229
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,126
As I have said, my name is-- Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.

230
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,046
- Good man. - He always spoke highly of you.

231
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:23,873
And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

232
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:29,073
If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool.

233
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:31,677
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.

234
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:35,313
We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.

235
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:37,820
- He's not my friend. - No?

236
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:42,495
Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle?

237
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,571
Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?

238
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:49,030
Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark.

239
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:52,895
He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted.

240
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,895
He gave me this sword to protect her.

241
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:59,277
That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.

242
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,420
She's exactly like her mother.

243
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:24,851
I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.

244
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,895
You have more than she does.

245
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:29,135
She wants her home back. I understand that.

246
00:21:29,837 --> 00:21:31,233
But this is my home.

247
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,757
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

248
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:37,260
he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.

249
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,073
Find the maester.

250
00:21:57,153 --> 00:21:59,357
We need to get a raven north to Sansa.

251
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:02,566
What should I write?

252
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:07,571
Tell her I failed.

253
00:22:38,673 --> 00:22:40,504
There's to be a royal announcement?

254
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:42,104
There is.

255
00:22:42,424 --> 00:22:43,846
Why wasn't I informed?

256
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,024
There is to be a royal announcement

257
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:53,064
in the throne room at this very moment.

258
00:22:56,415 --> 00:22:57,784
Where are you going?

259
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:03,117
To stand by my son.

260
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:08,477
Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.

261
00:23:16,317 --> 00:23:17,491
Your Grace...

262
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:38,308
Lords and ladies,

263
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,580
the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world.

264
00:23:44,797 --> 00:23:48,068
One collapses, so does the other.

265
00:23:49,784 --> 00:23:52,110
The Father judges us all.

266
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:54,095
If you break his laws...

267
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,371
you will be punished.

268
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:03,926
After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon,

269
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,824
we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei Lannister's trial

270
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:13,588
will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

271
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:24,042
Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection,

272
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:28,335
the Crown has decided that from this day forward,

273
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:32,033
trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

274
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,202
The tradition is a brutish one,

275
00:24:36,797 --> 00:24:41,473
a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods.

276
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,971
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell

277
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:48,460
will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith.

278
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,602
Seven blessings to all.

279
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,073
Seven blessings.

280
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,468
Your Grace...

281
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:21,526
that old rumor you told me about.

282
00:25:23,117 --> 00:25:25,180
My little birds investigated.

283
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:28,486
And?

284
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:32,797
Was it just a rumor or something more?

285
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,744
More.

286
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:38,415
Much more.

287
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:46,504
You seem happy.

288
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:48,664
I am happy.

289
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:52,042
You should both be happy as well.

290
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:56,468
Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.

291
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,108
Now it's like a man reborn.

292
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,855
I will be happy when our queen returns.

293
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:05,055
Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?

294
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:06,531
Unsullied never drink.

295
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,926
- Why not? - Rules.

296
00:26:07,926 --> 00:26:09,828
And who made these rules?

297
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:11,935
Your former masters?

298
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:15,917
Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human.

299
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:17,606
Have a drink with me.

300
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:23,953
And you? What's your excuse?

301
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,326
I have tried wine before.

302
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:28,637
It made me feel funny.

303
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:30,291
That's how you know it's working.

304
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:34,353
Here's to our queen.

305
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,708
Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.

306
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:44,317
To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,

307
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:47,224
Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.

308
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,780
- Long may she reign. - Long may she reign.

309
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,744
Do you like it? Tastes like it has turned.

310
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:02,042
Yes, yes. Fermentation.

311
00:27:05,784 --> 00:27:10,300
One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...

312
00:27:12,042 --> 00:27:13,588
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

313
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:16,806
Make my own wine.

314
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:20,024
The Imp's Delight.

315
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:23,215
Only my close friends could drink it.

316
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:29,108
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

317
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,086
I do not know any jokes.

318
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,313
Grey Worm?

319
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:36,877
Right.

320
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:42,522
Three lords walk into a tavern--

321
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,073
a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

322
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:49,402
They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over,

323
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,397
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

324
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:56,655
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.

325
00:27:56,815 --> 00:28:00,673
The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.

326
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:04,691
The Stark reaches into his cup,

327
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:08,246
pulls out the fly and shouts,

328
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:11,064
"Spit it out, you wee shit.

329
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,584
Spit it out."

330
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,077
It's funnier in Westeros.

331
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:23,953
The Starks and the Lannisters, I thought these were enemies.

332
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:24,886
Yes.

333
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,060
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

334
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,904
Not a true story, necessarily.

335
00:28:30,904 --> 00:28:34,068
A story that's supposed to make you laugh ideally.

336
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:35,944
Not at the moment, perhaps.

337
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:38,433
Missandei, do you like the wine?

338
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:39,800
I do.

339
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:41,437
Tell a joke.

340
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:50,691
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

341
00:28:51,793 --> 00:28:55,935
The first says, "Do you know how to swim?"

342
00:28:56,806 --> 00:29:00,931
The second says, "No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages."

343
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:14,060
That is the worst joke I ever heard. You don't even know what a joke is.

344
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,348
I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?

345
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:19,268
You lied to us.

346
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:22,380
I make joke.

347
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:34,264
More jokes.

348
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:38,744
I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass.

349
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,095
The madam says--

350
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:56,228
The Masters have come for their property.

351
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:15,651
Lord Edmure.

352
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,077
I apologize for the way the Freys treated you.

353
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,460
A man of your birth deserves better.

354
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:26,006
You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothed from now on.

355
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:29,944
I have your word?

356
00:30:33,046 --> 00:30:34,033
Oh, good.

357
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,451
Good, that's--

358
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:39,150
that's a fine thing.

359
00:30:41,268 --> 00:30:44,113
My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser.

360
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,988
Whatever game you're playing. The Blackfish is an old man.

361
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,495
A good death is all he can hope for.

362
00:30:50,495 --> 00:30:53,491
But you, you have a child now, I've heard.

363
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:59,348
A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man.

364
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:05,944
A son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.

365
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:07,357
You should be with them both.

366
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,011
I can arrange that, you realize?

367
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,420
Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock.

368
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:16,913
A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride.

369
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,162
And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own.

370
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,562
Do you imagine yourself a decent person?

371
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,651
Is that it?

372
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,686
After you've massacred my family.

373
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Kept me in a cell for years.

374
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:32,886
Stolen our lands.

375
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:35,766
I'll remind you that our houses are at war.

376
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:38,095
I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you,

377
00:31:38,095 --> 00:31:40,646
but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.

378
00:31:40,646 --> 00:31:42,993
Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.

379
00:31:42,993 --> 00:31:46,966
Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.

380
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,015
You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.

381
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:57,997
I'll leave the judgments to the gods. Well, that is convenient for you.

382
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:05,633
You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?

383
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:12,282
Your square jaw, your golden armor.

384
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:17,331
Tell me, I want to know.

385
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:18,557
I truly do.

386
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,726
How do you live with yourself?

387
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:29,360
All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we?

388
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:31,428
You have to sleep at night.

389
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:36,708
How do you tell yourself that you're decent

390
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:40,388
after everything that you've done?

391
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:48,966
I was your sister's prisoner once.

392
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:55,544
She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.

393
00:32:58,753 --> 00:32:59,668
Yeah.

394
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,162
She should have killed you.

395
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,002
Perhaps, but she didn't.

396
00:33:06,628 --> 00:33:10,246
Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me.

397
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,166
But I didn't hate her.

398
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,110
I admired her.

399
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:16,477
Far more than her husband or her son.

400
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:18,531
Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?

401
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:21,100
No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner.

402
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,877
You don't have a choice.

403
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:25,580
The love she had for her children,

404
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:27,464
I was a little awed by it.

405
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:29,455
Reminded me of my sister.

406
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:33,330
Oh. Oh, I see.

407
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:36,824
You're a madman.

408
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:39,260
I'm not here to trade insults.

409
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,157
- Your sister was a strong-- - Don't talk about Cat!

410
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,117
I'll talk about whomever I want.

411
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:48,362
She loved her children.

412
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,375
I suppose all mothers do,

413
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,766
but Catelyn and Cersei,

414
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,620
there's a fierceness you don't often see.

415
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:59,233
They'd do anything to protect their babies.

416
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:01,162
Start a war.

417
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,557
Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies.

418
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,331
The things we do for love.

419
00:34:12,157 --> 00:34:14,797
You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.

420
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,451
That's exactly why I came here.

421
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,517
I love Cersei.

422
00:34:23,073 --> 00:34:24,495
You can laugh at that if you want.

423
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,335
You can sneer. Doesn't matter.

424
00:34:26,957 --> 00:34:28,175
She needs me.

425
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:32,104
And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun.

426
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,740
I'll send for your baby boy.

427
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,611
And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult.

428
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,437
Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure.

429
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:48,504
Your son doesn't matter to me.

430
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:52,264
The people in the castle don't matter to me.

431
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,224
Only Cersei.

432
00:34:57,357 --> 00:34:59,988
And if I have to slaughter every Tully

433
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:02,264
who ever lived to get back to her,

434
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,940
that's what I'll do.

435
00:35:32,877 --> 00:35:34,220
Who goes there?

436
00:35:35,482 --> 00:35:36,744
Edmure Tully,

437
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:40,690
son of Hoster Tully and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

438
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,260
I demand entry.

439
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,331
Don't let him in.

440
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:52,077
He's the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.

441
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:56,122
He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding.

442
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:59,811
Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding

443
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:02,077
would decide to let him come home?

444
00:36:03,473 --> 00:36:05,597
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

445
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:07,855
Don't let him in.

446
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:09,384
He's my lord, my lord.

447
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:12,433
I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.

448
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:15,366
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

449
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,117
You're obeying the fucking Kingslayer's commands.

450
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:23,615
I demand entry. My lord has given an order.

451
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,731
With a knife to his throat.

452
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,970
That is not a valid order.

453
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:35,037
Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed--

454
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:35,864
Aye, ser.

455
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,002
I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.

456
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:44,842
You are not lord of this castle, my lord.

457
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,170
- Lower the drawbridge. - Aye, ser!

458
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:49,144
If you're wrong, we've just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.

459
00:38:29,135 --> 00:38:30,433
Welcome home, my lord.

460
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:39,206
Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms.

461
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:42,753
Open the gates.

462
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:45,348
- My lord-- - Your lord has given a command.

463
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,593
Infantry, advance!

464
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:37,580
Find the Blackfish.

465
00:39:39,073 --> 00:39:41,980
Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.

466
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,375
Find him.

467
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:13,411
Go on.

468
00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:16,042
Come with us.

469
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:17,766
I've run before from the Red Wedding.

470
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:20,237
I'm not running again. This is my family home.

471
00:40:20,237 --> 00:40:23,944
Your family is in the North. Come with us.

472
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:26,957
Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.

473
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,184
You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.

474
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,966
All the way down!

475
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:40,548
- Check that out! - Go on, now.

476
00:40:42,015 --> 00:40:44,913
I haven't had a proper sword fight in years.

477
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,828
I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.

478
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:23,988
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

479
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,846
Good.

480
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,384
Bring him to me.

481
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,002
He died fighting, my lord.

482
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:03,757
- I was wrong. I admit it. - That changes nothing.

483
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:06,095
The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead.

484
00:43:06,095 --> 00:43:09,428
If the slavers' forces-- No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.

485
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:10,868
And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying--

486
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,708
You're trying to tell me what the army should do.

487
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,602
You do not know what the army should do.

488
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:19,606
All right, what should the army do? We'll not go to the beach.

489
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:22,282
If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid.

490
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:24,486
The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend.

491
00:43:24,486 --> 00:43:26,113
- We stay here. - And then?

492
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:27,846
We wait for them to come to us.

493
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,082
Then we fight them.

494
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,322
Clegane.

495
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,015
What the fuck you doing here?

496
00:44:44,193 --> 00:44:46,637
Chasing them. You?

497
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:50,255
Hanging them. Any particular reason?

498
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,380
They're our men. Or they were.

499
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:55,491
They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers.

500
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:57,864
Why do you want them? Same reason.

501
00:44:58,468 --> 00:44:59,828
I was helping build it.

502
00:45:00,895 --> 00:45:02,806
They killed a friend of mine.

503
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:04,024
You've got friends?

504
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:07,313
Not anymore. They're mine.

505
00:45:07,482 --> 00:45:09,769
It's the Brotherhood's good name they've dragged through the dirt.

506
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,455
Fuck your name. They're mine.

507
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:13,002
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

508
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,522
Happy to do it again.

509
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:17,144
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

510
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:21,215
Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.

511
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:24,922
You can have one of them.

512
00:45:30,068 --> 00:45:30,940
Two.

513
00:45:42,762 --> 00:45:44,202
No, no, no.

514
00:45:45,268 --> 00:45:47,606
We're not butchers. We hang them.

515
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,700
Hanging?

516
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:50,993
All over in an instant.

517
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:52,557
Where's the punishment in that?

518
00:45:52,557 --> 00:45:54,868
- They die. - We all bloody die.

519
00:45:54,868 --> 00:45:56,380
Except this one here.

520
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,544
I'll only gut one of them.

521
00:45:59,695 --> 00:46:00,504
No.

522
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:04,131
I'll chop off one hand.

523
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:07,313
We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss.

524
00:46:07,553 --> 00:46:08,735
That's generous.

525
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:14,468
Bunch of nancies.

526
00:46:16,157 --> 00:46:18,157
There was a time I would have killed all seven of you

527
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:19,606
just to gut these three.

528
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:21,188
You're getting old, Clegane.

529
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,317
He's not.

530
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:27,482
Please don't. I'll give you anything.

531
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:57,330
Got anything to eat?

532
00:47:09,891 --> 00:47:11,206
Enjoying yourself?

533
00:47:12,468 --> 00:47:14,042
I prefer chicken.

534
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:19,108
You ought to join us. We could use you.

535
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,780
I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.

536
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,313
Clegane, we're here for a reason.

537
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:30,771
The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason.

538
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:35,820
He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason.

539
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:39,002
We are part of something larger than ourselves.

540
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:44,042
Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.

541
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:53,597
Cold winds are rising in the North.

542
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:56,122
And you're going to go stop them?

543
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,384
We need good men to help us.

544
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,064
Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.

545
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:05,704
True enough.

546
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:09,300
But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me.

547
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,904
Why?

548
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:14,602
I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric.

549
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:19,375
I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord

550
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:21,811
and I'm better than you now.

551
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,335
Aye, you're probably right.

552
00:48:25,393 --> 00:48:26,504
You're a fighter.

553
00:48:27,553 --> 00:48:29,508
You were born a fighter.

554
00:48:30,122 --> 00:48:31,784
You walked away from the fight.

555
00:48:32,628 --> 00:48:33,760
How did that go?

556
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,580
Good and bad, young and old,

557
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:43,091
the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike.

558
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:47,971
You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.

559
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:49,780
It's not too late for you.

560
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:54,948
Lady Crane?

561
00:50:03,891 --> 00:50:04,877
Lady Crane?

562
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,953
If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly.

563
00:50:18,086 --> 00:50:19,215
Instead...

564
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,400
The Many-Faced God was promised a name.

565
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,291
He must always receive what is his.

566
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:30,415
You can't change that.

567
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:33,286
I can't change that.

568
00:50:33,953 --> 00:50:35,064
No one can.

569
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,490
And now he's been promised another name.

570
00:50:56,326 --> 00:50:58,122
- Hey! - Get out!

571
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:02,202
Yah!

572
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,820
Yah!

573
00:52:43,686 --> 00:52:45,331
My basket!

574
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,713
It will all be over soon.

575
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:26,042
On your knees or on your feet?

576
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,842
Haven't we been through this already?

577
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,468
That won't help you.

578
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,157
You told her to kill me.

579
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:04,810
Yes.

580
00:56:05,935 --> 00:56:07,073
But here you are.

581
00:56:08,673 --> 00:56:10,180
And there she is.

582
00:56:20,913 --> 00:56:23,002
Finally a girl is no one.

583
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:32,522
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
