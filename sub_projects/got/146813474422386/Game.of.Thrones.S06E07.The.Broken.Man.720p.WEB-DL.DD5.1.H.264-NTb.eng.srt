1
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,266
That's it. Get it right to the top.

2
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,711
Steady. Steady.

3
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:49,120
Up she goes.

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,733
Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?

5
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:53,911
Here you are, son.

6
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:59,368
- Oh, gentlemen, please. - To my right.

7
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:03,680
And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on.


11
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:52,408
In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that.

12
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,742
How many men did it take to cut you down?

13
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:57,991
Just one.

14
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,062
He must have been some kind of monster.

15
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,297
He was a woman.

16
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:49,564
I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.

17
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,893
I'm used to it.

18
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,364
When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days.

19
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,368
The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you

20
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,840
and bone was coming through right there.

21
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,902
I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed.

22
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,653
Oh, nearly shit myself.

23
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:16,702
I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't.

24
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:19,804
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days,

25
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:22,110
but you didn't. What kept you going?

26
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,250
Hate.

27
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,822
No, there's a reason you're still here.

28
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:34,497
Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.

29
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:35,937
No, a reason.

30
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,573
Gods aren't done with you yet.

31
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,111
I've heard that before.

32
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,946
Man was talking about a different god, though. Well, maybe he was right.

33
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:52,373
I don't know much about the gods. You're in the wrong line of work.

34
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:56,897
Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods.

35
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:59,866
I don't. I don't even know their real names.

36
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:03,555
Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods.

37
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:08,631
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing.

38
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,911
I don't know.

39
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:15,217
What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us.

40
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:20,008
And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.

41
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:26,382
You didn't know me back in my time.

42
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,320
You don't know the things I've done.

43
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,760
I've heard stories.

44
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,617
If the gods are real...

45
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:41,982
why haven't they punished me?

46
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,035
They have.

47
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:02,657
Your Grace.

48
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,591
What are we reading today?

49
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:08,604
The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.

50
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:10,631
Chapter three, verse 12.

51
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:14,711
Ah, "As water rounds the stones, smoothing--"

52
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:21,200
"Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature.

53
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:26,311
A wife salves her husband's wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep."

54
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,480
You learn quickly.

55
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:33,240
There are some who know every verse of the sacred text,

56
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,817
but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood

57
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:42,364
and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom.

58
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:50,186
For years I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted.

59
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,500
I had pity for them, but I never loved them.

60
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:56,915
They disgusted me.

61
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,902
They are hard to love.

62
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:04,995
The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions.

63
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:09,173
They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes.

64
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:11,235
How'd we smell without perfume.

65
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,808
Can I ask you about a personal matter? Of course.

66
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:27,573
The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.

67
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:32,444
No. You have a duty, Your Grace.

68
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:38,328
To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.

69
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,213
It's just...

70
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:45,333
the desires that once drove me no longer do.

71
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:52,702
Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience.

72
00:08:54,071 --> 00:08:59,031
The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.

73
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:04,728
Forgive me. Sometimes the true path is hard to find.

74
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:09,342
Hard to find and harder still to walk upon.

75
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:12,551
But you've made great progress.

76
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,466
I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.

77
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:23,253
My grandmother? Yes.

78
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,528
The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman,

79
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:30,231
and an unrepentant sinner.

80
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:34,764
You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old.

81
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:39,235
Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.

82
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:49,768
Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.

83
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,880
Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.

84
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,031
Oh, this is madness!

85
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,949
You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear.

86
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,826
All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...

87
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:11,262
- Grandmother. - ...until I tell them to stop.

88
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,315
If I tell them to stop.

89
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:17,075
- You could use a good bashing. - Grandmother, please.

90
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,453
What have they done to you?

91
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:22,551
You marched against the High Sparrow, - against the Faith. - We marched for you.

92
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:25,360
The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't.

93
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,191
- They showed mercy. - And what about your brother?

94
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:33,271
What mercy did they show him? Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent.

95
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,497
If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden.

96
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,791
He'll have to renounce his name and title...

97
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,431
- Have you lost your mind? - ...and live his life as a penitent.

98
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:45,084
He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.

99
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:48,240
He can begin again. As a mindless fanatic.

100
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,070
As a free man.

101
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,893
You will leave for Highgarden today.

102
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,560
There is no law that says you must stay here.

103
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,537
I am the queen.

104
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,244
It is my duty to serve my husband the king.

105
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:09,182
But you should leave, Grandmother.

106
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:11,164
Your place is at home.

107
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:14,382
I will never leave you. Never.

108
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,484
You must.

109
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,982
Go home.

110
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:24,195
Find comfort in prayer and good works.

111
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:29,226
The Mother watches over us all.

112
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:38,360
I'll see you soon, my dear.

113
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,657
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

114
00:11:58,346 --> 00:11:59,475
Shall we pray?

115
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:18,906
We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,

116
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:23,235
when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to.

117
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,613
These aren't white walkers. This isn't an army of the dead.

118
00:12:26,977 --> 00:12:28,968
This isn't our fight.

119
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:33,066
If it weren't for him, none of us would be here.

120
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:36,631
All of you would be meat in the Night King's army.

121
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:39,875
And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.

122
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,346
Remember Mance's camp?

123
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,604
It stretched all the way to the horizon.

124
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,275
And look at us now.

125
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:48,462
Look what's left of us.

126
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,080
And if we lose this, we're gone.

127
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:56,560
Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.

128
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:58,770
Be like we were never there at all.

129
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:01,173
We'll be the last of the free folk.

130
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,480
That's what'll happen to you if we lose.

131
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,026
The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here.

132
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:15,173
They know that more than half of you are women and children.

133
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:17,617
After they finish with me, they'll come for you.

134
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:20,231
You're right.

135
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,835
This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me.

136
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:28,257
I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made.

137
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:32,382
I need you with me if we're going to beat them,

138
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:35,271
and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.

139
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:45,902
The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would.

140
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:48,453
He died for us.

141
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:54,000
If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards.

142
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,528
And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.

143
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:17,680
Snow.

144
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,622
Are you sure they'll come?

145
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,684
We're not clever like you southerners.

146
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:10,204
When we say we'll do something, we do it.

147
00:15:27,688 --> 00:15:29,564
I heard you were leaving King's Landing.

148
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:35,831
That is hardly your concern. Your grandson is still a prisoner.

149
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:40,800
You'll leave him rotting in a cell? Loras rots in a cell because of you.

150
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,640
The High Sparrow rules this city because of you.

151
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,880
Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.

152
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:53,644
You're right.

153
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,800
I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.

154
00:15:59,457 --> 00:16:03,440
Good. I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep.

155
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:06,060
And now we must fight them together.

156
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:10,124
We need each other.

157
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:15,830
I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.

158
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,657
At a certain age, it's hard to recall.

159
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,440
But the truly vile do stand out through the years.

160
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,982
Do you remember the way you smirked at me

161
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:29,650
when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?

162
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,631
I do. I'll never forget it.

163
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:34,444
You love your granddaughter.

164
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,164
I love my son.

165
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:39,831
It's the only truth I know.

166
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:42,311
We must defend them.

167
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,648
I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can

168
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:50,782
before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells.

169
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,639
If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find a way out of here, too.

170
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,520
Never.

171
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:59,680
I'll never leave my son. What'll you do, then?

172
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:02,924
You have no support. Not anymore.

173
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:06,355
Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that.

174
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:11,075
The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you.

175
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,715
You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them.

176
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,840
You're going to kill them all by yourself?

177
00:17:17,306 --> 00:17:18,693
You've lost, Cersei.

178
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,382
It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.

179
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,964
Pick the pace up.

180
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:34,310
Keep going.

181
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:40,088
Keep it moving!

182
00:18:16,382 --> 00:18:18,968
Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.

183
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:22,311
Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.

184
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,488
Someone certainly does.

185
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:28,062
Oh, no. Not me.

186
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:29,946
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

187
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:32,622
You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.

188
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:34,648
Aye, knights don't get paid.

189
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:37,537
You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.

190
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:42,337
That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.

191
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,782
I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long.

192
00:18:47,688 --> 00:18:49,511
You can be the right hand I lost.

193
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:58,408
You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.

194
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:00,880
And you'll get all three. A Lannister always--

195
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

196
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:24,808
Come out and fight us, Blackfish.

197
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,222
We have Lord Edmure.

198
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,720
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

199
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:56,426
This is your last warning. Yield the castle.

200
00:20:08,426 --> 00:20:10,280
You think I won't do it, old man?

201
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,248
I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear.

202
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,830
And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward.

203
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:26,711
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

204
00:20:36,622 --> 00:20:39,422
Go on, then. Cut his throat.

205
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,577
Lothar, is it?

206
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:05,360
Ser Jaime.

207
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,555
We didn't know you were coming. 'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter.

208
00:21:09,555 --> 00:21:12,960
You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.

209
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,449
Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.

210
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,293
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

211
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:21,653
Walder.

212
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:27,173
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

213
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,755
Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out.

214
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:38,515
Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking.

215
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,040
- What do you think I'd do? - I don't give a rat's--

216
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:46,044
I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle.

217
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,160
Have him bathed and fed.

218
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,497
Unless you'd like to take his place.

219
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,333
Apologies, Ser Jaime. Do as he says.

220
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,848
The siege is now under my command.

221
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,586
The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts,

222
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,991
he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.

223
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:07,688
Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards.

224
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:10,328
And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.

225
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:14,515
Those are our siege towers-- As I said, the siege is under my command.

226
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:16,897
If that's not to your liking, go home.

227
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:25,208
Get word to the Blackfish.

228
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,020
I want a parley. A parley or a fight?

229
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:33,804
He's an old man. You've got one hand.

230
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:35,920
My money's on the old boy.

231
00:22:55,937 --> 00:23:00,408
Lady Mormont. Welcome to Bear Island.

232
00:23:07,902 --> 00:23:11,822
I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.

233
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,515
It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.

234
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:18,702
I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty.

235
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:20,462
She was a great warrior, though.

236
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:22,542
She died fighting for your brother Robb.

237
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:30,240
I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

238
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,800
He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact--

239
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,928
I think we've had enough small talk. Why are you here?

240
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:45,715
Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed.

241
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:48,666
He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men.

242
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,604
- It said-- - I remember what it said.

243
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:54,910
Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.

244
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:01,377
Robb is gone, but House Stark is not.

245
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:04,408
And it needs your support now more than ever.

246
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:08,364
I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.

247
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:23,777
As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

248
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:25,431
Or is she a Lannister?

249
00:24:26,177 --> 00:24:27,980
I've heard conflicting reports.

250
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:31,306
I did what I had to do to survive, my lady.

251
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:34,328
But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.

252
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:39,795
If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.

253
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:44,631
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him.

254
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:48,400
Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

255
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:53,511
What you have to understand, my lady, is that--

256
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:57,324
I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here.

257
00:24:57,484 --> 00:25:01,706
So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?

258
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,182
If it please, my lady,

259
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:12,390
I understand how you feel.

260
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,315
I don't know you, Ser...?

261
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:17,440
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

262
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:19,653
You needn't ask your maester about my house.

263
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,093
It's rather new.

264
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:28,702
All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?

265
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:32,355
You never thought you'd find yourself in your position.

266
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:36,780
Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age.

267
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:42,088
I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler.

268
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:47,066
And now I find myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war.

269
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,875
But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war.

270
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:54,240
It's our war.

271
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,008
Go on, Ser Davos.

272
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:04,340
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward.

273
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:09,340
He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew he had the courage to do what was right,

274
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:11,893
even if it meant giving his life.

275
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:16,595
Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood

276
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:19,964
that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.

277
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,420
It's between the living and the dead.

278
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:29,004
And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.

279
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,960
Is this true?

280
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,733
Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men.

281
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:41,697
I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.

282
00:26:43,306 --> 00:26:46,650
As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided.

283
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:50,657
And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King.

284
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:55,146
You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand.

285
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:57,004
But there's no hiding from this.

286
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,457
We have to fight and we need to do it together.

287
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:16,266
House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years.

288
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:21,380
We will not break faith today.

289
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,435
Thank you, my lady.

290
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,626
How many fighting men can we expect?

291
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:39,608
62.

292
00:27:43,315 --> 00:27:47,413
- 62? - We are not a large house, but we're a proud one.

293
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:51,822
And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.

294
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:56,853
If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.

295
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:15,111
Kingslayer.

296
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:17,715
Blackfish.

297
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:23,128
I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

298
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:26,008
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

299
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:28,302
- I don't have them. - Pity.

300
00:29:29,484 --> 00:29:31,928
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

301
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:36,000
Then why are you here? You know why I'm here.

302
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:39,813
This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing.

303
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,711
In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or--

304
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:44,942
Or you'll kill Edmure?

305
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:49,253
My nephew's marked for death no matter what.

306
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,435
Hang him and be done with it. It won't stop with Edmure.

307
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:55,848
You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.

308
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,195
Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.

309
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,426
If you can breach the walls.

310
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:06,746
We'll breach them and kill every last one of you.

311
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:09,742
But if you surrender,

312
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:12,391
I'll spare the lives of your men.

313
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:15,982
On my honor. Your honor?

314
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:19,582
Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.

315
00:30:19,582 --> 00:30:24,435
The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?

316
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:34,008
As long as I'm standing, the war is not over.

317
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:36,488
This is my home.

318
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,640
I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it.

319
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:43,084
So you can either attack

320
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:46,222
or try to starve us out.

321
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:49,590
We have enough provisions for two years.

322
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:54,968
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

323
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:03,528
You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives.

324
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:05,466
Why did you come treat with me?

325
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,115
Sieges are dull.

326
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:12,150
And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.

327
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:17,048
Well, now you have. Aye, now I have.

328
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,448
I'm disappointed.

329
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:31,271
The answer is no.

330
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:33,822
- Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out. - I've heard enough.

331
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:37,208
We've only just taken back this castle from the ironborn.

332
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,970
The Boltons helped us do it.

333
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:43,271
Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.

334
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:45,502
The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton--

335
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:48,613
Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?

336
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:50,897
House Mormont.

337
00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:53,395
And?

338
00:31:54,577 --> 00:31:56,017
We sent ravens to Houses Manderly--

339
00:31:56,017 --> 00:31:57,804
I don't care about ravens.

340
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:01,493
You're asking me to join your army.

341
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:04,497
Who is fighting in this army?

342
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,640
The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.

343
00:32:16,222 --> 00:32:17,493
Then the rumors are true.

344
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,871
I didn't dare believe them.

345
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:28,080
I received you out of respect for your father.

346
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:30,284
Now I would like you to leave.

347
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,400
House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.

348
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:40,560
- Lord Glover. - There's nothing else to say.

349
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,711
I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark.

350
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:47,493
Sworn to answer when called upon.

351
00:32:57,786 --> 00:33:01,662
Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries.

352
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:04,968
We wept when we heard of your father's death.

353
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:09,262
When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call

354
00:33:09,262 --> 00:33:11,600
and hailed him King in the North.

355
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:21,724
And where was King Robb when the ironborn attacked this castle?

356
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:25,644
When they threw my wife and children in prison

357
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:29,057
and brutalized and killed our subjects?

358
00:33:30,604 --> 00:33:33,128
Taking up with a foreign whore.

359
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,466
Getting himself and those who followed him killed.

360
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:47,040
I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.

361
00:34:45,937 --> 00:34:47,306
Why did we have to come here?

362
00:34:48,231 --> 00:34:50,142
Some of us still like it.

363
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:57,528
Have a drink at least. I don't want one.

364
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,315
Don't go far, love.

365
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:04,568
I'll find you in a bit.

366
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:12,853
Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that.

367
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:15,964
Doesn't interest you anymore?

368
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:21,831
I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.

369
00:35:24,026 --> 00:35:25,751
I'll never hurt you, little brother.

370
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:27,422
Don't you know that?

371
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,520
You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?

372
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,084
Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat.

373
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,600
He'll find us. It's a great big world and we have fast ships.

374
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:44,520
Drink. I don't want any.

375
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,657
I don't care what you want. Drink.

376
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:50,880
Drink it all.

377
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,257
You're ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years.

378
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,253
Some bad years?

379
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:02,302
But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog.

380
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:04,444
Drink the goddamn ale.

381
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:10,195
Now listen to me.

382
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,320
I need you.

383
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:16,106
The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender.

384
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:17,620
Can you find him for me?

385
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,320
Drink.

386
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,248
You escaped. You hear me?

387
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:26,986
You got away and you're never going back.

388
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,666
We'll get justice for you.

389
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:31,484
If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.

390
00:36:31,484 --> 00:36:34,284
Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink.

391
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:40,142
Listen to me.

392
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:46,808
If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists.

393
00:36:47,813 --> 00:36:48,808
End it.

394
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,537
But if you're staying, Theon, I need you.

395
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:56,320
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

396
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:59,511
We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen.

397
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,830
And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.

398
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,746
Are you with me?

399
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,480
Are you really with me?

400
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,488
Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while,

401
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:34,702
I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.

402
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:49,182
Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.

403
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:51,502
And that's a good thing?

404
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:55,448
He was the most experienced commander in Westeros.

405
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,555
He chose this place for a reason.

406
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:00,542
Those mountains are a natural fortification.

407
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,462
There's a stream down there for the horses.

408
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:06,017
We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day.

409
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:10,382
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.

410
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:14,293
We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.

411
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:16,977
2,000 wildlings,

412
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,106
200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins--

413
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:21,964
62 Mormonts.

414
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:24,417
It's not what we'd hoped for.

415
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:29,964
But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.

416
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:33,786
For fuck's sake.

417
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:39,706
So he's your most trusted advisor now?

418
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:43,502
Because he secured 62 men from a 10-year-old?

419
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:48,373
Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.

420
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,057
Stannis who lost the Blackwater,

421
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:53,920
who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?

422
00:38:54,702 --> 00:38:57,724
It's not enough. We need more men.

423
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,213
There's no time.

424
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,560
If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord--

425
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,924
We fight with the army we have.

426
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:10,231
Friends, this is not worth fighting over!

427
00:39:12,408 --> 00:39:13,530
This'll be it, now.

428
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,422
Right, now we don't need to be fighting--

429
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,582
- Who the fuck are you? - Hold on.

430
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:19,084
Yeah, who the fuck are you?

431
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:06,595
I was a soldier once.

432
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:09,546
All my superiors thought I was brave.

433
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,995
I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight.

434
00:40:13,253 --> 00:40:16,462
Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid.

435
00:40:16,462 --> 00:40:18,284
That's all I was, a coward.

436
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:22,488
We followed orders no matter the orders.

437
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:24,355
Burn that village.

438
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:27,448
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

439
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,462
Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief.

440
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:34,008
Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us.

441
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:37,120
I'm your murderer.

442
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:41,520
I remember once a woman screaming at us,

443
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,862
calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut.

444
00:40:46,017 --> 00:40:47,484
But we weren't animals.

445
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:53,031
Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours.

446
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:58,702
I cut that young boy's throat myself

447
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:02,951
as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.

448
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,226
That night...

449
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:11,546
I felt such shame.

450
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,960
Shame was so heavy on me,

451
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,062
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

452
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,680
All I could do was stare into that dark sky

453
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:24,888
and listen to that mother screaming her son's name.

454
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,093
I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.

455
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:39,751
Now, I know I can never bring that lad back.

456
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:44,897
All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world.

457
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:46,711
That's all any of us can do, isn't it?

458
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,120
Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people.

459
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:52,951
Start helping people.

460
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,453
It's never too late to come back.

461
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:14,791
And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers.

462
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,697
It's not even about the gods. It's about you.

463
00:42:18,693 --> 00:42:21,395
Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.

464
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:26,515
Seven save you, friends.

465
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:29,626
How can we help you?

466
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:34,613
What are you doing here?

467
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,271
Well, we're talking about life.

468
00:42:38,311 --> 00:42:41,182
You? Protecting the people.

469
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,813
Well, we thank you for your protection.

470
00:42:45,155 --> 00:42:46,906
Who are you protecting us from?

471
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,093
Do you have any horses? No horses.

472
00:42:53,386 --> 00:42:55,813
No gold. No steel.

473
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:59,964
Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.

474
00:42:59,964 --> 00:43:01,235
I'm sure it is.

475
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:05,804
You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here.

476
00:43:13,804 --> 00:43:14,924
Stay safe.

477
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,320
The night is dark and full of terrors.

478
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:44,426
"Seven save you, friends."

479
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:48,179
I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?

480
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,493
They don't believe in your Seven.

481
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,017
They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.

482
00:43:52,017 --> 00:43:53,573
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

483
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,142
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

484
00:43:56,142 --> 00:44:00,088
Sure, you do. You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't.

485
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:02,062
And you've got women.

486
00:44:02,062 --> 00:44:04,462
What do you want to do? Fight them?

487
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,875
Kill them? It'd be you against all of them.

488
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:11,902
I mean, these people don't know how to fight. You do.

489
00:44:12,391 --> 00:44:14,168
I'm done with fighting.

490
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:16,355
Even if it's to protect yourself?

491
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:18,906
Violence is a disease.

492
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:22,693
You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.

493
00:44:23,857 --> 00:44:26,080
You don't cure it by dying, either.

494
00:44:28,391 --> 00:44:31,217
You've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.

495
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:34,800
It's gonna be a cold night.

496
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,657
We'll need firewood.

497
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,915
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

498
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:41,964
Might even have some ale hidden away.

499
00:44:50,373 --> 00:44:54,160
He's not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay.

500
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,791
I'm inclined to believe him. I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.

501
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:01,866
You're Westerosi. What do you care?

502
00:45:02,462 --> 00:45:03,911
I want to book passage home.

503
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:07,573
You? Can't afford it.

504
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,493
Where'd you steal this from? Why do you care?

505
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:20,515
We leave in two days.

506
00:45:21,182 --> 00:45:22,906
You can have a hammock in steerage.

507
00:45:25,386 --> 00:45:28,257
I want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.

508
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:31,448
See you at sunrise.

509
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,035
Sweet girl.
