
4
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,071
Where you gonna go?

5
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:23,235
South. What are you gonna do?

6
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:25,866
Get warm.

7
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,457
I was with you at Hardhome.

8
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:38,568
We saw what's out there.

9
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:43,182
We know it's coming here. How can you leave us now?

10
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:46,373
I did everything I could. You know that.

11
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:49,680
You swore a vow. Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

12
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,635
- I gave my life. - For all nights to come.

13
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:54,000
They killed me, Edd! My own brothers.

14
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:59,244
You want me to stay here after that? Riders approaching!

15
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:01,075
Open the gate!

16
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,888
This is good soup.

17
00:04:40,168 --> 00:04:42,737
Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?

18
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:44,800
- With the peas and onions? - Mmm.

19
00:04:48,586 --> 00:04:50,408
We never should have left Winterfell.

20
00:04:51,564 --> 00:04:53,991
Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left?

21
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,395
I want to scream at myself, "Don't go, you idiot."

22
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,004
How could we know?

23
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:06,106
I spent a lot of time thinking about what an ass I was to you.

24
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,275
I wish I could change everything.

25
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:13,608
We were children. I was awful, just admit it.

26
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,075
You were occasionally awful.

27
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,560
I'm sure I can't have been great fun. Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played.

28
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,542
- Can you forgive me? - There's nothing to forgive.

29
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:25,902
- Forgive me. - All right.

30
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,168
All right, I forgive you.

31
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:50,373
You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale.

32
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:55,208
Where will you go?

33
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:58,284
Where will we go?

34
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,022
If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me.

35
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,964
Where will we go? I can't stay here, not after what happened.

36
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:14,222
There's only one place we can go. Home.

37
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:19,386
Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave? We'll take it back from them.

38
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,408
I don't have an army. How many wildlings did you save?

39
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:29,848
They didn't come here to serve me. They owe you their lives.

40
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:33,413
You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?

41
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:35,466
- Sansa. - Winterfell is our home.

42
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,484
It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's.

43
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,680
Wherever they are, it belongs to our family.

44
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:44,871
We have to fight for it. I'm tired of fighting.

45
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,231
It's all I've done since I left home. I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch.

46
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:54,986
I've killed wildlings. I've killed men that I admire.

47
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:58,337
I hanged a boy younger than Bran.

48
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:05,377
I fought and I lost.

49
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,840
If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe.

50
00:07:14,462 --> 00:07:16,231
I want you to help me.

51
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,337
But I'll do it myself if I have to.

52
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,004
My lady.

53
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,106
Ser Davos.

54
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,382
Will you stay here at Castle Black?

55
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:36,346
I will do as Jon Snow commands.

56
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,093
You serve Jon Snow now?

57
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,755
He's the prince that was promised.

58
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,075
Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis.

59
00:07:57,848 --> 00:07:59,137
What happened down there?

60
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,506
There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.

61
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:07,520
And Shireen?

62
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,115
What happened to the princess? I saw what happened.

63
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:16,151
I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field.

64
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,093
My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth. We've met before.

65
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:22,080
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

66
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,973
Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.

67
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:28,835
That's in the past now.

68
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:34,800
Yes, it's in the past. It doesn't mean I forget.

69
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,626
Or forgive.

70
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:42,933
He admitted it, you know. Who did?

71
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,346
Stannis.

72
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,280
Just before I executed him.

73
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:35,333
The Defender of the Vale!

74
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:36,666
Uncle Petyr!

75
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:47,084
My lord. Come and see.

76
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,608
I missed your name day. Go on.

77
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,062
A falcon!

78
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:58,080
A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.

79
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,542
Last time I saw you, Baelish,

80
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:04,689
you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.

81
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,857
Indeed I was.

82
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:11,760
And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

83
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,582
On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men.

84
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:19,768
Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting.

85
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:21,306
Do you take me for a fool?

86
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:28,337
Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?

87
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,657
I shared my intentions with you and no one else.

88
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:37,306
Slander a man in his own home,

89
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,075
you might find yourself crossing swords with him.

90
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:45,128
Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us.

91
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:47,760
And only his judgment concerns me.

92
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,520
Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?

93
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:04,080
My lord.

94
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:09,884
My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn.

95
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,968
To your father, to your mother, and now to you.

96
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,920
Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?

97
00:11:24,177 --> 00:11:26,213
Lord Royce has served the Vale well.

98
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,328
He's enjoyed a distinguished military career.

99
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,777
If we could trust his absolute loyalty,

100
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,546
he would make a capable commander in the wars to come.

101
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,408
You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord.

102
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:47,410
I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?

103
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,520
Fine.

104
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:05,102
I bring good news.

105
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:08,240
My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

106
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,893
I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander.

107
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:16,506
But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her.

108
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,328
She's my cousin.

109
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:26,551
We should help her. That was my instinct as well.

110
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:29,990
Our lord has spoken.

111
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:36,017
Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.

112
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,608
You invite the enemy into our city? I did.

113
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,235
As a clever man once told me,

114
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:50,302
"We make peace with our enemies, not our friends."

115
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,648
I don't make peace with the queen's enemies.

116
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:55,866
I kill the queen's enemies. Yes, that's the military approach.

117
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:59,946
And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach.

118
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,697
Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.

119
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:07,688
We enter these negotiations with open eyes.

120
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:12,595
Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution.

121
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:16,248
How many days were you a slave? Long enough to know.

122
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:19,004
Not long enough to understand.

123
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,595
I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor.

124
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:34,391
And somehow you've risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

125
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,253
It's most impressive. And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.

126
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,786
Here's to reversals of fortune.

127
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:46,408
We came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.

128
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,257
Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want.

129
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:52,435
We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.

130
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,031
Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.

131
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,404
Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.

132
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:07,866
When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them.

133
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:12,195
She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains.

134
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:14,675
As they have since the dawn of time.

135
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:17,386
- Not anymore. - You think you're a free man now?

136
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,715
You still follow orders.

137
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,346
Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master.

138
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:27,537
Friends, friends, friends, please.

139
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,711
There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing.

140
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,448
That is the way of the world. I'm not here to change the way of the world.

141
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:37,937
Slavery is the way of our world.

142
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,360
You don't need slaves to make money.

143
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:46,666
There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you.

144
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,044
But our queen recognizes that she erred

145
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:58,020
by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it.

146
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,711
So here is the queen's proposal.

147
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,400
Slavery will never return to Meereen,

148
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:09,902
but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order.

149
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,226
What does that mean?

150
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,608
Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice.

151
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,862
Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices.

152
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:31,288
In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy.

153
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:36,390
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy. Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.

154
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:42,142
I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer.

155
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:50,764
Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it.

156
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:55,520
And as a parting gift to our honored guests...

157
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,080
Give freedom a chance.

158
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:09,502
See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before.

159
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:22,701
MY FRIENDS!

160
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:26,080
LARGE SORRY...

161
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,916
...YOU WAIT SO FAT TIME.

162
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:34,487
Perhaps I should translate for you. We speak the Common Tongue.

163
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,177
- Excellent. - You met with the slavers today.

164
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:41,875
I did. Our brothers and sisters died fighting this scum.

165
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,417
Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.

166
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:51,003
I imagine this room was built

167
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,724
so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.

168
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,217
But I am not your ruler.

169
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,420
I'm not the Breaker of Chains.

170
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,071
I'm not the Unburnt.

171
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,222
And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.

172
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:09,262
You are a stranger here.

173
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:12,222
So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?

174
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:15,040
Because our queen chose me as her advisor.

175
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,217
Until she returns from her travels-- When does she return?

176
00:17:19,217 --> 00:17:21,964
Soon. You have my word.

177
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:25,724
We don't know you. We don't trust you. We know Torgo Nudho.

178
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:28,106
We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.

179
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:31,733
And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations.

180
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:37,559
As commander of the Unsullied, he knows how to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace.

181
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,733
You have made peace with the slavers? We offered terms.

182
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,908
AND YOU,GREY WORM?

183
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,868
YOU WANT TO DRINK...

184
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:50,873
THE MEN WHO TORE US FROM...

185
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,256
I AM A SOLDIER,...

186
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:01,592
BUT IF THERE IS A...

187
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,260
A JUST PEACE

188
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:05,137
WE SHOULD TAKE IT.

189
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:07,431
MISSANDEI,

190
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:11,685
YOU KONW WHAT THESE MEN ARE....

191
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:15,147
I DO NOT TRUST THEM....

192
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:23,113
BUT AS A WISE MAN...

193
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:29,662
"WE MAKE PEACE WITH OUR..."

194
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:37,660
- Do not use me for your lies. - Those men respect you.

195
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:40,020
They respect me because they know who I am.

196
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:42,080
- They know I am loyal. - As do I.

197
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,640
I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy.

198
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,733
I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.

199
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:53,280
You promised the slavers they could keep slavery. For a short time.

200
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,680
Seven years is not a short time for a slave. You're right.

201
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:00,382
Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once.

202
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:02,977
War is a horror that should be ended at once.

203
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:06,444
I can't do both today. You are wrong to trust these men.

204
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:10,115
I don't trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest.

205
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:13,928
They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.

206
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:19,004
You don't know them. You don't understand them. We are not human in their eyes.

207
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:22,924
They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.

208
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:28,426
They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness.

209
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:32,071
They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.

210
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,053
You will not use them.

211
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,520
They will use you. That is what they do.

212
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,577
You all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?

213
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,942
I'm fine.

214
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,604
I don't think you could ride the dragon.

215
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,426
20 years ago, maybe.

216
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,706
- What? - Our queen.

217
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:17,324
She's wild, you know. Don't let her size fool you.

218
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,795
It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man.

219
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:23,902
You, I don't think your heart could take it.

220
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,240
Must make you angry that our queen chose me.

221
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,351
Makes me sad. You'll disappoint her before long.

222
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:36,071
- She'll move on. - We'll all disappoint her before long.

223
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:38,960
We need each other right now. After we're done needing each other--

224
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,231
Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal.

225
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:47,030
What do I have to gain? If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man.

226
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,786
If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man.

227
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:56,560
You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you? None.

228
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:07,280
The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway.

229
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,088
Eastern Market, Western Market.

230
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,470
When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,

231
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:16,586
the widows of the dead khals.

232
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:22,337
That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

233
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:35,813
What are you doing? It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.

234
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:38,960
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?

235
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,564
If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market.

236
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:47,315
But if they see weapons... You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth.

237
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:49,395
There's 100,000 of them down there.

238
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:53,591
We can't fight our way out. We wait till dark, and then we'll find her.

239
00:22:03,484 --> 00:22:06,711
I'm very attached to this knife.

240
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:20,044
Don't worry. It didn't touch you.

241
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:24,942
You know what happens? I know what happens.

242
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:29,155
I'll do it myself.

243
00:23:02,693 --> 00:23:04,373
I should have been born a Dothraki.

244
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:32,820
Come on.

245
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:36,927
MY FRIENDS...

246
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:41,056
WE WANDERED OFF...

247
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,268
COULD YOU SHOW...

248
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:45,602
WHAT DO YOU SELL?

249
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:46,728
WINE.

250
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:49,189
COME DOWN TO...

251
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:52,901
I'LL GIVE YOU A ...

252
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:00,117
YOU'RE NOT MERCHANTS.

253
00:24:00,117 --> 00:24:01,451
GET THE OTHERS.

254
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:55,777
Told you, I'm very attached to this knife.

255
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:57,804
You all right?

256
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,933
If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us.

257
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:36,213
SOME OF THEM...

258
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:41,510
THEY ARE STUPID...

259
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,428
THIS ONE IS...

260
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:46,682
HER KHAL FOUND...

261
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,017
HOW OLD WERE YOU?

262
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:51,603
TWELVE.

263
00:25:52,062 --> 00:25:56,316
A YEAR LATER,...

264
00:25:56,608 --> 00:25:58,985
HE BROKE MY RIBS.

265
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:05,367
WE ARE NOT...

266
00:26:05,867 --> 00:26:07,661
OUR LIVES HAVE MEANING.

267
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:10,580
THAT IS MORE THAN...

268
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:16,712
WHEN THE KHALS MEET...

269
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:20,215
THE OTHER ...

270
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,009
I NEED TO...

271
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:26,930
YOU CAN'T RUN...

272
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,724
YOU KNOW THIS.

273
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:31,393
I WILL NEVER RUN...

274
00:26:33,228 --> 00:26:34,438
GO,SHOW HER.

275
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:38,024
I NEEDED FRESH AIR.

276
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,068
THE OLD WOMEN STINK.

277
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:41,987
THEY DO STINK.

278
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:45,407
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN...

279
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:46,700
SIXTEEN.

280
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:49,995
TOO BAD HE...

281
00:26:51,997 --> 00:26:54,082
YES,TOO BAD.

282
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:56,543
IS IT TRUE YOU...

283
00:27:00,046 --> 00:27:02,007
AND THEY...

284
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:03,258
THEY DO.

285
00:27:03,675 --> 00:27:06,094
WOULD YOU LIKE...

286
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,597
I AM DOSH...

287
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:13,435
I CAN NEVER LEAVE ...

288
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,080
- No, don't hurt her. - She'll give us away.

289
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,493
We have to go now.

290
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:26,942
We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive. All we can do is try.

291
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,977
No.

292
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:34,017
We can do more than that. And you're going to help me.

293
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:38,376
AND YOU...

294
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:40,545
HAVE FAITH IN ME...

295
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:42,589
DO NOT...

296
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,600
If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go?

297
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:49,724
-  What would you seek out?

298
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,195
I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family.

299
00:28:56,222 --> 00:29:02,275
Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power.

300
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,284
Seeking out your family means seeking out sin.

301
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,484
I'm not maligning you. I sought those things out, too.

302
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,426
To the exclusion of all else.

303
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,964
My father was a cobbler.

304
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,217
He died when I was young and I took over his shop.

305
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,004
He was a simple man and he made simple shoes.

306
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:30,097
But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them.

307
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:33,030
Fine leather, ornamentation,

308
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:36,017
detailing, and time.

309
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:41,395
Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.

310
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:44,204
Quality takes time. Yes.

311
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,493
I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back.

312
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,475
The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege.

313
00:29:56,524 --> 00:30:00,524
I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself.

314
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,066
Each time I indulged,

315
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:07,210
I felt myself ascending to something better.

316
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,093
And one day you walked through a graveyard

317
00:30:09,093 --> 00:30:13,431
and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness.

318
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,115
Book of the Stranger, verse 25.

319
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:18,869
You know "The Seven-Pointed Star."

320
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,786
Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.

321
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,780
Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people.

322
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:28,711
You're close.

323
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:31,724
But it wasn't a graveyard.

324
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,520
It was a feast.

325
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:37,991
I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls

326
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,022
and invited my friends to come and share it all.

327
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:45,333
We passed around the wine, passed around the women,

328
00:30:45,813 --> 00:30:48,266
and soon we fell into a stupor.

329
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,431
I woke before dawn.

330
00:30:54,755 --> 00:30:56,257
I could barely stand.

331
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:01,457
Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor,

332
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:06,862
lying in heaps next to their fine clothes.

333
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:09,600
The truth of their bodies laid bare.

334
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:13,324
I could smell them

335
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:17,537
beneath the incense and the perfume

336
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,946
and the fine food that had already started to turn.

337
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,755
And I saw it with perfect clarity.

338
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,613
I saw what my sins were.

339
00:31:32,222 --> 00:31:35,244
The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used,

340
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:39,253
my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position.

341
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,982
It was all part of a story.

342
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,884
A story I was telling myself about who I was.

343
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:56,444
A collection of lies that would disappear in the light.

344
00:31:56,853 --> 00:31:59,608
The people I was trying to climb away from,

345
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,066
the beggars in the street, the poor,

346
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,604
they were closer to the truth than I ever was.

347
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:09,235
So what did you do?

348
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:15,004
I left to go and find them. I didn't even put on my shoes.

349
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:19,582
I walked out the door and never went back.

350
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:27,840
Come, let's go and see him.

351
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:30,444
- Who? - Your brother.

352
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,426
Loras.

353
00:32:55,102 --> 00:32:56,311
Loras.

354
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,031
Listen to me.

355
00:33:17,484 --> 00:33:19,870
You need to stay strong.

356
00:33:23,537 --> 00:33:25,066
I can't stay strong.

357
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,720
I never was strong. You are strong.

358
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,155
You are the future of our house, the future of our family.

359
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:35,688
- I don't care about that. - Shh!

360
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:40,213
Have you-- have you told them that?

361
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:45,795
That you don't care? I just want it to stop.

362
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:49,360
Help me.

363
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,360
They want me to help you.

364
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:03,235
They want me to help tear you down.

365
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:06,826
That's why he's letting me see you. I know it is.

366
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:10,373
And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.

367
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:12,204
Let them win.

368
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:17,546
Just make it stop. Please.

369
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:21,271
All right.

370
00:34:26,177 --> 00:34:30,275
And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament.

371
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:31,875
This High Sparrow.

372
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:35,280
I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace.

373
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,933
Not setting them off, that's the most important thing.

374
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,213
You are beset with enemies both within and without.

375
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,386
What are you doing here?

376
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:50,346
I am advising the king on our current predicament.

377
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:53,626
Leave. I am a member of the small council.

378
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:57,537
The king-- Is this a small council meeting?

379
00:34:57,537 --> 00:35:02,320
Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.

380
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,306
Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester.

381
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,040
That will be all for now. Your Grace.

382
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,613
Since I've missed the past several small council meetings,

383
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:39,546
I wanted to speak to you about a few things.

384
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,600
I've been thinking about the High Sparrow. As have we all, unfortunately.

385
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,208
We need to be careful in dealing with such a man.

386
00:35:50,906 --> 00:35:53,217
To prevent things from escalating any further.

387
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,715
We have to be careful not to antagonize him.

388
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:00,186
He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk.

389
00:36:00,186 --> 00:36:01,751
- He's dangerous. - Look at me.

390
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:06,764
What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?

391
00:36:11,573 --> 00:36:12,435
It's all right.

392
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:16,320
It's done. It's in the past.

393
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:18,471
And of course

394
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:21,200
Margaery's safety is paramount.

395
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,951
You don't like Margaery, do you?

396
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,884
Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant.

397
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:35,777
Margaery is the queen.

398
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:40,840
Queens must command respect. Kings even more so.

399
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:43,608
Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's.

400
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,853
The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens.

401
00:36:49,431 --> 00:36:53,911
No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world.

402
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,004
He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?

403
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
With fantasies.

404
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:01,715
With beggars in the street.

405
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:02,782
With nothing.

406
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:06,071
Mother...

407
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,270
there's something I want to tell you.

408
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:13,368
Something the High Sparrow told me.

409
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,248
You've spoken with him?

410
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:24,266
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told--

411
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:26,800
It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly

412
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,128
given his constant prattling about the truth.

413
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,542
I am your mother.

414
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:37,760
You can always trust me.

415
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:49,866
The small council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.

416
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:52,568
I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time.

417
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:53,555
You're not welcome.

418
00:37:53,555 --> 00:37:55,413
You once spoke of your respect for our father

419
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:58,257
because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.

420
00:37:58,257 --> 00:38:03,253
My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority,

421
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:06,260
publically shamed, and confined to the Red Keep.

422
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,648
What's left to work with?

423
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:10,453
Cersei is the mother of the king.

424
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:13,217
She has the king's ear and his trust.

425
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,191
And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

426
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:24,666
The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back.

427
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:27,084
Here we are. Well done to us.

428
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:31,368
Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rests in his dirty peasant hands.

429
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:33,448
In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.

430
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,620
But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement.

431
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:43,280
Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.

432
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:44,871
Oh, no.

433
00:38:46,444 --> 00:38:47,697
That cannot happen.

434
00:38:49,235 --> 00:38:51,893
That will not happen. I agree.

435
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,893
You've got the second largest army in Westeros.

436
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:02,384
You'll bring them into the city, stop Queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts,

437
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,222
and take her back into Crown custody.

438
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,880
The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow

439
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,053
or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.

440
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:16,490
You will take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down.

441
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,964
Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?

442
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:23,324
No, but if the king should call--

443
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:26,471
The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything.

444
00:39:26,506 --> 00:39:30,000
When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably,

445
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:32,640
and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,

446
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,457
do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?

447
00:39:35,635 --> 00:39:38,088
You hate these fanatics as much as we do.

448
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:41,084
You hate what they've done to your son.

449
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:45,128
Do you want Lancel back? Or have you given him up for good?

450
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:49,004
Of course I want him back.

451
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,324
Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.

452
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:05,510
If it doesn't go as planned, the sparrows have many friends in this city.

453
00:40:05,911 --> 00:40:08,000
We'll have civil war. Many will die.

454
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:10,808
Many will die no matter what we do.

455
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:14,053
Better them than us.

456
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,413
They told me you were home and I didn't believe it.

457
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,315
"Theon Greyjoy?" I said.

458
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:19,342
"He's dead.

459
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:22,666
He's been dead a long time."

460
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:29,173
He let you go? I escaped.

461
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,208
I can't hear you. I escaped.

462
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:39,440
Look at me.

463
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:50,000
Look at me.

464
00:41:51,102 --> 00:41:53,511
Men died trying to rescue you.

465
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:57,128
Good men. My men.

466
00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:02,053
I'm sorry. You were my brother.

467
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:05,555
You were a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother

468
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:09,226
and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.

469
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,368
I know. I know and I'm sorry.

470
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:12,577
Stop saying that.

471
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:17,840
He broke me. He broke me into 1,000 pieces.

472
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,102
- I know. - You don't know.

473
00:42:19,102 --> 00:42:21,262
He sent us one of those pieces.

474
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,680
That's why I came for you.

475
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,777
Why did you come here? Where else could I go?

476
00:42:33,777 --> 00:42:36,764
You heard Father was dead and you thought you'd claim the crown?

477
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,840
No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.

478
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,475
You happen to show up on Pyke right before the kingsmoot? I didn't know.

479
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:51,964
You think any ironborn wants you to be king after what you've done?

480
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,831
I don't want to be king.

481
00:42:54,568 --> 00:42:55,795
What do you want?

482
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,649
I should have listened to you. You're the only one--

483
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:02,053
That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying.

484
00:43:02,106 --> 00:43:03,288
Look at me.

485
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:07,511
Tell me what you want.

486
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:14,053
You should rule the Iron Islands.

487
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:17,226
Let me help you.

488
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:46,337
They've cleaned you up nicely.

489
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:49,982
You know who I am?

490
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,266
A lord. Yes.

491
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,622
A lord.

492
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:00,302
You've seen my banners?

493
00:44:01,404 --> 00:44:02,764
The flayed man.

494
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:05,520
Does that worry you at all?

495
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:08,497
You eat them after?

496
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,413
No.

497
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:15,893
Then I've seen worse.

498
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:42,293
You served the Starks?

499
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:47,062
Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat,

500
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,435
so I served them.

501
00:44:48,782 --> 00:44:51,057
The Starks have been gone for a long time,

502
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,666
but you kept protecting Rickon.

503
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,240
He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer.

504
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:00,142
I served his family a long time.

505
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:01,520
Didn't get no wages.

506
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,253
Way I see it, I'm owed.

507
00:45:07,973 --> 00:45:09,262
Be that as it may,

508
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,020
Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.

509
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,417
He's mine.

510
00:45:14,977 --> 00:45:17,413
So what use could I possibly have for you?

511
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:22,660
I can give you what you want.

512
00:45:22,817 --> 00:45:24,720
And you're sure you know what that is?

513
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,888
Same thing men always want.

514
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,302
And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.

515
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,328
You're a good talker.

516
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,080
I like that.

517
00:45:56,995 --> 00:46:00,071
You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.

518
00:46:01,937 --> 00:46:03,128
That so?

519
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,222
I had to work hard to get him talking.

520
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:07,946
But he talked.

521
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:09,982
They all do.

522
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:12,382
He told me everything.

523
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,210
All about the Stark boys,

524
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,988
who helped them escape, and how she did it.

525
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:49,591
Open the gate!

526
00:47:37,626 --> 00:47:39,306
Sorry about the food.

527
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,502
It's not what we're known for.

528
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:44,071
That's all right. There are more important things.

529
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:50,970
A letter for you, Lord Commander.

530
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,426
I'm not Lord Commander anymore.

531
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:17,120
"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow.

532
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:20,373
You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall.

533
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:23,706
You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North.

534
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:27,413
Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see.

535
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:30,950
Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.

536
00:48:39,804 --> 00:48:41,653
His direwolf's skin is on my floor.

537
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:44,609
Come and see. I want my bride back.

538
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:45,831
Send her to me, bastard,

539
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:48,435
and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers.

540
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,235
Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter

541
00:48:51,235 --> 00:48:54,826
every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection.

542
00:48:55,457 --> 00:48:57,493
You will watch as I skin them living.

543
00:48:57,493 --> 00:48:58,328
You--"

544
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:03,973
Go on. It's just more of the same.

545
00:49:09,173 --> 00:49:12,737
"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister.

546
00:49:14,222 --> 00:49:17,617
You will watch as my dogs devour your wild little brother.

547
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:24,044
Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.

548
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:29,520
Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."

549
00:49:33,288 --> 00:49:37,050
Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

550
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:38,506
His father's dead.

551
00:49:40,755 --> 00:49:41,973
Ramsay killed him.

552
00:49:42,168 --> 00:49:43,946
- And now he has Rickon. - We don't know that.

553
00:49:43,946 --> 00:49:44,951
Yes, we do.

554
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,260
How many men does he have in his army?

555
00:49:51,484 --> 00:49:55,395
I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.

556
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:57,520
How many do you have?

557
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,333
That can march and fight?

558
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:02,373
2,000.

559
00:50:03,713 --> 00:50:06,414
The rest are children and old people.

560
00:50:11,386 --> 00:50:14,266
You're the son of the last true Warden of the North.

561
00:50:14,408 --> 00:50:17,688
Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.

562
00:50:20,008 --> 00:50:24,168
A monster has taken our home and our brother.

563
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,444
We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.

564
00:50:41,008 --> 00:50:43,802
IT IS FORBIDDEN TO...

565
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:47,180
IT IS FORBIDDEN TO CARRY...

566
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,016
SO WE DON'T...

567
00:50:49,016 --> 00:50:51,894
WELL...

568
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:55,230
SOMEONE CRUSHED...

569
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:57,524
AGGO BELONGED...

570
00:50:57,524 --> 00:50:59,443
HE SERVED ME WELL.

571
00:50:59,443 --> 00:51:01,945
HE GOT HIS HEAD...

572
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:03,030
FUCK AGGO.

573
00:51:10,037 --> 00:51:12,039
BRING IN DROGO'S WIDOW.

574
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:38,440
WHO CARES ABOUT HER?...

575
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,275
I LIKE HER.

576
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:42,152
SHE'S PALER THAN MILK.

577
00:51:42,152 --> 00:51:44,821
I'D LIKE TO...

578
00:51:44,863 --> 00:51:45,864
GOOD.

579
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:47,491
YOU CAN SUCK ...

580
00:51:48,283 --> 00:51:51,203
SHE BELONGS WITH...

581
00:51:51,203 --> 00:51:53,664
THE WISE MASTERS OF...

582
00:51:53,664 --> 00:51:56,625
THEY'RE OFFERING TEN...

583
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,043
WHAT'S WORTH MORE,

584
00:51:58,043 --> 00:52:00,754
ONE PINK LITTLE GIRL...

585
00:52:00,754 --> 00:52:04,174
FUCK THE WISE MASTERS...

586
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:06,718
I'LL TAKE THEIR...

587
00:52:07,344 --> 00:52:10,013
DON'T YOU WANT TO...

588
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:14,810
YOU'D RATHER BE...

589
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,563
OR MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO...

590
00:52:18,563 --> 00:52:19,982
NO.

591
00:52:19,982 --> 00:52:21,900
I DON'T WANT EITHER...

592
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,694
WE DON'T CARE...

593
00:52:23,694 --> 00:52:25,946
THIS IS THE TEMPLE...

594
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:27,614
YOU HAVE NO...

595
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:29,866
UNLESS YOU ARE...

596
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:32,619
WHICH YOU ARE NOT,...

597
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:36,498
I KNOW WHERE I AM...

598
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:41,378
THIS IS WHERE THE...

599
00:52:41,378 --> 00:52:43,380
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

600
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:45,882
YOU TEUSTED A ...

601
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:49,636
YOUR BABY IS DEAD...

602
00:52:49,636 --> 00:52:51,972
AND SO IS...

603
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:57,894
THIS IS WHERE...

604
00:52:57,894 --> 00:53:01,773
TO RIDE WOODEN HORSES...

605
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:07,738
HE PROMISED TO KILL...

606
00:53:08,363 --> 00:53:11,616
HE SWORE TO ME ...

607
00:53:11,616 --> 00:53:13,910
AND YOU WERE DUMB...

608
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:18,165
AND HERE,NOW,...

609
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:20,375
WHICH LITTLE VILLAGES...

610
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:24,588
HOW MANY GIRLS ...

611
00:53:24,629 --> 00:53:26,923
YOU ARE SMALL MEN.

612
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:30,469
NONE OF YOU ARE...

613
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:35,432
BUT I AM.

614
00:53:37,434 --> 00:53:39,895
SO I WILL.

615
00:53:48,945 --> 00:53:50,322
ALL RIGHT.

616
00:53:50,947 --> 00:53:52,949
NO DOSH KHALEEN FOR YOU.

617
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,037
INSTEAD WE'LL...

618
00:53:57,037 --> 00:54:00,916
AND THEN WE'LL...

619
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:06,421
AND IF THERE'S...

620
00:54:06,922 --> 00:54:09,966
WE'LL GIVE OUR...

621
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:15,097
YOU CRAZY CUNT.

622
00:54:15,722 --> 00:54:19,184
DID YOU REALLY THINK ...

623
00:54:25,524 --> 00:54:27,526
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SERVE.

624
00:54:27,526 --> 00:54:29,319
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.
