

4
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,818
Your Grace. The trial will be getting under way soon.

5
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,103
You got my money?

6
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,863
Later. Go away.

7
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,423
Grand Maester.

8
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:56,267
Ser Loras Tyrell.

9
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,890
Are you prepared to stand trial

10
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,343
and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?

11
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,565
There'll be no need for a trial.

12
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:17,290
I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.

13
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,752
To which crimes will you be confessing?

14
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:23,450
All of them.

15
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:31,040
I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

16
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,596
I perjured myself before the gods.

17
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:39,547
I am guilty of depravity...

18
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:42,027
dishonesty,

19
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,596
profligacy,

20
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:46,516
and arrogance.

21
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:48,721
I see that now.

22
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:56,765
I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.

23
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:05,876
The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair.

24
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:12,303
The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice.

25
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:20,774
But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.

26
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:34,525
I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires.

27
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:43,530
My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven.

28
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:48,925
May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.

29
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:56,276
You understand fully what this means?

30
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,001
I do.

31
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:04,321
I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it.

32
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:10,090
I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden.

33
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:17,947
I will never marry and I will never father children.

34
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:24,027
Brother Loras...

35
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:28,730
...I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.

36
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:38,134
Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?

37
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:39,583
I will.

38
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:13,245
No, I can't let them... Faith is the way, Father.

39
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,334
All right.

40
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,550
I'm ready.

41
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:48,978
I have to go. I'm...

42
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,654
I'm late for the trial.

43
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,076
You mutilated him.

44
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:11,378
You gave me your word. And I have kept my word.

45
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,356
Once the queen mother's trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave.

46
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:20,641
And where is the queen mother? Her litter never left the Red Keep.

47
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:25,965
It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.

48
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,147
Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

49
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,165
Get the others.

50
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:43,245
Where's the king?

51
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,596
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

52
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,654
What's the meaning of this? I was told that...

53
00:11:54,187 --> 00:11:57,263
I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence...

54
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,303
Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will.

55
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:03,938
Please forgive me if you can.

56
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,134
This pains me, my lord.

57
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,387
Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

58
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:51,174
But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.

59
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,130
The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you.

60
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,841
What are you doing?

61
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:13,627
There's something wrong.

62
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:18,614
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly.

63
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:21,503
Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.

64
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,041
Why do you think they're not here?

65
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:27,023
If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless.

66
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,378
We cannot escape the justice of the gods...

67
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:32,232
Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you!

68
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:37,618
Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway,

69
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:40,854
which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences.

70
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:45,298
The trial can wait. We all need to leave.

71
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:13,320
We all need to leave now!

72
00:16:18,063 --> 00:16:19,050
Loras.

73
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,107
Stay with me.

74
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,187
Let me through. Let me through.

75
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,001
Get out of my way.

76
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,743
Let us through.

77
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:23,503
Confess.

78
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,592
Confess.

79
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,956
- No. - Confess.

80
00:18:44,347 --> 00:18:47,080
Confess. It felt good.

81
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:50,552
Beating me, starving me,

82
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,890
frightening me, humiliating me.

83
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,823
You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement.

84
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,072
You did it because it felt good.

85
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,174
I understand.

86
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,285
I do things because they feel good.

87
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:14,152
I drink because it feels good.

88
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,765
I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him.

89
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:26,650
I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me.

90
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:29,485
I lie about fucking my brother...

91
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,530
because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites.

92
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,258
I killed your High Sparrow...

93
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:44,240
and all his little sparrows...

94
00:19:45,814 --> 00:19:48,463
all his septons, all his septas,

95
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,450
all his filthy soldiers,

96
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:55,307
because it felt good to watch them burn.

97
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,774
It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain.

98
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:04,187
No thought has ever given me greater joy.

99
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,930
Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.

100
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,387
You've always been quiet.

101
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,703
I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died.

102
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:33,734
Do you remember?

103
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,756
Good.

104
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,334
I'm glad to see your face.

105
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,423
I'm ready to meet the gods. What?

106
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,396
Now? Today?

107
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,703
You're not going to die today.

108
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:03,734
You're not going to die for quite a while.

109
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,476
Ser Gregor.

110
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,107
This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

111
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:16,570
He's quiet, too.

112
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,956
Your gods have forsaken you.

113
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:32,863
This is your god now.

114
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:45,334
No.

115
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,694
No.

116
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,112
Shame.

117
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:54,463
Shame.

118
00:21:56,881 --> 00:21:57,992
Shame.

119
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:07,725
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

120
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:10,676
Very sorry.

121
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:57,663
For House Lannister!

122
00:22:57,663 --> 00:22:59,530
Hear me roar!

123
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:07,396
For House Frey!

124
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:09,698
We stand together!

125
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:16,125
May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last.

126
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:20,347
And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts,

127
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,574
may we speak the words of our alliance,

128
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:29,876
"The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards."

129
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,530
You don't even have to do anything, do you?

130
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,845
You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.

131
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:57,538
- You're welcome to her. - She doesn't want me.

132
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,983
She wants your golden fingers up her twat.

133
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,752
Those two have their eyes on you.

134
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,098
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

135
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,432
Not my type. Not blonde enough?

136
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:17,165
Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

137
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,610
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

138
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:21,938
- There you go. - Maybe I'm not in the mood.

139
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,303
Fuck it. No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.

140
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:37,858
This came together rather well.

141
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:41,681
Your father would be pleased.

142
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:43,005
I'm sure he would be.

143
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,143
Edmure is back in a cell.

144
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,974
Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right.

145
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:54,980
Give the family a bad name.

146
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:02,410
So the famous Blackfish killed by foot soldiers, eh?

147
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:05,423
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

148
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:09,005
Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?

149
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:11,645
I'm a bit old for all that.

150
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:14,081
No, but back in your day.

151
00:25:15,698 --> 00:25:20,054
The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

152
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,552
I've defeated mine.

153
00:25:23,227 --> 00:25:26,872
Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years.

154
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,027
Now it's mine.

155
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:29,778
What do you call that?

156
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:35,041
Victory. Yes, you're a great conqueror.

157
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,450
Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?

158
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,712
The Tullys mocked me for years.

159
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:46,436
The Starks mocked me. Where are they now?

160
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:49,565
You talk about war as if you're an expert,

161
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,796
but the one battle I remember you fighting,

162
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:54,910
you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.

163
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:56,934
But it doesn't matter.

164
00:25:57,743 --> 00:26:01,450
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

165
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:05,272
We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces

166
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,903
and snigger behind our backs.

167
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:13,743
We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing.

168
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:17,556
They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters.

169
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,378
We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands.

170
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:25,370
If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them,

171
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,787
why do we need you?

172
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:51,201
Show me.

173
00:26:54,685 --> 00:26:57,218
Your Grace, there's no need... Show me.

174
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:13,476
What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral?

175
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,103
As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option,

176
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,276
perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

177
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:28,276
He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister.

178
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:32,081
Burn him

179
00:27:34,116 --> 00:27:36,338
and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.

180
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,201
Hello.

181
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,601
From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.

182
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:01,992
I'm...

183
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,774
I'm to be the new maester.

184
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,743
According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

185
00:29:27,414 --> 00:29:31,263
He died. We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.

186
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:34,934
Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election.

187
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,827
He's since passed away.

188
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,000
Which is why I'm here.

189
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:47,592
This is irregular. Yes, well...

190
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:50,961
I suppose that life is irregular.

191
00:30:02,863 --> 00:30:05,983
The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you.

192
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:12,338
In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library.

193
00:30:12,952 --> 00:30:13,876
Follow me.

194
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,747
No women or children.

195
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,290
When we had feasts,

196
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:18,120
our family would sit up here...

197
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,707
and I'd sit down there.

198
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,125
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

199
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,454
You had a family. You had feasts.

200
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:34,925
Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.

201
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:51,903
What is that?

202
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,210
Tell him.

203
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,165
Tell him who it belonged to.

204
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:09,387
The Princess Shireen. Tell him what you did to her.

205
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,592
Tell him!

206
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:22,063
We burned her at the stake.

207
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,494
Why?

208
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:40,440
The army was trapped. The horses were dying.

209
00:33:40,703 --> 00:33:43,529
- It was the only way. - You burned a little girl alive!

210
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,792
I only do what my Lord commands.

211
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:48,561
If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil.

212
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,672
We are standing here because of him.

213
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,276
Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.

214
00:33:58,276 --> 00:34:02,090
I loved that girl like she was my own.

215
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:05,361
She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!

216
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,827
So did her father.

217
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:12,525
So did her mother.

218
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,103
Her own blood knew it was the only way.

219
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:21,663
The only way for what? They all died anyway.

220
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,423
You told everyone Stannis was the one.

221
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:27,750
You had him believing it, all of them fooled.

222
00:34:27,787 --> 00:34:29,574
- And you lied. - I didn't lie.

223
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:36,116
I was wrong. Aye, you were wrong.

224
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:40,285
How many died because you were wrong?

225
00:34:45,707 --> 00:34:49,450
I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder.

226
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,076
She admits to the crime.

227
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:55,787
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

228
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:00,783
I've been ready to die for many years.

229
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,387
If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not.

230
00:35:05,974 --> 00:35:08,223
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

231
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:11,690
You know the great war is still to come.

232
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:15,330
You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon.

233
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,103
And you know I can help you win that war.

234
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:35,174
Ride south today.

235
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:40,836
If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

236
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:01,645
If you ever come back this way,

237
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:04,018
I will execute you myself.

238
00:36:36,578 --> 00:36:38,712
I'm having the lord's chamber prepared for you.

239
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,258
Mother and Father's room?

240
00:36:44,383 --> 00:36:45,618
You should take it.

241
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:48,845
I'm not a Stark.

242
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,494
You are to me.

243
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:57,601
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

244
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,814
You deserve it. We're standing here because of you.

245
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:04,072
The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in.

246
00:37:04,863 --> 00:37:06,356
They came because of you.

247
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:13,556
You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.

248
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:16,020
- He did. - And you trust him?

249
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:19,716
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

250
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:24,907
I should have told you about him,

251
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,912
about the Knights of the Vale.

252
00:37:29,636 --> 00:37:30,578
I'm sorry.

253
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:43,885
We need to trust each other.

254
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,032
We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

255
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,530
We have so many enemies now.

256
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,307
Jon.

257
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:10,365
A raven came from the Citadel.

258
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:13,041
A white raven.

259
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,663
Winter is here.

260
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:32,685
Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

261
00:38:47,565 --> 00:38:52,232
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated.

262
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:55,067
100 red scorpions, was it?

263
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:57,903
You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.

264
00:38:58,187 --> 00:39:02,054
You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?

265
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:04,916
We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.

266
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,672
You came to Dorne because you needed our help.

267
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:09,832
What is your name again?

268
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,201
Barbaro? Obara.

269
00:39:13,272 --> 00:39:16,401
Obara. You look like an angry little boy.

270
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:18,916
Don't presume to tell me what I need.

271
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:22,152
Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

272
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,361
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

273
00:39:26,054 --> 00:39:27,556
No? Good.

274
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,885
Let the grown women speak.

275
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,460
The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell.

276
00:39:35,183 --> 00:39:36,952
They have declared war on Dorne.

277
00:39:37,956 --> 00:39:41,387
We must be allies now if we wish to survive.

278
00:39:42,738 --> 00:39:44,730
Cersei stole the future from me.

279
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,014
She killed my son. She killed my grandson.

280
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,583
She killed my granddaughter.

281
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:55,494
Survival is not what I'm after now.

282
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,752
You're absolutely right.

283
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,241
I chose the wrong words.

284
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:03,156
It is not survival I offer.

285
00:40:03,627 --> 00:40:05,707
It is your heart's desire.

286
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:10,676
And what is my heart's desire?

287
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,441
Vengeance.

288
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:15,556
Justice.

289
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,023
Fire and blood.

290
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:29,761
Your ships are nearly ready.

291
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:32,952
I saw them painting the sails.

292
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:39,654
I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.

293
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,912
You're not coming with us.

294
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:45,832
New strategy?

295
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,507
You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast?

296
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:53,690
If we take Casterly Rock,

297
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:57,823
the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.

298
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:02,250
You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons.

299
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:05,420
There's finally peace in Meereen.

300
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:09,130
You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.

301
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:13,414
Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people.

302
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:17,601
I'm here for you, not them. You promised me.

303
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,130
"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

304
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,627
This is what I command.

305
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:28,890
If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances.

306
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:33,787
The best way to make alliances is with marriage.

307
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:38,721
Who are you marrying this time?

308
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:42,321
I don't know. Maybe no one.

309
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:45,041
But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table?

310
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:47,592
Are you a queen or fish bait?

311
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:53,014
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

312
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:55,349
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

313
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:58,134
So that's what you want? To be my mistress?

314
00:41:58,134 --> 00:42:03,770
I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room.

315
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,032
I don't want a crown. I want you.

316
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,378
I love you.

317
00:42:16,072 --> 00:42:17,334
And I make you happy.

318
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,463
You know I do.

319
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,516
Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

320
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:35,440
I can't.

321
00:42:45,467 --> 00:42:47,032
The dwarf told you to do this?

322
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,881
No one tells me to do anything.

323
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:51,583
Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic.

324
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:54,881
I'm no use to you over there. Don't get angry.

325
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:58,365
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

326
00:42:58,641 --> 00:42:59,912
Who comes after you?

327
00:43:00,107 --> 00:43:03,458
Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

328
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,698
A great number of women, I imagine.

329
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:17,094
Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.

330
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,543
Bay of Dragons?

331
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:21,414
We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?

332
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:28,072
You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it.

333
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,174
I hope it brings you happiness.

334
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,023
I pity the lords of Westeros.

335
00:43:39,947 --> 00:43:41,725
They have no idea what's coming for them.

336
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,343
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

337
00:44:05,032 --> 00:44:06,214
How did he take it?

338
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:08,196
No tears.

339
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,330
I know it was hard for you.

340
00:44:13,841 --> 00:44:18,578
You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

341
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:26,810
That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation.

342
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:34,410
It's not. No, I suppose not.

343
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,841
I'm terrible at consoling. Yes, you really are.

344
00:44:41,823 --> 00:44:45,740
All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening?

345
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:51,565
You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons.

346
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:56,934
Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything,

347
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,881
it's all yours for the taking.

348
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:02,561
Are you afraid?

349
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,943
Good.

350
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,010
You're in the great game now.

351
00:45:11,085 --> 00:45:13,041
And the great game's terrifying.

352
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:17,725
The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.

353
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:21,965
Do you know what frightens me?

354
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:26,694
I said farewell to a man who loves me.

355
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:30,463
A man I thought I cared for.

356
00:45:32,658 --> 00:45:33,787
And I felt nothing.

357
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:37,485
Just impatient to get on with it.

358
00:45:41,023 --> 00:45:45,698
He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.

359
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:55,058
Well, you have completely failed to console me.

360
00:45:57,556 --> 00:46:01,476
For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember.

361
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:04,854
Everyone's always asking me to believe in things...

362
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:08,392
family, gods, kings, myself.

363
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:13,160
It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people.

364
00:46:14,703 --> 00:46:17,298
So I said no, thank you to belief.

365
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:20,463
And yet here I am.

366
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,032
I believe in you.

367
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,707
It's embarrassing, really.

368
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:36,658
I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword.

369
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:38,872
It's your counsel I need.

370
00:46:39,894 --> 00:46:41,041
It's yours.

371
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,020
Now and always.

372
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,236
Good.

373
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:48,943
I...

374
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:51,272
I had something made for you.

375
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:55,618
I'm not sure if it's right.

376
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,250
Tyrion Lannister,

377
00:47:07,938 --> 00:47:09,432
I name you Hand of the Queen.

378
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:46,580
You're not one of mine, are you?

379
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,467
No, my lord. Didn't think so.

380
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,107
Too pretty.

381
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:59,307
Where are my damn moron sons?!

382
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:03,005
Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.

383
00:48:03,752 --> 00:48:05,014
They're here, my lord.

384
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,658
Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs?

385
00:48:08,738 --> 00:48:10,552
Tell them to come here now.

386
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:13,023
But they're already here, my lord.

387
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:20,232
Here, my lord.

388
00:48:38,747 --> 00:48:40,605
They weren't easy to carve.

389
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:44,178
Especially Black Walder.

390
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:46,712
What...

391
00:48:53,832 --> 00:48:57,350
My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that.

392
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:03,325
The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.

393
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,396
Forgive me, my lady...

394
00:50:01,325 --> 00:50:02,632
if you're at prayer.

395
00:50:04,925 --> 00:50:06,170
I'm done with all that.

396
00:50:08,765 --> 00:50:10,970
I came here every day when I was a girl.

397
00:50:12,703 --> 00:50:14,365
I prayed to be somewhere else.

398
00:50:16,036 --> 00:50:19,227
Back then I only thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.

399
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:24,632
I was a stupid girl.

400
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:26,632
You were a child.

401
00:50:30,463 --> 00:50:31,601
What do you want?

402
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:34,774
I thought you knew what I wanted.

403
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,547
I was wrong. No, you weren't.

404
00:50:42,552 --> 00:50:44,045
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

405
00:50:44,045 --> 00:50:46,410
I close my eyes and see the same picture.

406
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:49,201
Whenever I consider an action,

407
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:55,538
I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality?

408
00:50:57,823 --> 00:51:01,858
Pull it out of my mind and into the world?

409
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:07,014
And I only act if the answer is yes.

410
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,512
A picture of me...

411
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,792
on the Iron Throne...

412
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,325
and you by my side.

413
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:30,925
It's a pretty picture.

414
00:51:37,547 --> 00:51:40,570
News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

415
00:51:40,827 --> 00:51:43,067
I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.

416
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,694
You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish.

417
00:51:46,694 --> 00:51:51,521
It's never stopped you from serving yourself. The past is gone for good.

418
00:51:52,303 --> 00:51:56,845
You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future.

419
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,872
You, my love,

420
00:51:59,778 --> 00:52:01,618
are the future of House Stark.

421
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,378
Who should the North rally behind?

422
00:52:06,676 --> 00:52:10,383
A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell

423
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:13,850
or a motherless bastard born in the south?

424
00:52:40,721 --> 00:52:44,330
This is where I leave you. You're not coming with us?

425
00:52:46,418 --> 00:52:48,321
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

426
00:52:50,054 --> 00:52:52,978
Ancient spells were carved into its foundations.

427
00:52:54,498 --> 00:52:59,316
Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond.

428
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,458
And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass.

429
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:22,961
Where will you go?

430
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:27,565
The great war is coming and I still fight for the living.

431
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:31,645
I'll do what I can...

432
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,907
as long as I can.

433
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:41,494
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

434
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:44,081
I wish you both good fortune.

435
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:26,187
Are you sure you're ready for this?

436
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:28,258
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.

437
00:54:29,805 --> 00:54:31,698
I have to be ready for this.

438
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,961
Ned?

439
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:08,881
Lyanna.

440
00:55:10,898 --> 00:55:12,045
Is that you?

441
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:18,098
Is that really you?

442
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:24,783
You're not a dream?

443
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,045
No, I'm not a dream.

444
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:31,592
I'm here.

445
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,290
Right here.

446
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:37,592
I've missed you, big brother.

447
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:42,890
I've missed you, too.

448
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:49,538
I want to be brave.

449
00:55:53,574 --> 00:55:54,463
You are.

450
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:55,796
I'm not.

451
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:01,201
I don't want to die.

452
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:04,525
You're not going to die.

453
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:10,623
Get her some water!

454
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:12,978
- No, no water. - Is there a maester?

455
00:56:12,978 --> 00:56:14,561
Listen to me, Ned.

456
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:25,610
If Robert finds out, he'll... you know he will.

457
00:56:26,578 --> 00:56:28,500
You have to protect him.

458
00:56:31,672 --> 00:56:32,970
Promise me, Ned.

459
00:56:36,045 --> 00:56:37,227
Promise me.

460
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,281
Promise me, Ned.

461
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,130
Promise me.

462
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:34,285
You can't expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.

463
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:38,232
We didn't invade. We were invited.

464
00:57:38,232 --> 00:57:39,494
Not by me.

465
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:44,134
The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely,

466
00:57:44,134 --> 00:57:45,930
fought together, and we won.

467
00:57:47,334 --> 00:57:51,450
My father used to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.

468
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,027
The Boltons are defeated.

469
00:57:54,543 --> 00:57:57,930
The war is over. Winter has come.

470
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:01,805
If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years.

471
00:58:02,401 --> 00:58:05,494
We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.

472
00:58:05,494 --> 00:58:07,130
The war is not over.

473
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:12,561
And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm.

474
00:58:13,343 --> 00:58:14,640
He brings the storm.

475
00:58:34,872 --> 00:58:38,294
Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

476
00:58:38,898 --> 00:58:40,418
but you refused the call.

477
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:46,650
You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover,

478
00:58:47,147 --> 00:58:51,565
but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call.

479
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:59,645
And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton.

480
00:58:59,992 --> 00:59:02,365
Still you refused the call.

481
00:59:05,636 --> 00:59:07,796
But House Mormont remembers.

482
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,930
The North remembers.

483
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:16,694
We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.

484
00:59:18,907 --> 00:59:22,916
I don't care if he's a bastard. Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins.

485
00:59:22,987 --> 00:59:27,281
He's my king from this day until his last day.

486
00:59:44,285 --> 00:59:48,267
Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly.

487
00:59:52,765 --> 00:59:55,787
My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf.

488
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:59,832
I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime.

489
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:05,218
I didn't commit my men to your cause 'cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing.

490
01:00:07,876 --> 01:00:08,863
But I was wrong.

491
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,201
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

492
01:00:17,787 --> 01:00:22,018
He is the White Wolf. The King in the North.

493
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:36,205
I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day.

494
01:00:37,023 --> 01:00:42,356
A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.

495
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,343
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

496
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,321
There will be more fights to come.

497
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:59,032
House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years.

498
01:01:00,507 --> 01:01:02,940
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

499
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:07,014
the King in the North!

500
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:10,792
The King in the North!

501
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:54,197
The King in the North! The King in the North!

502
01:01:55,601 --> 01:01:57,681
Company halt!

503
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:01,618
Halt!

504
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:05,681
Halt!

505
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,094
Come on.

506
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:19,387
I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name,

507
01:03:20,383 --> 01:03:23,227
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

508
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,260
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

509
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,934
Long may she reign.

510
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:17,067
Long may she reign.
