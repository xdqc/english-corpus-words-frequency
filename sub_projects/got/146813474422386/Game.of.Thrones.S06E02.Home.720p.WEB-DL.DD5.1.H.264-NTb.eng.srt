4
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,354
Give him another go, Ned.

5
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:48,479
That's my father. And my Uncle Benjen.

6
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:52,138
Keep your shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell.

7
00:03:00,452 --> 00:03:01,795
They were all so happy.

8
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:05,448
So were you once.

9
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,033
Stop showing off.

10
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,605
Lyanna!

11
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
My Aunt Lyanna.

12
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:19,598
I've seen her statue in the crypt.

13
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,801
My father never talked about her.

14
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:32,599
Would you get out of here? We're sparring.

15
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:35,113
Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

16
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:38,543
- I don't know.
- What about him?

17
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:43,010
Wylis, come here.

18
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:52,271
- Hodor?
- But he's got giant's blood.

19
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,752
And you've got training. Sounds like a fair match to me.

20
00:03:56,172 --> 00:04:01,301
- Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.
- And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.

21
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,069
Hodor talks?

22
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,500
You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis. Come along, now. It's no place for you.

23
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,349
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him. If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable.

24
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,715
Well, he's never going to learn to fight because he's a stable boy. So leave him be.

25
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,261
It is time to go.

26
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,921
Please, a little longer.

27
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:46,186
You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away.

28
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:49,050
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

29
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,596
but if you stay too long, you'll drown.

30
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:56,437
I wasn't drowning. I was home.

31
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:10,967
Wylis.

32
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:13,229
Hodor.

33
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:15,209
I saw you as a boy.

34
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:17,170
You could talk.

35
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,078
What happened?

36
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:22,717
Hodor.

37
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:29,300
Where's Meera?

38
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,737
Hodor.

39
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,077
You shouldn't be here.

40
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:03,461
It's not safe outside the cave.

41
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,372
It's not safe anywhere.

42
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:11,890
- I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.
- Hodor.

43
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,810
His real name is Wylis. And he could talk and fight and-- and then--

44
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,232
What's wrong?

45
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:26,211
The Three-Eyed Raven says there's a war coming.

46
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,358
And we're going to fight it in there?

47
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,853
Brandon Stark needs you.

48
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,831
For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens.

49
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:09,706
He isn't going to stay here forever.

50
00:07:10,123 --> 00:07:13,587
And out there he needs you.

51
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:42,051
It's time, Ser Davos.

52
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,031
Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace.

53
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:57,059
We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs.

54
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:02,893
Nobody needs to die tonight.

55
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:08,395
I've never been much of a fighter.

56
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:18,125
Apologies for what you're about to see.

57
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:26,965
Come on.

58
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,485
Attack!

59
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:25,547
Fight, you cowards!

60
00:09:57,794 --> 00:10:00,043
You fucking traitor.

61
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:05,250
The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander's heart.

62
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,361
For thousands of years the Night's Watch has held Castle Black against the wildlings.

63
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,532
Until you.

64
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:26,497
Throw them into the cells where they belong.

65
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,104
Took a lot of knives.

66
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:07,029
I'll have my men get the wood for a fire.

67
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,189
Bodies to burn.

68
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:25,043
Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei,

69
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,216
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

70
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:33,199
All of a sudden she looks my way. Gives me a little smile like, "Well?"

71
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:38,768
So, all right, you know, I've never been shy and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out.

72
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,504
She's never seen anything like it.

73
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:46,511
I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch.

74
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:52,389
She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips.

75
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,631
Well, you all know me. You know I wouldn't lie about this.

76
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:18,642
- Get out of my way.
- King's orders, Your Grace.

77
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,150
What are the king's orders?

78
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,427
He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace, for your own protection.

79
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:32,357
You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?

80
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:36,033
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's command, I cannot let you pass.

81
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,546
- I would like to speak to my son.
- He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

82
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:13,802
She grew up.

83
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,487
Almost.

84
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:19,571
Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers?

85
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:23,724
I expect it was Mother.

86
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:27,445
- Your mother wouldn't do that.
- Yes, she would.

87
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:31,923
Are you angry with her?

88
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:35,616
- Of course not. - Then why didn't you let her come?

89
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:37,834
She has every right to be here.

90
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,978
They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept.

91
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:47,245
- If she had tried--
- They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.

92
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:49,135
Not while I'm here.

93
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,444
Why haven't you gone to see her?

94
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:02,715
- Everything she endured, she did it for you.
- Don't you think I know that?

95
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,407
I'm sorry.

96
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:13,848
- But I can't.
- Why not?

97
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:18,433
When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery,

98
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:21,175
what did I do?

99
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,579
When they paraded her through the streets like a whore,

100
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:28,216
what did I do?

101
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,041
We all fail sometimes.

102
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,717
The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm.

103
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:39,803
If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?

104
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:43,728
Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you.

105
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:47,898
Your Grace.

106
00:15:49,154 --> 00:15:50,424
Lord Commander.

107
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,248
I want to see my wife.

108
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:58,840
The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy.

109
00:15:59,382 --> 00:16:02,302
The king must wait as well.

110
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:04,290
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

111
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,019
You're a bold man.

112
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,846
On the contrary.

113
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,072
I fear a great deal.

114
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:25,960
The Father, the Mother,

115
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:27,777
the Warrior.

116
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:41,510
Do you know why we use these stones?

117
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
To remind us not to fear death.

118
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:49,798
We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next.

119
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:52,137
You must long for the next life.

120
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:58,180
- In truth, I fear that, too.
- You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.

121
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,448
Your sister sought the gods' mercy and atoned for her sin.

122
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:05,189
What about my sins?

123
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:10,991
I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back.

124
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,856
I killed my own cousin.

125
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:19,992
When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice.

126
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,786
What atonement do I deserve?

127
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,184
You would spill blood in this holy place?

128
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,142
Oh, the gods won't mind. They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined.

129
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,272
Go on, then.

130
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,934
I deserve it. We all do.

131
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,130
We are weak, vain creatures.

132
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:47,681
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

133
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,744
They should be closer if you mean for them to save you.

134
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,183
I don't.

135
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:09,953
They'd never reach me before you struck.

136
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:14,866
- I've fought against worse odds.
- No doubt many of us would fall.

137
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:18,262
But who are we, hmm?

138
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:20,769
We have no names, no family.

139
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:24,419
Every one of us is poor and powerless.

140
00:18:25,459 --> 00:18:27,044
And yet together,

141
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,550
we can overthrow an empire.

142
00:19:01,258 --> 00:19:02,243
Mother.

143
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,966
Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?

144
00:19:18,902 --> 00:19:19,916
Gold.

145
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:22,688
Good. It was always her color.

146
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,399
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

147
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:32,815
I shouldn't have, but I was--

148
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,906
I didn't want to lose you again.

149
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:40,756
I understand.

150
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:44,351
I'm glad to see you.

151
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:50,086
I know I should have come sooner.

152
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,096
I wanted to. I was wrong.

153
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,799
It's all right.

154
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:01,528
No, it isn't.

155
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,334
I should have executed all of them.

156
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:11,754
I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you,

157
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,929
as you would have for me.

158
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,965
You raised me to be strong...

159
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:22,472
and I wasn't.

160
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,568
But I want to be.

161
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:30,622
Help me.

162
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,391
Always.

163
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:07,561
If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time.

164
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:13,223
Meaning no offense.

165
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:16,782
He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes.

166
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:19,492
- I do not make dwarf jokes.
- You think them.

167
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:25,576
So, the fleet. It's been burned.

168
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,250
We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything.

169
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,586
Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere.

170
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,465
Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid.

171
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,072
Perhaps they can tell us their secret.

172
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,864
The Masters have retaken both cities.

173
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,751
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers.

174
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:50,940
What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid.

175
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,809
They are not eating. They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left.

176
00:21:56,111 --> 00:21:57,986
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

177
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:01,377
Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious.

178
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:04,763
If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?

179
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:07,240
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

180
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,593
- How do you know this? - That's what I do.

181
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:12,432
I drink and I know things.

182
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:20,128
The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles.

183
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,287
Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens.

184
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:30,818
A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats.

185
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,976
They must be unchained or they'll waste away.

186
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:36,946
Missandei,

187
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,034
how many times were you in the company of these dragons?

188
00:22:41,585 --> 00:22:44,831
- Many times. - And did they ever harm you?

189
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:46,988
Never.

190
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:49,140
Dragons are intelligent.

191
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:52,543
More intelligent than men according to some maesters.

192
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,739
They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies.

193
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:00,821
- I am their friend. - Do they know that?

194
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:04,037
They will. It's time they had their supper.

195
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:36,810
I'm friends with your mother.

196
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,244
I'm here to help.

197
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,456
Don't eat the help.

198
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:58,506
When I was a child, an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day.

199
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,712
I begged him for one of you.

200
00:25:01,712 --> 00:25:04,916
"It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon," I told him.

201
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,169
"It could be little like me."

202
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:19,997
Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard.

203
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:23,048
Then my father told me

204
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:27,195
the last dragon had died a century ago.

205
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:30,930
I cried myself to sleep that night.

206
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:41,381
But here you are.

207
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:53,538
Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face.

208
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:09,358
What's your name?

209
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:17,658
What's your name?

210
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,038
- No one. - I don't believe that.

211
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:24,040
You don't believe that.

212
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:57,021
Who are you?

213
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:00,919
No one.

214
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:02,840
If a girl says her name,

215
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,227
a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight.

216
00:28:06,863 --> 00:28:08,441
A girl has no name.

217
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:12,746
If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight.

218
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,582
A girl has no name.

219
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,526
If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back.

220
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:24,985
A girl has no name.

221
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:33,916
Come.

222
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:44,749
Leave it.

223
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:47,430
A girl is not a beggar anymore.

224
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,552
We came upon the bodies on our way here.

225
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:04,376
Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?

226
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:08,937
- They obviously had help.
- I didn't think Lady Sansa killed them all by herself.

227
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:12,579
Thank you for this report, Lord Karstark.

228
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:14,882
We know where she's going.

229
00:29:15,263 --> 00:29:18,761
- Her brother's at Castle Black.
- Ned Stark's last surviving son?

230
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:21,121
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

231
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,182
So was I, Father.

232
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:28,732
Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door.

233
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:31,877
Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side.

234
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:35,497
And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves.

235
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:39,476
With a small force, we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow--

236
00:29:39,476 --> 00:29:42,093
Murder the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?

237
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:45,126
You'd unite every house in the North against us.

238
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:49,149
We don't need every house in the North.

239
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,854
The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks command more soldiers than all the other houses combined.

240
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:58,738
With their support, none could challenge us.

241
00:29:58,738 --> 00:30:02,648
The Starks lost my house the day King Robb cut off my father's head.

242
00:30:03,355 --> 00:30:05,604
It's time for new blood in the North.

243
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:19,294
If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you'll be treated as a mad dog.

244
00:30:19,983 --> 00:30:22,488
Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed.

245
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:24,624
My lords.

246
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,941
Lady Walda has given birth.

247
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:29,785
A boy.

248
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,203
- Red-cheeked and healthy.
- My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

249
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,054
Congratulations, Father.

250
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:51,167
I look forward to meeting my new brother.

251
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:58,191
You'll always be my firstborn.

252
00:30:59,707 --> 00:31:01,206
Thank you for saying that.

253
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,241
It means a great deal to me.

254
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,361
Maester Wolkan,

255
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:47,080
send ravens to all the northern houses. Roose Bolton is dead.

256
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,320
Poisoned by our enemies.

257
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,181
How did he die?

258
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,762
Poisoned by his enemies.

259
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:08,730
You're talking to your lord. Use respect.

260
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,811
Forgive me, my lord.

261
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:17,516
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

262
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,863
She's resting, my lord.

263
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:25,929
At once, my lord.

264
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:52,776
There he is.

265
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:54,899
Isn't he wonderful?

266
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:00,496
May I hold him?

267
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:03,594
Of-- of course.

268
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:15,169
Little brother.

269
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:19,392
Lord Bolton sent for us.

270
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:20,548
Have you seen him?

271
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:32,203
Of course. Follow me, Mother.

272
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,630
Where is Lord Bolton?

273
00:34:02,195 --> 00:34:03,092
Down!

274
00:34:05,046 --> 00:34:07,152
It's all right. Come on, shh.

275
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:10,685
It's cold out here, Ramsay. I need to feed him.

276
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:19,707
Ramsay, where is your father?

277
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,939
Ramsay.

278
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:32,276
Where is Lord Bolton?

279
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:41,090
I am Lord Bolton.

280
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:52,598
Ramsay.

281
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:54,996
Ramsay, please.

282
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:57,924
I'll leave Winterfell. I'll go back to the Riverlands.

283
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:04,980
Please.

284
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,321
Ramsay.

285
00:35:09,497 --> 00:35:10,938
He's your brother.

286
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:16,243
I prefer being an only child.

287
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:41,468
I saw her with a man. I don't think he hurt her.

288
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:44,518
She didn't want to leave him, he didn't want to leave her.

289
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,846
- You don't know which way she went?
- I spent three days looking for her.

290
00:35:51,572 --> 00:35:52,987
She disappeared.

291
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,987
- How'd she look?
- She looked good.

292
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:02,020
She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.

293
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:04,766
No, she wouldn't be.

294
00:36:07,259 --> 00:36:09,023
What happened at Winterfell?

295
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:23,194
I should have gone with you while I had the chance.

296
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:27,366
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

297
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:34,241
We've all had to make difficult choices.

298
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,654
We shouldn't be lighting fires. It's not safe. He won't stop hunting us.

299
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:04,289
We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us.

300
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:08,060
- Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
- I won't let him.

301
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,830
I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.

302
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:16,139
And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place.

303
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:18,868
And the truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

304
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:24,241
And the truth about Robb, who I betrayed.

305
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:30,785
- When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven.
- I don't want to be forgiven.

306
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:36,658
I can never make amends to your family for the things I've done.

307
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:41,223
They'll keep you safer than I ever could.

308
00:37:46,566 --> 00:37:48,127
You're not coming with us?

309
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:53,611
I would have taken you all the way to the Wall.

310
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,313
I would have died to get you there.

311
00:38:14,388 --> 00:38:16,187
May I take one of the horses?

312
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:21,554
Where will you go?

313
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,490
Home.

314
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:38,289
The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.

315
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,863
And the ironborn who held it?

316
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:45,209
They died fighting to a man.

317
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:50,931
- What is dead may never die.
- What is dead may never die.

318
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,803
But they did

319
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,805
and our invasion died with them.

320
00:38:56,737 --> 00:39:01,250
- Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.
- Then we will take more.

321
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:04,501
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

322
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:11,240
- Because I order it.
- We can defeat anyone at sea,

323
00:39:11,546 --> 00:39:14,739
but we'll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies.

324
00:39:14,739 --> 00:39:17,673
Not if our captains defy my orders,

325
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:22,015
abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.

326
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:24,067
I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon.

327
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:26,820
- Then where is he?
- Where is your kingdom?

328
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,998
We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over.

329
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:36,158
The last time we provoked them too far,

330
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:40,061
I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers.

331
00:39:40,757 --> 00:39:45,029
- I lost two brothers that day.
- And I lost three sons.

332
00:39:46,935 --> 00:39:50,528
The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead.

333
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,871
When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you want.

334
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:58,708
But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will.

335
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,010
Let me pass.

336
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:44,896
You fool, move aside for your king.

337
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,935
Haven't I always, brother?

338
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:02,259
I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now.

339
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:05,728
What is dead may never die.

340
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:13,793
Has the custom changed since I've been gone? Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?

341
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:18,804
- You can mock our god without my help.
- I don't mock the Drowned God.

342
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,050
I am the Drowned God.

343
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:24,265
From Oldtown to Qarth,

344
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:27,955
when men see my sails, they pray.

345
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,998
You're old, brother.

346
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:44,094
You've had your time. Now let another rule.

347
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:51,040
I heard you lost your mind during a storm on the Jade Sea.

348
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:56,142
They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.

349
00:41:57,076 --> 00:41:58,116
They did.

350
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:02,295
And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues.

351
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:04,660
I needed silence.

352
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:08,499
What kind of an ironborn

353
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:11,705
loses his senses during a storm?

354
00:42:13,516 --> 00:42:15,575
I am the storm, brother.

355
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,592
The first storm and the last.

356
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:21,895
And you're in my way.

357
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:03,938
Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves.

358
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:07,970
Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh.

359
00:43:08,443 --> 00:43:13,304
Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children.

360
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:15,815
What is dead may never die.

361
00:43:25,248 --> 00:43:27,102
I'm going to find out who did this.

362
00:43:27,786 --> 00:43:30,434
I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live.

363
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:34,517
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

364
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:37,738
The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon,

365
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:42,226
- not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.
- My father would have wanted me to rule.

366
00:43:42,226 --> 00:43:45,347
Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear.

367
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:49,504
Perhaps you'll win.

368
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:53,208
Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the ironborn.

369
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:56,001
And perhaps not.

370
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:14,512
Come in.

371
00:44:21,265 --> 00:44:24,036
I'm sorry, my lady. Didn't mean to interrupt.

372
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:26,505
You interrupt nothing.

373
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:41,319
I assume you know why I'm here.

374
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:44,640
I will after you tell me.

375
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,103
- It's about the Lord Commander.
- The former Lord Commander.

376
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,930
Does he have to be?

377
00:44:55,977 --> 00:44:57,279
What are you asking?

378
00:45:01,738 --> 00:45:05,711
Do you know of any magic...

379
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,401
that could help him?

380
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:13,008
- Bring him back?
- If you want to help him, leave him be.

381
00:45:13,008 --> 00:45:14,246
Can it be done?

382
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:18,898
- There are some with this power.
- How?

383
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:22,106
- I don't know.
- Have you seen it done?

384
00:45:25,593 --> 00:45:29,120
I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it--

385
00:45:31,551 --> 00:45:36,303
- it shouldn't have been possible.
- But it was. It could be now.

386
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:38,345
Not for me.

387
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:43,927
Not for you?

388
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:51,728
I saw you drink poison that should have killed you.

389
00:45:52,723 --> 00:45:55,146
I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.

390
00:45:55,146 --> 00:45:56,881
Everything I believed,

391
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,061
the great victory I saw in the flames,

392
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:02,941
all of it was a lie.

393
00:46:07,757 --> 00:46:09,410
You were right all along.

394
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,998
The Lord never spoke to me.

395
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:14,200
Fuck him, then.

396
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,503
Fuck all of them.

397
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:20,958
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

398
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:25,289
Seven gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same.

399
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:30,717
I'm not asking the Lord of Light for help.

400
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:35,557
I'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.

401
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:39,706
I never had this gift.

402
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,478
Have you ever tried?

403
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:27,073
Please.
