4
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,471
Yes?

5
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,182
For you, my lady.

6
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:25,137
How far is Mole's Town?

7
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:34,471
Sansa.

8
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,035
Lady Brienne.

9
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,462
When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.

10
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,355
You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.

11
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,515
Unharmed?

12
00:02:56,417 --> 00:03:00,693
What are you doing here? I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid.

13
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,951
They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak. To come to my aid?

14
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:12,071
Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot.

15
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,920
If you did know, you're my enemy.

16
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,448
Would you like to hear about our wedding night?

17
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:21,866
He never hurt my face.

18
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,964
He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

19
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:35,706
But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me

20
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:37,902
as long as I could still give him an heir.

21
00:03:41,786 --> 00:03:43,191
What do you think he did?

22
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,933
I can't begin to contemplate-- What do you think he did to me?

23
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:04,657
Lady Sansa asked you a question. He beat you.

24
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:07,380
Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?

25
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,022
- Sansa, I-- - What else?

26
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,893
Did he cut you?

27
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:19,022
- Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along. - I didn't know.

28
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:24,115
I thought you knew everyone's secrets. I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

29
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:25,840
I underestimated a stranger.

30
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,906
The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things,

31
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,670
but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time.

32
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,920
I can still feel it.

33
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.

34
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,690
I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.

35
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:51,573
I'm so sorry.

36
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:53,448
You said you would protect me.

37
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:57,013
And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.

38
00:04:57,013 --> 00:05:00,400
I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore.

39
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,115
You can't protect me.

40
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,328
You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down.

41
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:10,497
And why shouldn't I?

42
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:15,733
Do you want me to beg for my life?

43
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,302
If that's what you want, I will.

44
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,060
Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.

45
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,911
What if I want you to die here and now?

46
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,422
Then I will die.

47
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:37,070
You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family

48
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:41,368
and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family.

49
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,746
Go back to Moat Cailin.

50
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:49,377
My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.

51
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,222
I would do anything to undo what's been done to you.

52
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,640
I know that I can't.

53
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,768
Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go?

54
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:11,902
Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

55
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:17,653
You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.

56
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:20,275
I have an army. Your brother's army.

57
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:30,302
Half-brother.

58
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,342
You're not ready.

59
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,360
You should go home before it's too late.

60
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:06,364
You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.

61
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:23,182
She has a point.

62
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:32,933
None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies.

63
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:35,804
They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.

64
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:38,782
Who was the first? He was no one.

65
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,960
The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift.

66
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:48,408
The man taught others in exchange for their service.

67
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:51,831
Many served, many more gifts were given.

68
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:57,004
Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.

69
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,066
Where did they go? Here.

70
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:04,542
They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house.

71
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:10,702
These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others.

72
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,297
The first Faceless Men.

73
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,431
And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.

74
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,280
A girl has no desires.

75
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,270
Who?

76
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:43,066
An actress who calls herself Lady Crane.

77
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:45,520
She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square.

78
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,422
A girl has been given a second chance.

79
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,435
There will not be a third.

80
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:57,502
One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.

81
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:24,515
Oh, murdered by a boar.

82
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,226
The great big hairy whore.

83
00:10:27,431 --> 00:10:34,444
He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more.

84
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:37,511
Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie.

85
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,648
I love you, Father. Please don't die.

86
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:44,266
Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.

87
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:48,515
I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land.

88
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:53,626
And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand.

89
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:57,377
Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace?

90
00:10:57,608 --> 00:11:01,342
To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?

91
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:05,262
Ned Stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.

92
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,706
Ooh, what's happened here, then?

93
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:16,337
He brought you here, Ned Stark, 'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land.

94
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:20,275
You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.

95
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:24,568
We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.

96
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:28,746
I'd ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.

97
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:33,475
I die! I die!

98
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,702
And here I now must lie.

99
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:41,146
Oh, woe. Oh, no.

100
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:47,564
Oh, I am about to go.

101
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,524
Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand? The Iron Throne's what I demand.

102
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:53,706
- You cannot. - I can.

103
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:54,737
- You will not. - I will.

104
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,480
- You dare not. - I dare yes.

105
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,631
- The line of succession. - What's that mean?

106
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:00,551
- The proper progression. - What's that mean?

107
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:03,315
- The lawful ascension. - What's that mean?

108
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:20,524
So move along, give me my chair and there won't be no more trouble.

109
00:12:24,062 --> 00:12:26,862
But we had a deal all done and dusted.

110
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:30,071
I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.

111
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,662
Save my father. Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.

112
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:48,373
- Save him, please. - Show him mercy.

113
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:53,013
Show the people what a good king should be. Good people, you may all relax.

114
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:55,360
My father's friend shall be spared the--

115
00:12:57,848 --> 00:12:59,893
Father! No!

116
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:03,484
Oh, Father. Oh!

117
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:15,795
Worry not! All is well.

118
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:20,817
I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister,

119
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,880
the richest man you'll see.

120
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,715
He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position's mine for life.

121
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:32,400
And he's given me permission to take Sansa as my wife.

122
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:39,190
You'll learn that what I lack in height, I make up for in appetite.

123
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,920
So let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.

124
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,275
It's a wart. Two warts.

125
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:58,053
I've got two fucking warts on my cock.

126
00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:01,537
Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.

127
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:05,395
Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.

128
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:08,604
You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.

129
00:14:08,942 --> 00:14:10,480
I had two lines.

130
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,217
There are no small parts. You rang very false.

131
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:17,368
I rang very false? What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.

132
00:14:19,688 --> 00:14:23,822
You weren't complaining about me last night. May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?

133
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,973
I'm a rum girl, Bobono.

134
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,524
You need to know that if we're going to be intimate.

135
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:31,831
Of course we're going to be intimate. It's only a matter of time.

136
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:37,635
To our children.

137
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:41,751
May they have your talent. And your filthy mind.

138
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:53,120
A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.

139
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,100
If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall...

140
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,982
A girl is not ready.

141
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,066
She's a good actress.

142
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,146
So a man has heard.

143
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,506
Seems like a decent woman.

144
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:19,262
Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?

145
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,648
No.

146
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:28,204
Who wants her dead?

147
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:31,217
That does not matter. The price was paid.

148
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,693
The younger actress.

149
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,355
She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.

150
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:43,031
A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.

151
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,000
A girl has decided.

152
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,795
A servant does not ask questions.

153
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,768
No! No! No!

154
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,275
It was you.

155
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:30,826
You made the white walkers. We were at war.

156
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,306
We were being slaughtered.

157
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,635
Our sacred trees cut down.

158
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:38,737
We needed to defend ourselves.

159
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:42,337
From whom? From you.

160
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:44,995
From men.

161
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,146
We speak in the presence of the Drowned God.

162
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:03,022
In his name we gather today to choose a new king as our leader.

163
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,315
Who makes a claim?

164
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,737
I am Yara Greyjoy,

165
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:15,404
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

166
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:17,191
King of the Iron Islands.

167
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,120
I claim the Salt Throne.

168
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,733
We've never had a queen. Not once.

169
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,662
There are many things we've never done.

170
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:29,057
We've never made our mark upon the world.

171
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,862
The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind

172
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:37,626
until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance.

173
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,351
Then they swat us down.

174
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:43,320
They conquer us, humiliate us,

175
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,062
and go right back to forgetting we exist.

176
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,368
Aye!

177
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,568
- We are a sea people. - Aye!

178
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:53,422
- Our god is a sea god. - Aye!

179
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,809
When I am queen, we will build a fleet that--

180
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,591
- You shall not be queen! - I am not finished!

181
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:00,675
Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us.

182
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:03,688
Not when Balon's own male heir has returned.

183
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:32,870
I am Theon Greyjoy...

184
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:37,240
last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

185
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:48,942
And she is your rightful ruler. Aye!

186
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:53,093
Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here,

187
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:55,768
- you know what she is. - Aye!

188
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:57,777
- She is a reaver. - Aye!

189
00:19:57,777 --> 00:19:59,608
- She is a warrior. - Aye!

190
00:19:59,608 --> 00:20:02,071
She is ironborn! Aye!

191
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:05,040
We will find no better leader.

192
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:10,480
This is our queen.

193
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,510
Yara! Yara! Yara!

194
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,653
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

195
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,773
I claim the Salt Throne.

196
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:37,128
Niece.

197
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:40,284
Nephew.

198
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:43,288
Little Theon.

199
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,844
Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground.

200
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,035
Captured a castle you couldn't keep.

201
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:54,204
Got yourself taken prisoner.

202
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:57,724
Even heard you have no cock.

203
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:03,760
Explains why you think a woman can be king.

204
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,764
When did you return, Uncle? A few days ago.

205
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,053
I had some things to take care of.

206
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:11,795
Long overdue.

207
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:15,004
I'm glad you're here.

208
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:20,195
Now I know what my first act as queen will be.

209
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:24,044
To execute the man who killed my father.

210
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:33,280
I did. I killed him.

211
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:39,280
Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall.

212
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,840
He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me.

213
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:49,208
No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him.

214
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,688
He led us into two wars we couldn't win.

215
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:56,017
I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.

216
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:59,404
That would have been hard to do. You weren't here.

217
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:03,920
Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.

218
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,048
Gallivanting?

219
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:09,262
That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?

220
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,871
Did the great lords of Westeros teach you words like that?

221
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:17,200
You were gone. Yara was here.

222
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:20,266
Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.

223
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:25,022
Getting ready to bring us back to glory. And how will she do that?

224
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:29,297
I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.

225
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:35,831
Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet

226
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:38,151
because I'm the one who knows how to use it.

227
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:42,506
I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined.

228
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:50,311
And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do.

229
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:56,542
Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband.

230
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,635
I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over

231
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:05,457
and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.

232
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:08,248
You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?

233
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:11,653
I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

234
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:14,240
And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms.

235
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,217
I wasn't born to be king.

236
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:22,160
I paid the iron price and here I stand.

237
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:31,520
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

238
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,724
Euron! Euron!

239
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:49,786
May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were.

240
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:53,600
Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone.

241
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:58,657
Bless him with steel. Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.

242
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,600
He is speaking to us and he says

243
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:06,008
we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy.

244
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:10,337
Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away.

245
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:12,328
Let the old Euron drown.

246
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:15,244
Let his lungs fill with seawater.

247
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:24,257
Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.

248
00:24:24,444 --> 00:24:30,364
What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.

249
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:43,048
What is dead may never die.

250
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,528
Where are my niece and nephew?

251
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,391
Let's go murder them.

252
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880
They stole our best ships.

253
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:32,373
Won't be enough to save them.

254
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,902
Go back to your homes.

255
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,773
Chop down every tree you can find.

256
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,370
Quarter-saw the timber and start building.

257
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,884
I want every man bending planks.

258
00:26:44,008 --> 00:26:46,577
I want every woman spinning flax for sails.

259
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:52,142
Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.

260
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,328
I banished you twice.

261
00:27:15,407 --> 00:27:18,308
You came back twice.

262
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:23,540
And you saved my life.

263
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:32,604
So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.

264
00:27:34,977 --> 00:27:36,506
You must send me away.

265
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,626
Is there a cure? I don't know.

266
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:59,555
How long does it take? I don't know that either.

267
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:02,293
But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough.

268
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,395
I'll end things before that.

269
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:10,426
I'm sorry.

270
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:13,546
I'm so sorry.

271
00:28:13,546 --> 00:28:14,506
Don't be.

272
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,946
All I've ever wanted was to serve you.

273
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:23,760
Tyrion Lannister was right.

274
00:28:26,986 --> 00:28:27,928
I love you.

275
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:35,422
I'll always love you.

276
00:28:40,657 --> 00:28:41,893
Good-bye, khaleesi.

277
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:51,431
Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal.

278
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:56,124
You have not been dismissed.

279
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,142
You pledged yourself to me.

280
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:03,973
You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.

281
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:11,582
Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world.

282
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:19,960
I command you to heal yourself and then return to me.

283
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:28,248
When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.

284
00:30:07,653 --> 00:30:11,182
In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters,

285
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,364
how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?

286
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:19,066
None. And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men?

287
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,102
Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing.

288
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:26,808
So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.

289
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:30,026
For now. For now is the best we get in our profession.

290
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:31,200
It's not enough.

291
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:35,030
Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start.

292
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:37,440
It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.

293
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:40,640
They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it.

294
00:30:40,986 --> 00:30:45,582
The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders.

295
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,848
Our queen has an even better story.

296
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:52,844
Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and all that.

297
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:55,235
The people know who brought them freedom.

298
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:57,608
Yes, but do they know who brought them security?

299
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,000
Who brought about an end to the violence?

300
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:02,488
We need someone the people trust,

301
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:06,124
someone they know cannot be bought or influenced.

302
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:09,244
Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?

303
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,306
Who said anything about "him"?

304
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,885
YOU STAND IN...

305
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,681
HIGH PRIESTESS OF...

306
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:21,433
THE FLEME...

307
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:22,851
THE LIGHT OF...

308
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:26,771
THE FIRST...

309
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:36,448
WELCOME...

310
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:40,631
That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

311
00:31:47,226 --> 00:31:49,288
Thank you for travelling all this way.

312
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:53,580
I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.

313
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:01,360
The truth is we need your help.

314
00:32:01,946 --> 00:32:04,764
We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to--

315
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:08,213
You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.

316
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:11,946
Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised.

317
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,831
From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.

318
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:17,431
Yes.

319
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:23,173
She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.

320
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,360
She did indeed.

321
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:30,888
Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light.

322
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:33,528
But you heard all of this before, haven't you?

323
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:36,097
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

324
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:41,831
The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands,

325
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,302
burning their sins and flesh away.

326
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:48,995
Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers.

327
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:52,462
The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.

328
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:55,208
You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed.

329
00:32:55,893 --> 00:33:00,124
And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.

330
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:02,906
I'd settle for obeyed.

331
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:06,257
I will summon my most eloquent priests.

332
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:08,640
They will spread the word.

333
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:13,066
Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness

334
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:17,306
in this war and in the great war still to come.

335
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:18,373
That sounds most excellent.

336
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:24,684
A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses.

337
00:33:24,897 --> 00:33:27,617
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

338
00:33:27,946 --> 00:33:33,191
He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me.

339
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:35,893
Last I had heard, he had been defeated again,

340
00:33:35,893 --> 00:33:40,071
this time at Winterfell and this time for good.

341
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,120
We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.

342
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,533
I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake.

343
00:33:46,746 --> 00:33:49,608
Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic?

344
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,060
You're always right.

345
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:55,004
Everything is the Lord's will.

346
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,884
Everything is the Lord's will.

347
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,484
But men and women make mistakes.

348
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,964
Even honest servants of the Lord.

349
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:07,315
And you, an honest servant of the Lord,

350
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:12,328
why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?

351
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:14,951
My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,

352
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:18,071
but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.

353
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:27,368
Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason.

354
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,240
Terrible things happen for a reason.

355
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:36,346
Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child.

356
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,697
If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,

357
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:46,791
you wouldn't be here helping the Lord's Chosen bring his light into the world.

358
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:50,631
Knowledge has made you powerful.

359
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:54,844
But there's still so much you don't know.

360
00:34:56,924 --> 00:35:03,448
Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire?

361
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:08,942
You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember?

362
00:35:11,537 --> 00:35:13,857
Should I tell you what the voice said?

363
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:19,084
Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?

364
00:35:28,764 --> 00:35:30,453
We serve the same queen.

365
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:35,591
If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.

366
00:37:25,502 --> 00:37:26,471
What?

367
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:12,977
He saw me, the Night King!

368
00:39:12,977 --> 00:39:15,128
- He saw me! - He touched you.

369
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,764
I don't know. He was close, but--

370
00:39:18,764 --> 00:39:19,964
He touched you.

371
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:25,160
He knows you are here. He'll come for you.

372
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,013
But he can't get in.

373
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,300
He can now. His mark is on you.

374
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,560
You must leave, all of you.

375
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,435
Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.

376
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,448
Hodor.

377
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:42,604
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

378
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:45,671
- The time has come. - The time for what?

379
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,450
For you to become me.

380
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:52,595
But am I ready?

381
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,746
No.

382
00:39:57,173 --> 00:40:01,511
We can't defend the north from the walkers and the south from the Boltons.

383
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:05,733
If we want to survive, we need Winterfell and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

384
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,320
Aside from the Starks and the Boltons,

385
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,075
the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks,

386
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:18,417
and the Manderlys.

387
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:23,680
The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons,

388
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,271
so we're not doing so well there.

389
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:28,373
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang.

390
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:33,253
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.

391
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,648
I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father.

392
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:40,710
I don't think we can count on them either.

393
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:44,995
How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?

394
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:49,351
Precious little, my lady. My father always said Northerners are different.

395
00:40:49,351 --> 00:40:52,782
More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.

396
00:40:52,782 --> 00:40:58,515
They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family?

397
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:03,132
I may not know the North, but I know men.

398
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,831
They're more or less the same in any corner of the world

399
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:12,382
and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause.

400
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,902
If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him,

401
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,991
they need to believe it's a fight they can win.

402
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:20,337
There are more than three other houses in the North--

403
00:41:20,337 --> 00:41:25,022
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood.

404
00:41:25,022 --> 00:41:28,568
Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others.

405
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:32,888
We can start small and build. The North remembers.

406
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:34,817
They remember the Stark name.

407
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:39,200
People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

408
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,551
I don't doubt it.

409
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:44,942
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name. No, but I do.

410
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:53,040
Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

411
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:55,360
And there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern,

412
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,250
but they will back us against the Boltons without question.

413
00:41:58,275 --> 00:42:00,257
I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

414
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:03,386
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.

415
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,431
How do you know that?

416
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:09,848
Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.

417
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:15,431
That's good. The Blackfish is a legend.

418
00:42:15,608 --> 00:42:17,377
His support would mean a great deal.

419
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,404
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

420
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:23,777
almost starts to look like a winning side.

421
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:28,177
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

422
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:32,000
You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.

423
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,564
We can send the Blackfish a raven. Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.

424
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:36,835
It has to be you.

425
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,546
Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.

426
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,475
What is it?

427
00:42:47,715 --> 00:42:50,577
I don't like leaving you here alone. With Jon?

428
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,475
Not him. He seems trustworthy.

429
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,768
A bit brooding, perhaps.

430
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:58,053
I suppose that's understandable, considering.

431
00:42:59,706 --> 00:43:00,906
The others, though.

432
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:09,324
Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with bloodmagic.

433
00:43:09,475 --> 00:43:11,893
And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they?

434
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:15,297
Already out looking for a leader with better prospects.

435
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:19,911
And that wildling fellow with the beard-- Jon isn't Tormund.

436
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:24,168
Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.

437
00:43:25,288 --> 00:43:28,240
He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him.

438
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:35,182
Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?

439
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,520
New dress?

440
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:48,426
I made it myself. Do you like it?

441
00:43:48,755 --> 00:43:51,911
Yeah, it's-- I like the wolf bit.

442
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:57,244
Good, because I made this for you.

443
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:01,964
I made it like the one Father used to wear.

444
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:04,764
As near as I can remember.

445
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:09,982
Thank you, Sansa. You're welcome.

446
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:32,684
Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

447
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,266
I'll do my best.

448
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,733
Good luck.

449
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:16,050
Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?

450
00:45:16,373 --> 00:45:17,884
I'm not the Lord Comman--

451
00:45:23,128 --> 00:45:27,066
yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.

452
00:45:39,217 --> 00:45:40,808
We can go home now, Hodor.

453
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:43,448
Well, maybe not home home,

454
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:45,760
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

455
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,200
Hodor.

456
00:45:47,386 --> 00:45:49,208
Eat something that isn't moss.

457
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,320
I want an egg. How do you like 'em?

458
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:57,208
Boiled? Fried up with some butter?

459
00:45:57,617 --> 00:45:58,515
Hodor.

460
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:02,320
With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.

461
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,422
Hodor.

462
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:05,928
Get Bran and run!

463
00:47:18,426 --> 00:47:20,497
Bran. Bran, wake up.

464
00:47:20,782 --> 00:47:23,440
- Bran. - Hodor. Hodor.

465
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:24,897
Bran, wake up.

466
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,591
- Gods keep you on the kingsroad. - Take it easy.

467
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:38,720
Watch yourself.

468
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,413
Hodor.

469
00:47:43,413 --> 00:47:45,591
Hodor. Hodor.

470
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,760
Help me!

471
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,420
Go!

472
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:10,524
Go!

473
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,640
Remember that you are a Stark.

474
00:49:00,844 --> 00:49:05,564
Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.

475
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:06,640
Yes, Father.

476
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,071
But if you have to fight, win.

477
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,346
Bran! Bran, wake up!

478
00:49:28,586 --> 00:49:31,733
Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.

479
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:33,991
