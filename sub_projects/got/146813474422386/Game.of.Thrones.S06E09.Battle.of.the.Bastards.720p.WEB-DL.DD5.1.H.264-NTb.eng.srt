

4
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,370
Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.

5
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:39,368
Perhaps we should take shelter.

6
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,515
The city's on the rise?

7
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:46,613
Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets.

8
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:47,982
The people are behind you.

9
00:02:51,146 --> 00:02:56,195
Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people.

10
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:59,555
But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence.

11
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:04,808
The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.

12
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:08,213
Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery,

13
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,937
a city without Masters...

14
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:14,160
...it proves that no one needs a Master.

15
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,168
Good.

16
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:20,728
Shall we begin?

17
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:23,911
Do we have a plan?

18
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,168
I will crucify the Masters.

19
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,186
I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers,

20
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:34,791
and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.

21
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:38,515
You don't approve?

22
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:41,360
You once told me you knew what your father was.

23
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:46,302
Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?

24
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,462
Probably not.

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,088
Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me.

26
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,902
He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep,

27
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:02,320
the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares.

28
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:06,737
He would have burned every one of his citizens.

29
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,475
The loyal ones and the traitors. Every man, woman, and child.

30
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,542
That's why Jaime killed him. This is entirely different.

31
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:18,844
You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different.

32
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,751
I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.

33
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,124
Once before, I offered you peace.

34
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:45,164
If you had not been so arrogant,

35
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:48,586
you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships.

36
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:57,288
Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.

37
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:02,391
We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.

38
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,666
The terms are simple.

39
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:09,502
You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.

40
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:14,977
The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.

41
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,906
The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder.

42
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:24,631
The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.

43
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,311
We obviously didn't communicate clearly.

44
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,680
We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.

45
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,213
I imagine it's difficult adjusting to the new reality.

46
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,555
Your reign is over.

47
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,115
My reign has just begun.

48
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,551
Dracarys.

49
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,484
Your men have a choice:

50
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:24,492
fight and die for masters who would never fight and die for you,

51
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:28,204
or go home to your families.

52
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:36,337
Thank you for the armada.

53
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:38,400
Our queen does love ships.

54
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:42,880
Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.

55
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,404
You violated that pact.

56
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,360
You declared war upon us.

57
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,084
Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.

58
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,444
Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.

59
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:04,817
It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?

60
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,826
Him. He should die.

61
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:11,297
Yes, him. He's not one of us.

62
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:14,408
He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us.

63
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:19,466
Please.

64
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:22,791
Please.

65
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,697
Tell your people what happened here.

66
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,382
Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty.

67
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:51,493
When they come forward with notions of retribution

68
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:54,888
or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory,

69
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,360
remind them what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.

70
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:41,324
You don't have to be here. Yes, I do.

71
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:08,044
My beloved wife.

72
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,693
I've missed you terribly.

73
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,057
Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely.

74
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,266
Now, dismount and kneel before me,

75
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,057
surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

76
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,537
I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch.

77
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:33,368
I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house.

78
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,524
Come, bastard,

79
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,320
you don't have the men, you don't have the horses,

80
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:44,115
and you don't have Winterfell.

81
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,920
Why lead those poor souls into slaughter?

82
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,804
There's no need for a battle.

83
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:53,875
Get off your horse and kneel.

84
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:57,306
I'm a man of mercy.

85
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:06,408
You're right. There's no need for a battle.

86
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:10,480
Thousands of men don't need to die.

87
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,000
Only one of us.

88
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:20,684
Let's end this the old way. You against me.

89
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,551
I keep hearing stories about you, bastard.

90
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,568
The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked.

91
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,920
Maybe you are that good. Maybe not.

92
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:52,177
I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours.

93
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:57,982
I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that?

94
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,253
Not even? Aye, you have the numbers.

95
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:06,577
Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?

96
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:18,616
He's good. Very good.

97
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:24,444
Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?

98
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:26,266
How do we know you have him?

99
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,053
Now, if you want to save... You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

100
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,377
Sleep well.

101
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:12,213
She's a fine woman, your sister.

102
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,457
I look forward to having her back in my bed.

103
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,271
And you're all fine-looking men.

104
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,364
My dogs are desperate to meet you.

105
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:27,075
I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous.

106
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:30,320
I wonder which parts they'll try first.

107
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:31,973
Your eyes?

108
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,088
Your balls?

109
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,804
We'll find out soon enough.

110
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,395
In the morning, then, bastard.

111
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:04,542
If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

112
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,608
That's not his way. He knows the North is watching.

113
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:12,097
If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him.

114
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:15,191
He can't have that. Fear is his power.

115
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:18,017
It's his weakness, too. His men don't want to fight for him.

116
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:20,551
They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...

117
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:23,911
It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses.

118
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:29,831
I know what mounted knights can do to us. You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.

119
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:32,124
We're digging trenches all along our flanks.

120
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,840
They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.

121
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,262
A pincer move.

122
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:50,426
They won't be able to hit us from the sides. Good.

123
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,417
It's crucial that we let them charge at us.

124
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:00,124
They've got the numbers, we need the patience.

125
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,893
If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue.

126
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:09,137
Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.

127
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,582
Did you really think that cunt would fight you man-to-man?

128
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:18,311
No. But I wanted to make him angry.

129
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:23,262
I want him coming at us full tilt.

130
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,702
We should all get some sleep.

131
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,888
Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.

132
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,928
So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.

133
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,866
Aye, for what they're worth.

134
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,964
You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors,

135
00:17:55,964 --> 00:18:00,728
and you sit around making your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know.

136
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,275
I lived with him. I know the way his mind works.

137
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:06,728
I know how he likes to hurt people.

138
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:11,911
Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?

139
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:14,933
You're right.

140
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,102
You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

141
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:24,120
- He's overconfident. - He plays with people.

142
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:26,746
He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.

143
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:29,875
Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks?

144
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:33,555
I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton.

145
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:36,266
I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

146
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,488
You don't know him.

147
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,502
All right, tell me.

148
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,493
What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?

149
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:49,050
We'll never get him back.

150
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,342
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

151
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:57,351
which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

152
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:01,342
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested,

153
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:05,324
which means he won't live long.

154
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,299
We can't give up on our brother.

155
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,684
Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.

156
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:13,768
Of course he does. What should I do differently?

157
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:15,742
I don't know! I don't know anything about battles.

158
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:19,697
Just don't do what he wants you to do.

159
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:20,959
Aye, that's good advice.

160
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,502
You think that's obvious? Well, it is a bit obvious.

161
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:24,960
If you had asked for my advice earlier,

162
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,120
I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we had a larger force, or is that obvious, too?

163
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,688
When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us.

164
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:37,031
The Blackfish can't help us. We're lucky to have this many men.

165
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:40,586
- It's not enough! - No, it's not enough. It's what we have!

166
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,004
Battles have been won against greater odds.

167
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:59,075
If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive.

168
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,604
Do you understand me?

169
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,573
I won't let ever let him touch you again.

170
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,568
I'll protect you, I promise.

171
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,160
No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.

172
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,595
You think there's hope?

173
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,626
I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight.

174
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:46,275
And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope.

175
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:51,431
You want to avenge your king, don't you?

176
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,533
It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.

177
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:58,640
It was Stannis himself. I loved the man.

178
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,040
He lifted me up and made me something.

179
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,782
But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.

180
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:06,835
- You saw these demons? - What?

181
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,408
No, it's a manner of speaking.

182
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:15,546
Not... actual demons.

183
00:21:18,231 --> 00:21:22,453
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned.

184
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,800
Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

185
00:21:24,924 --> 00:21:28,410
He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch.

186
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:30,515
I believed in him.

187
00:21:31,146 --> 00:21:33,973
I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night.

188
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:36,764
But I was wrong just like you.

189
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,177
Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.

190
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:46,026
Jon Snow's not a king.

191
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:49,440
No, he's not.

192
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,373
I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight.

193
00:21:57,102 --> 00:21:58,008
You want some?

194
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,853
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

195
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:05,493
stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.

196
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:09,208
No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head.

197
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,515
I can never sleep the night before a battle. So what do you do all night?

198
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:15,564
I walk.

199
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,662
Think and walk.

200
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:22,966
Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.

201
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,124
Happy shitting.

202
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:41,380
My lady.

203
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,644
You weren't at the war council.

204
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,120
I'm not a soldier.

205
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:53,884
Any advice?

206
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,746
Don't lose.

207
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:05,262
If I do, if I fall...

208
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:09,102
don't bring me back.

209
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:14,551
I'll have to try. I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

210
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:18,382
I am not your servant, Jon Snow. You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

211
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:20,151
I serve the Lord of Light.

212
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:23,662
I do what he commands.

213
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:25,288
How do you know what he commands?

214
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,844
I interpret his signs...

215
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:31,866
as well as I can.

216
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:38,915
If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back?

217
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:41,635
I have no power.

218
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:45,466
Only what he gives me and he gave me you.

219
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:48,595
Why?

220
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,271
I don't know.

221
00:23:56,764 --> 00:24:00,302
Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else.

222
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:03,724
Maybe he brought you here to die again.

223
00:24:08,977 --> 00:24:11,120
What kind of god would do something like that?

224
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,942
The one we've got.

225
00:26:05,662 --> 00:26:08,213
Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes?

226
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,631
You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall.

227
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:19,573
Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height

228
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,942
thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.

229
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:28,293
"The height of nobility," "a man of your stature," "someone to look up to."

230
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:32,222
You're all making the same five or six jokes.

231
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:34,426
- It was a long time ago. - It was.

232
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,875
And how have things been going for you since then?

233
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,453
Not so well, I gather.

234
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:45,351
Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.

235
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:50,230
I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.

236
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,586
And he paid for them. Doesn't seem like it.

237
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,853
He's still alive.

238
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:58,862
It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell.

239
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,026
Never quite knowing who you were.

240
00:27:03,093 --> 00:27:06,195
But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?

241
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:10,124
You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them.

242
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:15,048
In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?

243
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:17,217
Not my claim. Hers.

244
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,004
And what's wrong with you? I'm not fit to rule.

245
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:24,880
We can agree upon that at least. Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?

246
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:26,533
No more than Westeros.

247
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:32,346
Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.

248
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:35,484
He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

249
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,408
He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.

250
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,773
Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.

251
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:44,604
You and I have that in common.

252
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,053
We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.

253
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:52,862
Will their ships be enough?

254
00:27:53,324 --> 00:27:55,937
With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.

255
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:57,368
Barely.

256
00:27:59,031 --> 00:28:01,404
There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.

257
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:03,822
There are and Euron is building more.

258
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:06,960
He's going to offer them to you. So why shouldn't I wait for him?

259
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,217
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

260
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:11,786
He also wants to give you...

261
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:15,137
His big cock, I think he said.

262
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,791
Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see.

263
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:24,000
You won't get one without the other. And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?

264
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:26,577
I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.

265
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,924
He murdered our father and would have murdered us.

266
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:34,008
He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.

267
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:36,506
The Seven Kingdoms. All of them.

268
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:38,924
And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

269
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:42,400
Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands.

270
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,982
We ask you to give them back. And that's all?

271
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:51,057
We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

272
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:52,026
Reasonable.

273
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:57,377
What if everyone starts demanding their independence?

274
00:28:57,377 --> 00:29:01,911
She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well.

275
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:09,324
Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.

276
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,248
They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that.

277
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,173
We're going to leave the world better than we found it.

278
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,568
You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms

279
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:25,724
and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms.

280
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,595
No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.

281
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:33,315
That's our way of life.

282
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:34,382
No more.

283
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,742
No more.

284
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:30,746
Do you like games, little man?

285
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,164
Let's play a game.

286
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:38,515
Run to your brother.

287
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:42,542
The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him again.

288
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,782
That's it. That's the game.

289
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,924
Easy.

290
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,093
Ready?

291
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,297
Go.

292
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:01,466
No, you have to run, remember?

293
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:04,346
Those are the rules.

294
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,151
Don't.

295
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:17,031
Prepare to charge.

296
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:20,640
Prepare to charge!

297
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,231
- Draw! - Draw!

298
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:25,848
Draw!

299
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,893
Loose!

300
00:36:35,413 --> 00:36:38,150
Go! Go! Follow your commander!

301
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,137
Run and fight!

302
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,284
Nock!

303
00:37:15,617 --> 00:37:17,786
- Draw! - Draw!

304
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,626
- Loose! - Loose!

305
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:30,520
Now.

306
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:34,906
Cavalry, charge!

307
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,720
- Nock! - Nock!

308
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:32,480
- Nock! - Nock!

309
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:37,066
- Draw! - Draw!

310
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,555
- Draw! - Draw!

311
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,262
We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.

312
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,440
- Loose! - Loose!

313
00:39:27,955 --> 00:39:29,164
Get word...

314
00:39:49,173 --> 00:39:50,088
No!

315
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:06,142
Loose!

316
00:40:21,893 --> 00:40:24,017
- Loose! - Loose!

317
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:33,742
- Loose! - Loose!

318
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:07,973
We may as well be taking shits back here. Follow!

319
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:17,511
It's time, go.

320
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:22,640
- Who owns the North? - We do!

321
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:25,217
- Who owns the North? - We do!

322
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:26,702
Show me!

323
00:42:55,377 --> 00:42:58,293
Infantry, advance!

324
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,893
With me, lads! Break their line!

325
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:08,924
Help me!

326
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:39,146
- Tormund! - Get him back!

327
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:42,320
Infantry, advance.

328
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,826
Both sides!

329
00:44:49,475 --> 00:44:51,360
Fall back!

330
00:44:52,204 --> 00:44:54,364
Fall back!

331
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:17,368
Fuck this, come on!

332
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:29,102
We're going home!

333
00:49:45,475 --> 00:49:47,288
Open the gate!

334
00:49:52,586 --> 00:49:54,897
Archers to the wall.

335
00:49:57,004 --> 00:49:59,351
- Their army's gone. - Our army's gone.

336
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,822
We have Winterfell.

337
00:50:02,471 --> 00:50:05,190
They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.

338
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:07,928
Archers! To the wall!

339
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,786
You suggested one-on-one combat, didn't you?

340
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:55,146
I've reconsidered.

341
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,111
I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.

342
00:53:59,831 --> 00:54:03,688
We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.

343
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,555
Jon.

344
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,093
Where is he?

345
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,240
Sansa.

346
00:54:54,506 --> 00:54:56,186
Hello, Sansa.

347
00:55:04,275 --> 00:55:06,382
Is this where I'll be staying now?

348
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,044
No.

349
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:24,657
Our time together is about to come to an end.

350
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:28,764
That's all right.

351
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:31,760
You can't kill me.

352
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,146
I'm part of you now.

353
00:55:38,542 --> 00:55:40,613
Your words will disappear.

354
00:55:43,617 --> 00:55:46,071
Your house will disappear.

355
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:49,342
Your name will disappear.

356
00:55:51,493 --> 00:55:53,777
All memory of you will disappear.

357
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,848
My hounds will never harm me.

358
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:27,724
You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.

359
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,760
They're loyal beasts.

360
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,324
They were. Now they're starving.

361
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,004
Sit.

362
00:57:03,804 --> 00:57:06,622
Down. Down!

363
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,346
Down! Down! Down!
