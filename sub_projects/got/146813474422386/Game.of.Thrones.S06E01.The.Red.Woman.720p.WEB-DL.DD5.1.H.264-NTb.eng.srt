
4
00:03:27,603 --> 00:03:29,251
It's coming from the courtyard.

5
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,133
It's the Lord Commander!

6
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:44,959
TRAITOR

7
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:51,773
Help me get him inside.

8
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:49,021
Thorne did this.

9
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:56,407
How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?

10
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,443
Trust?

11
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,144
The men in this room.

12
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,502
Does the wolf know you?

13
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,019
We need all the help we can get.

14
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:16,703
Ser Davos.

15
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:04,002
I saw him in the flames fighting at Winterfell.

16
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:10,538
I can't speak for the flames...

17
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:13,597
but he's gone.

18
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:38,247
- He was our Lord Commander.
- He never should have been!

19
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,864
You all know why you're here.

20
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,770
- Jon Snow is dead.
- Who killed him?

21
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,250
I did.

22
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:58,710
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.

23
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,713
- Murderers! - Traitors!

24
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:05,842
You're right!

25
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,690
We've committed treason, all of us.

26
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:11,744
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

27
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,580
I had no love for him.

28
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:16,530
That was no secret.

29
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,119
But I never once disobeyed an order.

30
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:26,294
Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night's Watch is built.

31
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:29,000
And the Watch means everything to me.

32
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,811
I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night's Watch.

33
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:42,193
Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch.

34
00:07:42,193 --> 00:07:47,933
He let the wildlings through our gates as no Lord Commander has ever done before.

35
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:55,442
He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered.

36
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,624
Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I've no doubt about that.

37
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:08,730
And what he thought was right would have been the end of us.

38
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,305
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

39
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:14,152
And we made it.

40
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,205
He'll have seen we didn't come. Thorne will have made it official by now.

41
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:35,116
- Castle Black is his.
- I don't care who's sitting at the high table.

42
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,663
Jon was my friend.

43
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,029
And those fuckers butchered him.

44
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:44,825
- Now we return the favor.
- We don't have the numbers.

45
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,388
- We have a direwolf. - It's not enough.

46
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,471
I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long,

47
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:52,498
but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing.

48
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,895
If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room.

49
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,886
We all die today.

50
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,631
I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go.

51
00:09:02,631 --> 00:09:05,654
We need to fight, but we don't need to die.

52
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:08,145
- Not if we have help. - Who is gonna help us?

53
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:11,425
You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

54
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:22,979
Bolt the door. Don't let anyone in.

55
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:25,233
I'll be back as soon as I can.

56
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,295
She was 11 the first time I saw her.

57
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,205
The kennelmaster's daughter.

58
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:47,751
She smelled of dog.

59
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,824
I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me.

60
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,223
You certainly were.

61
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,981
Myranda wasn't, though.

62
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,174
What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't?

63
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:13,911
She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn't do.

64
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:23,732
Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over.

65
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,258
I wish you could be here to watch.

66
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,348
Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord?

67
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:41,697
Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

68
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:48,519
Buried, burned?

69
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:52,201
This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.

70
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,234
Your command of the cavalry was impressive.

71
00:10:57,595 --> 00:11:00,473
Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead.

72
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,827
Do you know who struck the killing blow?

73
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:06,372
- No. - A shame. I'd reward the man.

74
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,829
Still, a great victory.

75
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,395
Do you feel like a victor?

76
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:21,878
I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark.

77
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:26,634
Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons

78
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:30,262
is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?

79
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:34,216
No.

80
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:41,457
A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North.

81
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:45,048
They won't back us without Sansa Stark.

82
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:50,910
We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her.

83
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:54,898
You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

84
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:57,952
I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds.

85
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,671
- They won't get far.
- I'm glad to hear it.

86
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,488
Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir.

87
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,056
And without an heir, well...

88
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,930
let's hope the maesters are right and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

89
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:37,094
We can't stop.

90
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:57,833
We have to cross here.

91
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:03,449
- I can't. - It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

92
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,423
But it's too cold. I can't. I won't make it. I'll die.

93
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:10,456
I've seen what his hounds do to a person. This way is better.

94
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:45,124
Over here. Come on.

95
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:01,932
Sansa.

96
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:04,598
Sansa.

97
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,975
Tell them to settle down!

98
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,900
Stay here. I'll lure them away.

99
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,925
- No, I won't make it without you.
- You will.

100
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:38,569
Go north, only north. Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black.

101
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:40,297
He'll help you.

102
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,647
See somebody, eh?

103
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,600
- There they are! - Get them!

104
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,273
Where is Lady Bolton?

105
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,373
- Dead. - Liar.

106
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,602
She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts.

107
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,699
I left her to die in the snow.

108
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,574
Got something! Run!

109
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:30,242
Resist. Stay.

110
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,582
Stay.

111
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:37,914
I can't wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.

112
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,358
Rider! Who is it?

113
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:50,524
It's a bloody woman.

114
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:01,060
No! Please! NO

115
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:57,399
Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again.

116
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:03,513
I will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be.

117
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:07,335
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

118
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:18,796
And I vow...

119
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:25,903
that you shall always have a place by my hearth and...

120
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,547
- Meat and mead at my table.
- ...meat and mead at my table.

121
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:41,819
And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor.

122
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,533
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

123
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,574
Arise.

124
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:39,681
Your Grace, I'm sorry to disturb you. A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor.

125
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,627
Myrcella.

126
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,466
Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?

127
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:01,459
Mother.

128
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:08,009
All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now.

129
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:17,115
Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now?

130
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:21,703
Has she started to bloat?

131
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,825
Has her skin turned black?

132
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,979
Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?

133
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,310
I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.

134
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:43,141
I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.

135
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,160
Don't think about it.

136
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,510
I have to.

137
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:54,170
- I have to. It's not right she has to suffer alone.
- She's not suffering. She's gone.

138
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:57,343
No one can hurt her anymore.

139
00:21:59,702 --> 00:22:01,185
She was good.

140
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,654
From her first breath, she was so sweet.

141
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:09,426
I don't know where she came from.

142
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:13,254
She was nothing like me.

143
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:17,856
- No meanness, no jealousy, just good.
- I know.

144
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,264
I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...

145
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,031
- maybe I'm not a monster. - Listen-- listen to me.

146
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:35,670
- She was my daughter and I failed her.
- No, I knew this would happen.

147
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:38,446
The witch told me years ago.

148
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,305
She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.

149
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,584
"And gold their shrouds."

150
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:49,620
Everything she said came true. You couldn't have stopped it.

151
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:51,414
It's prophecy. It's fate.

152
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:53,851
- You don't believe that. - Of course I do.

153
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,417
You told me yourself when Father died.

154
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:03,379
You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours.

155
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,067
That was a prophecy, too. I didn't listen to you and everything you said came true.

156
00:23:07,349 --> 00:23:11,600
Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn't us.

157
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:15,515
We're the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world.

158
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:19,562
And everything they've taken from us, we're going to take back and more.

159
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,822
We're going to take everything there is.

160
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,579
"The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men.

161
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:41,085
They scream in agony and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames,

162
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:46,579
for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved."

163
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:48,459
I'd like to see my brother.

164
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,910
- Confess. - Please.

165
00:23:51,635 --> 00:23:54,502
- How is he? At least tell me that.
- Confess.

166
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:00,808
I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.

167
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:05,173
Sinners don't make demands. They make confessions.

168
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:10,612
Septa Unella.

169
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,616
Our other guests need you.

170
00:24:26,043 --> 00:24:27,069
There.

171
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,516
Septa Unella can be overzealous at times.

172
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:34,125
I'll speak with her.

173
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,770
My brother, can you tell me how he is?

174
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:44,505
It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here.

175
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,900
Your husband misses you dearly.

176
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:51,521
The love between a man and wife is sacred.

177
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:55,455
It reflects the love the gods have for all of us.

178
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:59,290
But sin leads us away from the sacred.

179
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:02,957
And only confession can purge sin.

180
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,740
I have nothing to confess.

181
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,438
So you believe you are pure?

182
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,523
Perfect?

183
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:13,865
Wholly without sin?

184
00:25:15,865 --> 00:25:17,196
None of us are.

185
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,429
You have started down the path.

186
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:25,579
But you have many miles to go.

187
00:25:39,656 --> 00:25:41,672
I always envied Oberyn.

188
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:45,615
He lived. He truly lived.

189
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:49,895
Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country.

190
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:52,089
Lay with the most beautiful women alive.

191
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,027
- And men. - And men.

192
00:25:54,367 --> 00:26:00,123
He experienced everything while I sat here in Dorne

193
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:04,036
trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed.

194
00:26:05,123 --> 00:26:06,669
But that is life.

195
00:26:08,414 --> 00:26:10,284
We each have our roles.

196
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:14,800
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

197
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:19,822
- And I was born to rule.
- The gods are not fools.

198
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:21,957
You would have been a lousy adventurer.

199
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,111
And Oberyn, pfft,

200
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:27,012
he would have been a terrible ruler.

201
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:30,579
Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?

202
00:26:30,892 --> 00:26:32,017
Prince Doran.

203
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,025
The Princess Myrcella.

204
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:10,208
When was the last time you left this palace? You don't know your own people.

205
00:27:10,827 --> 00:27:12,611
Their disgust for you.

206
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:16,981
Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing.

207
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:21,772
Oberyn Martell butchered, and you did nothing.

208
00:27:23,652 --> 00:27:25,277
You're not a Dornishman.

209
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:28,918
You're not our prince.

210
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:33,897
My son Trystane...

211
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,729
Your son is weak just like you.

212
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,409
And weak men will never rule Dorne again.

213
00:28:05,463 --> 00:28:07,316
I told you I'm not hungry.

214
00:28:07,932 --> 00:28:09,616
We're not here to feed you.

215
00:28:12,554 --> 00:28:13,983
We're here to kill you.

216
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,461
You want her to do it or me?

217
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:20,147
We are family. I don't want to hurt you.

218
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:23,634
Her or me?

219
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:30,993
- You.
- Good.

220
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:32,762
Smart boy.

221
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,499
You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

222
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,396
We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.

223
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,334
We'll be fine.

224
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:10,882
We're dressed like common merchants.

225
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,524
You walk like a rich person.

226
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,552
You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?

227
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:22,184
You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property.

228
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:27,392
- I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
- It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore.

229
00:29:29,331 --> 00:29:30,946
Because you have no cock.

230
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:43,903
FOR YOUR BABY.

231
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,519
TO EAT.

232
00:29:46,097 --> 00:29:47,221
TO EAT.

233
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,358
She thinks you want to eat her baby.

234
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:55,059
HIS VALYRIAN IS TERRIBLE.

235
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,848
HE ONLY WANTS TO GIVE YOU MONEY,

236
00:29:57,848 --> 00:30:01,925
SO YOUR BABY CAN EAT.

237
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,014
KILL THE MASTERS
MHYSA IS A MASTER

238
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:18,598
- Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
- I know what mhysa means.

239
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:21,026
- Who wrote it? - Hard to know.

240
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:24,309
Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.

241
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:27,213
- The Sons of the Harpy?
- Very possibly.

242
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:32,358
Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property,

243
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:35,692
told them human beings weren't even property to begin with.

244
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:38,763
You can see why they're unhappy.

245
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:44,028
Of course, it could also be the freed men.

246
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:47,296
FOR THE NIGHT IS DARK AND FULL OF TERRORS.

247
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,686
THE LORD OF LIGHT SENT THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS TO YOU,

248
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:55,265
AND THOSE WHO LOVE THE DARKNESS CHASED HER AWAY.

249
00:30:55,265 --> 00:30:58,195
Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.

250
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:02,122
She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.

251
00:31:02,454 --> 00:31:04,375
HOW WILL YOU RESPOND?

252
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:10,309
WILL YOU WRING YOUR HAND, WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS TO RETURN?

253
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:14,258
OR WILL YOU TAKE UP HER FLAMES YOURSELVES?

254
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:19,546
WILL YOU FIGHT ROF YOUR OWN SALVATION, NOW THAT QUEEN DAENERYS IS NOT HERE TO FIGHT FOR YOU?

255
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:21,865
It's a problem.

256
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,504
Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill.

257
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:33,448
Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you.

258
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:36,706
We can't fight an enemy we don't know.

259
00:31:37,846 --> 00:31:42,532
The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully,

260
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:44,768
which means they take orders from someone.

261
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,077
- And have you started looking for that someone?
- My little birds have already taken wing.

262
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:54,816
Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks.

263
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:33,101
Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon.

264
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:56,758
Goat?

265
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,648
Ram.

266
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,530
You think our friend got him?

267
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,242
Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn.

268
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:09,258
We're on the right path, then.

269
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,930
Perhaps she's tired of being queen.

270
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:16,729
- I don't think she likes it very much.
- She's too smart to like it.

271
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:21,398
Maybe she's flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us.

272
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:23,936
I've been all over the world.

273
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:28,363
- There's no escaping men like us.
- There's no escaping her, eh?

274
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,491
You keep coming back. Why?

275
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:33,739
You know why.

276
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,053
Isn't it frustrating wanting someone who doesn't want you back?

277
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,865
Of course it is.

278
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,618
You're a romantic. I admire that.

279
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:49,903
Sometimes I look at you and I think, "So that's what I'll be like when I grow old."

280
00:33:50,465 --> 00:33:53,351
- If you grow old.
- If I grow old.

281
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,479
I hope I do.

282
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,825
I want to see what the world looks like when she's done conquering it.

283
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,858
So do I.

284
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,820
Huh, an army?

285
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:24,985
Not an army.

286
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:26,549
A horde.

287
00:34:52,783 --> 00:34:53,834
Dothraki?

288
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:18,653
They have her.

289
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:11,083
MAYBE SHE SAW A GHOST.

290
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,877
MY FRIEND'S MOTHER SAW A GHOST AND HER HAIR TURNED WHITE.

291
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:16,723
PINK PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF THE SUN.

292
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:18,794
IT BURNS THEIR SKIN.

293
00:36:18,794 --> 00:36:22,538
THIS ONE STANDS TOO LONG IN THE SUN AND HER HAID GOES WHITE.

294
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:26,219
YOU THINK SHE'S GOT WHITE PUSSY HAIR TOO?

295
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:28,324
YOU EVER BEEN WITH A GIRL WITH WHITE PUSSY HAIR?

296
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:31,580
ONLY WHEN I WAS FUCKING YOUR GRANDMA.

297
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:36,920
I'LL ASK KHAL MORO FOR A NIGHT WITH YOU.

298
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,163
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

299
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,709
PRETTY EYES, BUT SHE'S AN IDIOT.

300
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:46,818
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SMART TO GET FUCKED IN THE ASS.

301
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:52,215
I LIKE TO TALK WHEN I'M FINISHED. OTHERWISE, WE MIGHT AW WELL BE DOGS.

302
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:25,951
No.

303
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:44,204
FOR YOU, MY KHAL.

304
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:46,872
THE WHITE-HAIRED GIRL WE FOUND IN THE HILLS.

305
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:52,053
LOOK AT THOSE LIPS, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD.

306
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:54,959
BLUE-EYED WOMEN ARE WITCHES.

307
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,568
IT IS KNOWN.

308
00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:01,628
CUT OFF HER HEAD, BEFORE SHE CASTS A SPELL ON YOU.

309
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:04,994
EVEN IF I WAS BLIND,

310
00:38:05,707 --> 00:38:07,527
I'D HEAR MY WIVES SAY,

311
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:10,335
"CUT OFF HER HEAD"

312
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,197
AND I'D KNOW THIS WOMAN IS BEAUTIFUL.

313
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,974
I'M GLAD I'M NOT BLIND.

314
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:19,222
SEEING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NAKED FOR THE FIRST TIME,

315
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:20,945
WHAT IS BETTER THAN THAT?

316
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:22,888
KILLING ANTHER KHAL?

317
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:26,960
YES, KILLING ANOTHER KHAL.

318
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,466
CONQUERING A CITY AND TAKING HER PEOPLE AS SLAVES,

319
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:33,177
AND TAKING HER IDOLS BACK TO BAES DOTHRAK.

320
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,075
BREAKING A WILD HORSE,

321
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:37,381
FORCING IT TO SUBMIT TO YOU WILL.

322
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:43,999
SEEING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NAKED FOR THE FIRST TIME IS AMONG THE FIVE BEST THINGS IN LIFE.

323
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:49,241
DO NOT TOUCH ME.

324
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,483
I AM DAENERYS STORMBORN OF THE HOUSE TARGARYEN,

325
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:04,074
THE FIRST OF HER NAME, THE UNBURNT,

326
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:05,705
QUEEN OF MEEREEN,

327
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:08,469
QUEEN OF THE ANDALS AND THE RHOYNAR AND THE FIRST MEN,

328
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:10,470
KHALEESI OF THE GREAT GRASS SEA,

329
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,457
BREAKER OF CHAINS AND MOTHER OF DRAGONS.

330
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:35,190
YOU ARE NOBODY, THE MILLIONTH OF YOUR NAME,

331
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,900
QUEEN OF NOTHING,

332
00:39:37,512 --> 00:39:39,229
SLAVE OF KHAL MORO.

333
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:41,210
TONIGHT I WILL LIE WITH YOU.

334
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,798
AND IF THE GREAT STALLION IS KIND,

335
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,149
YOU WILL GIVE ME A SON.

336
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:48,011
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

337
00:39:49,574 --> 00:39:51,640
I WILL NOT LIE WITH YOU.

338
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:57,111
AND I WILL BEAR NO CHILDREN, FOR YOU, OR ANYONE ELSE.

339
00:39:57,111 --> 00:40:00,783
NOT UNTIL THE SUN RISES IN THE WEST, AND SETS IN THE EAST.

340
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:03,744
I TOLD YOU SHE WAS A WITCH.

341
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:06,078
CUT OFF HER HEAD.

342
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:10,644
I LIKE HER. SHE HAS SPIRIT.

343
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:15,624
I WAS WIFE TO KHAL DROGO, SON OF KHAL BHARBO.

344
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:22,028
KHAL DROGO IS DEAD.

345
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,376
I KNOW.

346
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:26,428
I BURNT HIS BODY.

347
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,753
FORGIVE ME. I DID NOT KNOW.

348
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:34,737
IT IS FORBIDDEN TO LIE WITH A KHAL'S WIDOW.

349
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:36,228
NO ONE WILL TOUCH YOU.

350
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:41,531
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

351
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:50,344
IF YOU WILL ESCORT ME BACK TO MEEREEN,

352
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:54,667
I WILL SEE THAT YOUR KHALASAR IS GIVEN A THOUSAND HORSES, AS A SIGN OF MY GRATITUDE.

353
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,533
WHEN A KHAL DIES,

354
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,826
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE FOR HIS LHALEESI.

355
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,005
VAES DOTHRAK. THE TEMPLE OF THE DOSH KHALEEN.

356
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:10,835
TO LIVE OUT HER DAYS WITH THE WIDOWS OF DEAD KHALS.

357
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,266
IT IS KNOWN.

358
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:05,078
Thank you.

359
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:23,187
Are you listening, blind girl?

360
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:26,635
Do you hear them talking?

361
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,567
Do any of them talk to you?

362
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,002
No.

363
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:34,782
So sad.

364
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,510
Stand and fight, blind girl.

365
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:49,483
- I can't see.
- That's your problem, not mine.

366
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,232
See you tomorrow.

367
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,822
Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight.

368
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,878
We are both anointed knights.

369
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:21,144
Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear.

370
00:44:21,144 --> 00:44:26,008
I will grant amnesty to all brothers who throw down their arms before nightfall.

371
00:44:26,008 --> 00:44:32,478
And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south a free man with a fresh horse.

372
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:35,487
And some mutton.

373
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:37,825
I'd like some mutton.

374
00:44:38,188 --> 00:44:40,854
- What? - I'm not much of a hunter.

375
00:44:42,081 --> 00:44:45,655
I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it south without starving.

376
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:54,322
We'll give you food. You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like.

377
00:44:55,375 --> 00:44:58,564
Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose.

378
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:03,460
But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood.

379
00:45:04,964 --> 00:45:06,572
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

380
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,473
We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer.

381
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:29,491
Boys, I've been running from men like that all my life.

382
00:45:30,441 --> 00:45:33,751
In my learned opinion, we open that door--

383
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:37,603
- And they'll slaughter us all.
- They want to come in, they're gonna come in.

384
00:45:37,603 --> 00:45:41,305
- Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them. - Edd is our only chance.

385
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,834
It's a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

386
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:51,104
- There's always the Red Woman.
- What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?

387
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:54,644
You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do.
