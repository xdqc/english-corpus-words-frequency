29
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,820
The war is over. Winter has come.

30
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,250
The war is not over.

31
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,760
The true enemy won't wait out the storm.

32
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,410
The King in the North! The King in the North!

33
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,900
Our uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.

34
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,130
He murdered our father,

35
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,100
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

36
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,060
He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.

37
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,260
Build me a thousand ships, and I will give you this world.

38
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,640
There's a storm coming.

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,240
You'll be wanting a roof tonight.

40
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,010
I don't have much,

41
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,600
but I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits.

42
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,220
What did you do?!

43
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,020
They'll both be dead come winter.

44
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,680
Cold winds are rising in the North.

45
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,360
We need good men to help us.

46
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,480
You can still help a lot more than you've harmed, Clegane.

47
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,940
It's not too late for you.

48
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,010
Send me to Oldtown.

49
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,740
I'm to be the new maester.

50
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,280
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

51
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,920
I'll learn about things that all help when...

52
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,140
when they come.

53
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,060
Let go of me!

54
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,150
Are you sure you're ready for this?

55
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,530
I'm the three-eyed raven now. I have to be ready for this.

56
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,440
Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?

57
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,720
Aegon Targaryen.

58
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,190
Aegon used to live here,

59
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,100
and the Targaryens built this castle.

60
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,970
Aye. So they did.

61
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,830
I want us both to go home. But they took it from us.

62
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,580
How do we go home?

63
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,970
You're in the great game now,

64
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,680
and the great game's terrifying. Are you afraid?

65
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,310
My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that.

66
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,440
You're wondering why I brought you all here.

67
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,060
After all, we just had a feast.

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,780
Since when does old Walder

69
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,270
give us two feasts in a single fortnight?

70
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,340
Well, it's no good being Lord of the Riverlands

71
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,710
if you can't celebrate with your family.

72
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,340
That's what I say!

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,020
Yes!

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,720
I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,970
so I can tell you my plans for this great house

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,670
now that winter has come.

77
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,080
But first, a toast!

78
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,510
No more of that Dornish horse piss!

79
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,800
This is the finest Arbor gold!

80
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,170
Proper wine for proper heroes!

81
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,300
Stand together!

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,210
Stand together!

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Not you.

84
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,970
I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.

85
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,350
Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.

86
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,220
I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot.

87
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,230
You're my family, the men who helped me

88
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,440
slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.

89
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,700
Yes, yes.

90
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,240
Cheer.

91
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,170
Brave men, all of you.

92
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,090
Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe.

93
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,400
Cut the throat of a mother of five.

94
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,870
Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home.

95
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,290
But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,540
No, no, that was your mistake.

97
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,850
You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.

98
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,550
Leave one wolf alive

99
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,050
and the sheep are never safe.

100
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,040
When people ask you what happened here...

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,430
tell them the North remembers.

102
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,600
Tell them winter came for House Frey.

104
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,610
You wildlings?

105
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,020
I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed.

106
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,350
This is Brandon Stark,

107
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,420
son of Ned Stark.

108
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,400
How do I know that's true?

109
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,780
You were at the Fist of the First Men.

110
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,590
You were at Hardhome.

111
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,590
You've seen the Army of the Dead.

112
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,670
You've seen the Night King.

113
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,840
He's coming for us.

114
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,800
For all of us.

115
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,810
Okay, come on.

116
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,280
Let's get them inside.

117
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,050
I want every northern maester to scour their records

118
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,490
for any mention of dragonglass.

119
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,240
Dragonglass kills white walkers.

120
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,610
It's more valuable to us now than gold.

121
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,530
We need to find it, we need to mine it,

122
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,440
we need to make weapons from it.

123
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,450
Everyone aged 10 to 60

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,050
will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.

125
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,370
It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.

126
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,490
Not just the boys.

127
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,810
We can't defend the North

128
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,300
if only half the population is fighting.

129
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,210
You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?

130
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,700
I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me.

131
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,670
I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl,

132
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,320
but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.

133
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,680
Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--

134
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,210
And I don't need your permission to defend the North.

135
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,460
We'll begin training every man,

136
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,650
woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

137
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,000
Aye!

138
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,220
While we're preparing for attack,

139
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,910
we need to shore up our defenses.

140
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,820
The only thing standing

141
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,200
between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall,

142
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,430
and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries.

143
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,500
I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

144
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,610
But if we're going to survive this winter together...

145
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,640
You want us to man the castles for you?

146
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,920
Aye.

147
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,910
Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome.

148
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,260
The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

149
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,090
Then that's where I'll go.

150
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,930
Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.

151
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,820
If they breach the Wall,

152
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,510
the first two castles in their path

153
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,880
are Last Hearth and Karhold.

154
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,280
The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North.

155
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,310
Their castles should be torn down

156
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,120
with not a stone left standing.

157
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,640
The castles committed no crimes.

158
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,150
And we need every fortress we have for the war to come.

159
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,380
We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families,

160
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,270
loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.

161
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,060
Aye!

162
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,620
The Umbers and the Karstarks

163
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,990
have fought beside the Starks for centuries.

164
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,550
They've kept faith for generation after generation.

165
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,120
And then they broke faith.

166
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes

167
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,590
because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.

168
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,330
So there's no punishment for treason

169
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,340
and no reward for loyalty?

170
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,220
The punishment for treason is death.

171
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,620
Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle.

172
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,410
Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.

173
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,780
They died fighting for Ramsay.

174
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,380
Give the castles to the families

175
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,980
of the men who died fighting for you.

176
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,930
When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch...

177
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,710
I executed men who betrayed me.

178
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,540
I executed men who refused to follow orders.

179
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,620
My father always said,

180
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,360
"The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"

181
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,090
and I have tried to live by those words.

182
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,020
But I will not punish a son for his father's sins,

183
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,270
and I will not take a family home

184
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,600
away from a family it has belonged to for centuries.

185
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,880
That is my decision,

186
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,780
and my decision is final.

187
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,400
Ned Umber.

188
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,930
Alys Karstark.

189
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,560
For centuries, our families fought

190
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,610
side by side on the battlefield.

191
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,880
I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark,

192
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,510
to serve as our bannermen

193
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,020
and come to our aid whenever called upon.

194
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,470
Stand.

195
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,630
Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore.

196
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,700
The North needs to band together,

197
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,030
all the living north.

198
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,530
Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys,

199
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,380
now and always?

200
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,650
Now and always!

201
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,300
You are my sister, but I am king now.

202
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,850
Will you start wearing a crown?

203
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,200
When you question my decisions

204
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,670
in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.

205
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,540
So I can't question your decisions anymore?

206
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,460
Of course you can, but--

207
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,550
Joffrey never let anyone question his authority.

208
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,200
You think he was a good king?

209
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,180
Do you think I'm Joffrey?

210
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,800
You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.

211
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,030
Thank you.

212
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,880
You're good at this, you know.

213
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,920
- At what? - At ruling.

214
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,300
No.

215
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,230
You are.

216
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,030
You are.

217
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,540
They respect you, they really do,

218
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,710
but you have to

219
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,070
Why are you laughing?

220
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,340
What did father used to say?

221
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,410
Everything before the word "But" is horse shit.

222
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,110
He never said that to me.

223
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,010
No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.

224
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,100
Because he was trying to protect us.

225
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,960
He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is,

226
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,890
but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you.

227
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,360
- Stop trying. - All right, I'll stop trying to protect you

228
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,750
and you stop trying to undermine me.

229
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,610
I'm not trying to undermine you!

230
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,120
You have to be smarter than Father.

231
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,540
You need to be smarter than Robb.

232
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,910
I loved them, I miss them,

233
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,220
but they made stupid mistakes,

234
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,340
and they both lost their heads for it.

235
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,100
And how should I be smarter?

236
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,960
By listening to you?

237
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,580
Would that be so terrible?

238
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,370
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

239
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,390
"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name,

240
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,440
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

241
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,920
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"

242
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,160
What does she want?

243
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,000
Come to King's Landing.

244
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,610
Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.

245
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,420
You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north,

246
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,400
you've forgotten about the one to the south.

247
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him.

248
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,580
And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.

249
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,510
We still have a wall between us and the Night King.

250
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,440
There's nothing between us and Cersei.

251
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,130
There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei.

252
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,030
Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army.

253
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,890
They've never ranged this far north.

254
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,380
You're the military man, but I know her.

255
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,330
If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you.

256
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,660
Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.

257
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,650
You almost sound as if you admire her.

258
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,250
I learned a great deal from her.

259
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,330
What is this?

260
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,440
It's what we've been waiting for our whole lives.

261
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,240
It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.

262
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,290
He knew it.

263
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,740
Made me memorize every damn city, town,

264
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,360
lake, forest, and mountain.

265
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,740
It's ours now. We just have to take it.

266
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,190
You've been quiet since you came home.

267
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,780
Are you angry with me?

268
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,770
No, not angry.

269
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,460
Are you afraid of me?

270
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,550
Should I be?

271
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,670
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand.

272
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,810
Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea,

273
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,470
hoping to take back her father's throne.

274
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,170
Our little brother,

275
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,490
the one you love so much,

276
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,800
the one you set free,

277
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,270
the one who murdered our father and our first-born son,

278
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,930
now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel.

279
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,290
He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada.

280
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,280
Where will they land?

281
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,510
Dragonstone.

282
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,310
They have deep-water ports for the ships.

283
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,260
Stannis left the castle unoccupied,

284
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,830
and that's where she was born.

285
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,020
Enemies to the east.

286
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,770
Enemies to the south--

287
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,580
Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

288
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,110
Enemies to the west--

289
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,470
Olenna, the old cunt.

290
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,650
Another traitor.

291
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,580
Enemies to the north.

292
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,490
Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North

293
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,890
and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him.

294
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,720
Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors.

295
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,220
You're in command of the Lannister army now.

296
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,640
- How do we proceed? - Winter is here.

297
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,330
We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses.

298
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,800
The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.

299
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,020
Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside

300
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,290
a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?

301
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,600
If they think Daenerys will win.

302
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,110
No one wants to fight on the losing side.

303
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,460
Right now, we look like the losing side.

304
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,870
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

305
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,200
Three kingdoms, at best.

306
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,410
I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.

307
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,100
I understand we're in a war for survival.

308
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,240
I understand whoever loses dies.

309
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,050
I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty

310
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,770
that lasts a thousand years.

311
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,500
A dynasty for whom?

312
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,920
Our children are dead.

313
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,530
We're the last of us.

314
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,370
A dynasty for us, then.

315
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,240
We never talked about Tommen.

316
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,590
There's nothing to say.

317
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,920
Our baby boy killed himself.

318
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,100
He betrayed me.

319
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,960
He betrayed us both.

320
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,700
Should we spend our days mourning the dead--

321
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,430
mother, father, and all our children?

322
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,550
- Cersei-- - I loved them. I did.

323
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,700
But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood.

324
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,930
We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.

325
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,390
Even Lannisters can't survive without allies.

326
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,470
Where are our allies now?

327
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,030
You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.

328
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,140
I heard.

329
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:19,050
- How could we ever trust a man like that? - We couldn't.

330
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,860
He was a useless, old coward,

331
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,070
but the Freys supported us.

332
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,150
Now they're all dead.

333
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,790
Whoever killed them is no friend of ours.

334
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,490
We need allies.

335
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,210
Stronger, better allies.

336
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,990
We can't win this war alone.

337
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,920
You think I listened to Father for 40 years

338
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,900
and learned nothing?

339
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,600
The Greyjoys?

340
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,170
You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?

341
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,550
- Not all of them. - Well, it looks like all of them.

342
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,210
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

343
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,470
the new King of the Iron Islands.

344
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,040
You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies.

345
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,780
- There you are. - How are they better allies?

346
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,100
How are they different from the Freys?

347
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,410
They both broke their promises

348
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,270
and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.

349
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,990
So does everyone when it suits them.

350
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,730
Unlike the Freys, they have ships.

351
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,610
- And they're good at killing. - They're not good at anything.

352
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,980
I know the ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people.

353
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,750
All they know how to do is

354
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,340
steal things they can't build or grow themselves.

355
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,140
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

356
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,090
Oh, what did he come here for, then?

357
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,870
A queen.

358
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,540
The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands,

359
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,180
they turned on me.

360
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,340
Their own uncle.

361
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,510
They stole my best ships and ran.

362
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,200
Sailed them right across the world

363
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
and gave them to the Dragon Queen

364
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,530
so she could bring her armies here to attack you.

365
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,480
It's nothing compared to the treason you suffered

366
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,080
at the hands of a family member, from what I hear.

367
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,700
But still, it bothers me.

368
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,130
Murdering them would make me feel a lot better.

369
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,490
And since it appears that all our treasonous family members

370
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,600
are fighting for the same side,

371
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,970
I thought we rightful monarchs

372
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,280
could murder them together.

373
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,850
You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?

374
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,050
The Greyjoys rebelled against

375
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,590
the throne for the right to be monarchs,

376
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,240
but as I recall, you were soundly defeated.

377
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,890
Come to mention it,

378
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,990
weren't you the one who started that rebellion

379
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,630
by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet?

380
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,050
You certainly caught us there.

381
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,600
Very smart move on your part.

382
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,050
Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway.

383
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,040
I was there.

384
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,610
I remember very well.

385
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,960
I saw you.

386
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,150
I heard so much talk.

387
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,460
The best in the world. No one can stop him.

388
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,060
I didn't believe it, to be honest.

389
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,230
But I must say when you rushed through the breach

390
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,370
and started cutting people down...

391
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,900
it was glorious.

392
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
Like a dance.

393
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,430
The people I was cutting down were your own kin.

394
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,970
The place was getting crowded.

395
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,210
I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

396
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,460
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

397
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,860
A good thing for me.

398
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,450
If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile.

399
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,880
If I hadn't done that,

400
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,840
I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.

401
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,580
If not the most humble.

402
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,430
You're not humble.

403
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,690
You're the queen of a great nation.

404
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,510
You don't care about the Iron Islands.

405
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:33,720
They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--

406
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,440
and a lot of very unattractive people.

407
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,520
The Iron Fleet, on the other hand,

408
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,700
that's something else entirely.

409
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,680
It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen.

410
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,290
With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.

411
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,920
You can defeat the invaders of the east

412
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,540
and the pretenders of the north and south.

413
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,910
What do you want in return?

414
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,710
Ever since I was a little boy,

415
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,590
I wanted to grow up and marry

416
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,990
the most beautiful woman in the world.

417
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,150
So here I am,

418
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,260
with a thousand ships

419
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,660
and two good hands.

420
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,830
I decline your proposal.

421
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,730
Why?

422
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,420
You're not trustworthy.

423
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,170
You've broken promises to allies before

424
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,670
and murdered them at the nearest opportunity.

425
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,350
You murdered your own brother.

426
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,030
You should try it. Feels wonderful.

427
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,640
I don't expect you to trust me outright.

428
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,200
You need proof of my honest intentions.

429
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,560
In my experience,

430
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,420
the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift.

431
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,000
A priceless gift.

432
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,670
I won't return to King's Landing

433
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,440
until I have that for you.

434
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,590
Ah, Maester Weyland.

435
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,160
A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.

436
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,390
Weigh that.

437
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,040
The triumph of transitory pleasures.

438
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,620
Mankind's curse.

439
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,650
Archmaester, I was wondering...

440
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,060
What's the weight?

441
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:23,520
Um, 147.

442
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,810
I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.

443
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,950
I don't remember your proposition.

444
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,880
I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North,

445
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,160
if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.

446
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,650
That area is reserved for maesters.

447
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
- Are you a maester? - No.

448
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
Not a very strong proposition, is it?

449
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:56,360
Archmaester, with respect,

450
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,110
I've seen them...

451
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,740
the Army of the Dead.

452
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,920
The white walkers.

453
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,010
I was sent here to learn how to defeat them,

454
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,780
but everyone in the Citadel,

455
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,770
those who will even talk to me,

456
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,270
they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.

457
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,560
Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything.

458
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,620
It's their job.

459
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,520
But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication.

460
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,080
Too many similarities from unconnected sources.

461
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,720
Sources in the restricted area?

462
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,930
The very same.

463
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,190
And the simplest explanation

464
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,970
for your grating obsession with the white walkers

465
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,730
is that you're telling the truth

466
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,470
and that you saw what you say you saw.

467
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,710
So, you believe me.

468
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,660
I do.

469
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,230
You'll finish weighing that heart?

470
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,140
That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.

471
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,550
We're not like the people south of the Twins.

472
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,660
And we're not like the people north of the Twins.

473
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,680
In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons.

474
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,240
We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly.

475
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,940
Without us, men would be little better than dogs.

476
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,400
Don't remember any meal but the last,

477
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,710
can't see forward to any but the next.

478
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,120
And every time you leave the house and shut the door,

479
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,040
they howl like you're gone forever.

480
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,560
When Robert's Rebellion was raging,

481
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,030
people thought the end was near.

482
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,150
The end of the Targaryen dynasty. "How will we survive?"

483
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,080
When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward

484
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,400
and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush,

485
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,660
"The end is near! How will we survive?"

486
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,350
And thousands of years before that, during the Long Night,

487
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,390
we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end.

488
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:52,320
But it wasn't. None of it was.

489
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,360
The Wall has stood through it all.

490
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,630
And every winter that ever came has ended.

491
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,980
Be a good lad. Clean this up.

492
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,400
Nope.

493
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,780
Nope.

494
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,350
You're a lucky man.

495
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,660
I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat.

496
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,190
She's a very impressive woman.

497
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,380
What do you want, Lord Baelish?

498
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,320
I want you to be happy.

499
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,120
I want you to be safe.

500
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,560
I am safe.

501
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,930
I'm at home, surrounded by friends.

502
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,760
I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.

503
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,200
What about happy?

504
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,840
Why aren't you happy?

505
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,470
What do you want that you do not have?

506
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,000
At the moment, peace and quiet.

507
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,170
No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish.

508
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,450
I'll assume it was something clever.

509
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,460
My lady.

510
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,050
My lady.

511
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,230
Why is he still here?

512
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,660
We need his men.

513
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,440
Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle.

514
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,620
Littlefinger saved us.

515
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,100
He wants something.

516
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,460
I know exactly what he wants.

517
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,800
*He rode through the streets of the city*

518
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,210
*Down from his hill on high*

519
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,500
*O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles*

520
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,760
*He rode to a woman's sigh*

521
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,450
*For she was his secret treasure*

522
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,530
*She was his shame and his bliss*

523
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,880
*And a chain and a keep are nothing*

524
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,550
*Compared to a woman's kiss*

525
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,910
*For hands of gold are always cold*

526
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,980
*But a woman's hands are warm*

527
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,520
*For hands of gold are always cold*

528
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,520
*But a woman's hands are¡­*

529
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,070
That's a pretty song.

530
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,600
I've never heard it before.

531
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,630
It's a new one.

532
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,230
Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.

533
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,320
I don't want to steal your food.

534
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,160
You're not stealing, we're offering.

535
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,820
Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

536
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,730
You heading south?

537
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,050
King's Landing.

538
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,190
Poor girl.

539
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,700
Not so bad, is it?

540
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,940
Depends on your taste, I guess.

541
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,020
If you like your streets covered

542
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,600
in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

543
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,340
All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep,

544
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,630
the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit.

545
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,310
Then when I finally make it,

546
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,290
they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep,

547
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,450
the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell,

548
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,920
and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.

549
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,270
The people who live there,

550
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,150
they'd skin you alive if

551
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,040
they could make two coppers off your hide.

552
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,910
Worst place in the world.

553
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,280
What are you doing in the Riverlands?

554
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,310
There's been some trouble with the Freys up at the Twins,

555
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,910
so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace.

556
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,870
Here you go. Guests first.

557
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,570
Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.

558
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,100
My mother always told me to be kind to strangers.

559
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,950
Strangers will be kind to you.

560
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,320
You're a long way from home.

561
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,570
I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.

562
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,520
Yeah, endless adventures.

563
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,270
They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.

564
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,890
The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away.

565
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,210
But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home.

566
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:57,240
I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone.

567
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,140
I ought to be out there with him.

568
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,450
My wife just had our first baby.

569
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,700
- Boy or girl? - Oh, who knows?

570
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,380
You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?

571
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,460
- I hope it's a girl. - Why?

572
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,450
Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old.

573
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,090
Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.

574
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,000
Are you old enough to drink?

575
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,150
It's blackberry wine.

576
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,960
I made it myself.

577
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,380
It's really good.

578
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,290
So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?

579
00:41:58,290 --> 00:41:59,890
I'm going to kill the queen.

580
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,670
Bad night to be outdoors.

581
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,230
You've got real powerful magic to figure that out.

582
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,470
Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear?

583
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,730
"It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy.

584
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,030
It's gonna be a cold night."

585
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,820
You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane?

586
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,880
You want some rum?

587
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,520
Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

588
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,120
Why are you always in such a foul mood?

589
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,500
Experience.

590
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,560
This seems like a good place to spend the night.

591
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,130
These people don't want us here.

592
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,120
Seems deserted to me. No livestock.

593
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,200
No smoke coming from the chimney.

594
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,380
I don't like the look of it.

595
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,170
For a big, hard man, you scare easy.

596
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,600
I'll tell you what doesn't scare me--

597
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,820
bald cocksuckers like you.

598
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,840
You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot?

599
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,740
Bald cunt.

600
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,500
Come on.

601
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,350
Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.

602
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,850
They don't.

603
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,300
See if there's a larder.

604
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
They always leave something behind.

605
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,050
How do you think it ended for them?

606
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,270
With death.

607
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,620
Girl died in her father's arms.

608
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,030
Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet.

609
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,860
I'd say they were starving.

610
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,010
And rather than let his little girl suffer,

611
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:55,930
he ended it for both of them.

612
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,020
Doesn't matter now.

613
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,320
No, doesn't matter now.

614
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,310
I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.

615
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,560
Aye.

616
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,450
I think the first time we met was at that tournament--

617
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,470
And I always thought you were dull as dirt.

618
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,360
You're not bad.

619
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,340
I don't hate you.

620
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,520
Don't like you, but you're not bad.

621
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,100
Thank you, Clegane.

622
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:35,890
That warms the heart.

623
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,810
But there's nothing special about you.

624
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,970
You're right about that.

625
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,480
So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back?

626
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,160
I've met better men than you,

627
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,860
and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded,

628
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,110
or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere.

629
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,000
None of them came back.

630
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,790
So, why you?

631
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:04,200
You think I don't ask myself that?

632
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,650
Every hour of every day?

633
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,260
Why am I here?

634
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,430
What am I supposed to do?

635
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,390
What does the Lord see in me?

636
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,610
And?

637
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,800
I don't know.

638
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,970
I don't understand our Lord.

639
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,800
Your Lord.

640
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,820
I don't know what He wants from me.

641
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,300
I only know that He wants me alive.

642
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,830
If he's so all-powerful,

643
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,940
why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?

644
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,780
Clegane.

645
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,040
Come over here.

646
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,620
Don't worry. The fire won't bite.

647
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,590
I want to show you something.

648
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,250
It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.

649
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,890
Aye.

650
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,730
Almost seems like divine justice.

651
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,830
There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt.

652
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,860
If there was, you'd be dead...

653
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,390
and that girl would be alive.

654
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,400
- What do you want? - Look into the flames.

655
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,200
I don't want to look in the damn flames.

656
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,360
You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down.

657
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,120
Don't you want to know what gave me the power?

658
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,410
I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.

659
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,150
We can't tell you.

660
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,310
Only the fire can tell you.

661
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,270
What do you see?

662
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,570
Logs burning.

663
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,670
Keep looking.

664
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,580
What do you see?

665
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,240
Ice.

666
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,550
A wall of ice.

667
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,480
The Wall.

668
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,100
What else?

669
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,440
It's where the Wall meets the sea.

670
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,400
There's a castle there.

671
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,990
There's a mountain.

672
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,300
Looks like an arrowhead.

673
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,020
The dead are marching past.

674
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,160
Thousands of them.

675
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,460
Do you believe me now, Clegane?

676
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,750
Do you believe we're here for a reason?

677
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,490
What the hell are you doing, Clegane?

678
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,790
Burying the dead.

679
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,760
You knew these people.

680
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,870
Not really.

681
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,410
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy.

682
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,960
We ask the Mother to...

683
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,360
Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.

684
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,090
I'm sorry you're dead.

685
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,350
You deserved better.

686
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,060
Both of you.

687
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:55,580
Mom.

688
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,830
You should really sleep, Sam.

689
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,330
The dead don't.

690
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,850
"Legends of the Long Night."

691
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,710
The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons

692
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:20,680
without even knowing what the First Men used it for.

693
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:38,950
What is it?

694
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,430
It's a map of Dragonstone.

695
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,700
The Targaryens built their first stronghold there

696
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,590
when they invaded Westeros.

697
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,870
That's dragonglass?

698
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,520
A mountain of it.

699
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,850
Beneath the ground.

700
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,070
Stannis told me, but I didn't think...

701
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,010
This is important. Jon needs to know.

702
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:54,490
Has she come yet?

703
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,060
Who?

704
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,270
The Dragon Queen.

705
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:00,790
Daenerys Stormborn.

706
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,030
Haven't heard anything.

707
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,180
Shall we begin?

708
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,950
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

710
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,420
The Mad King's daughter will destroy the realm.

711
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,740
We have an army of fleets and three dragons.

712
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:18,040
We should hit King's Landing now.
