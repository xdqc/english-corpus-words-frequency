37
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,780
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor.

38
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,420
The girl is innocent.

39
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,180
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.

40
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,200
You must write to Lady Catelyn.

41
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,880
If you would help your father,

42
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,460
urge your brother to keep the king's peace.

43
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,900
Tell him to come to King's Landing,

44
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,860
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

45
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,650
You're sure this is the only copy in Winterfell?

46
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,800
Daenerys is not her father.

47
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,590
And she never will be. With the right counsel.

48
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,790
I am her hand, not her head.

49
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,730
I can't make her decisions for her.

50
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,410
You need to find a way to make her listen.

51
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,570
It's called Longclaw. It was my father's sword.

52
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,580
It was meant for my son, Jorah.

53
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,310
He brought dishonor to our house,

54
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,380
but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.

55
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,300
Clegane, look into the flames. What do you see?

56
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,450
There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead.

57
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,120
The dead are marching past. Thousands of 'em.

58
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,790
Cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story.

59
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,010
What if we prove her wrong,

60
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,090
bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth?

61
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,590
We're all on the same side.

62
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,740
We're all breathin'.

63
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,680
You alright?

64
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,530
Haven't been North before?

65
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,870
Never seen snow before.

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,070
Beautiful, eh? I can breathe again.

67
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,700
Down south the air smells like pig shit.

68
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,070
- You've never been down south. - I've been to Winterfell.

69
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,350
That's the North.

70
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,400
How do you live up here?

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,590
How d'you keep your balls from freezing off?

72
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,870
You've got to keep moving, that's the secret.

73
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,590
Walking's good, fighting's better,

74
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,060
fucking's best.

75
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,090
There's not a living woman within 100 miles from here.

76
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,100
We've got to make do with what we've got.

77
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,170
This one is maybe not so smart.

78
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,770
- Davos says he's a strong fighter. - Good.

79
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,400
That's more important than being smart.

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,610
Smart people don't come here looking for the dead.

81
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,270
So, you've met this Dragon queen, huh?

82
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,890
And?

83
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,370
She will only fight beside us if I bend the knee.

84
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,480
You spent too much time with the Free Folk.

85
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,370
Now you don't like kneeling.

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,910
Mance Rayder was a great man. Proud man.

87
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,380
The King Beyond the Wall and never bent the knee.

88
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,330
How many of us people died for his pride?

89
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,580
You still mad at us, boy?

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,900
- You sold me to a witch. - A priestess.

91
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,190
I'll admit it, it is a subtle distinction.

92
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,820
We're fighting a great war.

93
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,660
- Wars cost money. - I wanted to be one of you.

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,960
I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off.

95
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,460
Like a slave.

96
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,610
You know what she did to me?

97
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,900
She struck me down on the bed, she stripped me naked...

98
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
Sounds alright so far...

99
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,950
And put leeches on me!

100
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,640
- Was she naked too? - She needed your blood.

101
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,640
- Yes, thank you, I know that. - Could've been worse.

102
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,060
She wanted to kill me.

103
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,890
And would have killed me if it weren't for...

104
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,180
But they didn't, did they?

105
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,510
So what you winging about?

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,730
I'm not winging.

107
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,980
Your lips are moving

108
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,750
and you complain about something. That's winging.

109
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,590
This one has been killed six times

110
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,570
and you don't hear him bitching about it.

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,380
Good lad.

112
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,910
The first time I went north of the Wall, was with your father.

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,150
He was a good man.

114
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,450
He deserved a better son.

115
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,550
Were you with him at the end?

116
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,090
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

117
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,490
But we avenged him.

118
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,610
I want you to know that, every mutineer found justice.

119
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,890
Can't think of a worse way for him to go.

120
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,020
The Night's Watch was his life.

121
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,580
He would have died to protect every one of those men.

122
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,070
And they butchered him.

123
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,990
I hate that he died that way.

124
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,940
And my father was the most honorable man I have ever met.

125
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,440
He was good, all the way through.

126
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,550
And he died on the executioner's block.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,460
Your father wanted to execute me, you know.

128
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,190
I heard.

129
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,520
It was in the right, of course.

130
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,930
Didn't make me hate him any less.

131
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,330
I'm glad he didn't catch you.

132
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,270
Me too.

133
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,980
Your father gave me this sword.

134
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,360
Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf.

135
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,670
But it's still Longclaw.

136
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,230
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.

137
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,420
But you are back.

138
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,590
And it's been in your family for centuries.

139
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,400
It's not right for me to have it.

140
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,210
He gave it to you.

141
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,040
I'm not his son.

142
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,040
I brought shame onto my house.

143
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,700
I broke my father's heart.

144
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,550
I forfeited the right to claim his sword.

145
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,850
It's yours.

146
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,160
May it serve you well.

147
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,030
And your children after you.

148
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,900
Father used to watch us from up here.

149
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,330
He wouldn't say much.

150
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,560
You probably don't remember,

151
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,490
you were inside knitting all the time.

152
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,190
I remember.

153
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,600
One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick,

154
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,550
I came out here after

155
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,180
and Bran had left his bow behind,

156
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,230
just lying on the ground.

157
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,290
Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.

158
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,910
There was one arrow in the target

159
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,960
and with no one around, just like now.

160
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,220
No one to stop me.

161
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,960
So I started shooting.

162
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,730
And every shot I had to go up there and get my one arrow

163
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,580
and walk back and shoot it again.

164
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,710
I wasn't very good.

165
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,990
Finally, I've hit the bull's eye.

166
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,350
Could've been the 20th shot. Or the 50th. I don't remember.

167
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,120
But I hit the bull's eye.

168
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,200
And I heard this.

169
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,380
I looked up.

170
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,070
And he was standing right here, smiling down on me.

171
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,520
I knew what I was doing was against the rules

172
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,080
but he was smiling, so I knew it wasn't wrong.

173
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,520
The rules were wrong.

174
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,200
I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.

175
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,750
Now he's dead.

176
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,310
Killed by the Lannisters.

177
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,210
With your help.

178
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,180
What?

179
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,780
That's your pretty handwriting.

180
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,340
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

181
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,980
cause I couldn't write as well as you.

182
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,940
Robb,

183
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,050
I write to you today with heavy heart.

184
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,830
Our good King Robert is dead.

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,070
Killed from wounds he took in a bull...

186
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,010
You don't have to read it.

187
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,290
- I remember. - Father has been charged with treason.

188
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,190
He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey

189
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,970
and tried to steal his throne.

190
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,850
The Lannisters are treating me well

191
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,880
and providing me with every comfort.

192
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,080
I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey

193
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,330
and prevent any strife

194
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,990
between the great houses of Lannister and Stark

195
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,160
Your faithful sister, Sansa.

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,460
- They forced me to do it. - Did they?

197
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,410
With a knife at your throat?

198
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,290
Did they put you in a rack and

199
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,080
stretched you till your bones started to crack?

200
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,480
You should have known what it was like. I was a child.

201
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,580
So was I.

202
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,160
I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.

203
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,750
They told me it was the only way to save father.

204
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,510
And you were stupid enough to believe them.

205
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,650
I remember you, standing on that platform

206
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,150
with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father to the block.

207
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,890
I remember the pretty dress you were wearing,

208
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,110
the fancy way you did your hair.

209
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,920
- You were there. - I was there.

210
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,950
Standing in the crown near Baelor's statue.

211
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,480
And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue?

212
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,180
Did you fight with the Lannisters and save father?

213
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,780
- I wanted to. - But you didn't.

214
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,480
- Just like me. - I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb.

215
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,280
I didn't betray my entire family for my beloved Joffrey.

216
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,830
You should be on your knees thanking me.

217
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,020
We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.

218
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,410
You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back,

219
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,750
he lost the Battle of the Bastards.

220
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,370
The Knights of the Vale have won the battle

221
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,410
and they rode north for me.

222
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,850
While you were where? Travelling the world?

223
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,770
- I was training. - Training?

224
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,910
Well, while you were training,

225
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,630
I suffered things you can never imagine.

226
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,860
Oh, I didn't know that and I can imagine quite a lot.

227
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,290
You never would have survived what I survived.

228
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,980
I guess we'll never know.

229
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,450
What are you going to do with that letter?

230
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,900
I don't know yet.

231
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,530
Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?

232
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,940
You're scared, aren't you?

233
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,680
What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes.

234
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,530
- No one's gonna hang you. - Arya!

235
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,570
You're scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry.

236
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,240
Not, that's not Jon.

237
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,090
He'll understand, you were just a scared little girl.

238
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,460
All alone with the wicked Lannisters.

239
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,590
Do you know how happy Cersei

240
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,690
would be right now if she saw us fighting?

241
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,790
This is exactly what she wants, what she always wanted.

242
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,410
- to tear us apart. - You are scared the Northern lords will read it.

243
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,300
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

244
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,440
if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.

245
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,370
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

246
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,920
She's younger than you were when you wrote this.

247
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,390
Are you going to say "But I was just a child"?

248
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,820
You're angry.

249
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,900
Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.

250
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,780
Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.

251
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,860
I'll go with anger.

252
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
You're the one they call the dog.

253
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,320
Fuck off.

254
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,750
They told me you were mean.

255
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,260
Were your born mean or you just hate wildlings?

256
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,760
I could not give two shits about wildlings.

257
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,330
Gingers I hate.

258
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,080
Gingers are beautiful.

259
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,920
Kissed by fire.

260
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,680
Just like you.

261
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,910
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

262
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,490
Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?

263
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,820
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

264
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,650
Ever since, you've been mean.

265
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,280
Well, you fuck off.

266
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,150
I don't think you're truly mean.

267
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,770
You have sad eyes.

268
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,160
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

269
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,080
- Dick? - Cock.

270
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,340
Ah, dick.

271
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,930
I like it.

272
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,650
Bet you do.

273
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,460
Nop, it's pussy for me.

274
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,310
I have a beauty waiting for me back in Winterfell.

275
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,240
If I ever get back there.

276
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,880
Yellow hair,

277
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,230
blue eyes.

278
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,510
Tallest woman you've ever seen.

279
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,330
Almost as tall as you.

280
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,530
Brienne of Tarth?

281
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,990
- You know her? - Yours is Brienne of fucking Tarth?

282
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,220
Well, not with her yet.

283
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,190
But I see the way she looks at me.

284
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,690
How does she look at you?

285
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,190
Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?

286
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,070
You do know her.

287
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,080
We've met.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,360
I want to make babies with her.

289
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,510
Think of them.

290
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,600
Great big monsters.

291
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,120
They conquer the world.

292
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,030
How did a mad fucker like you live this long?

293
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm good at killing people.

294
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,640
- You don't look much like him. - Who's that?

295
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,060
Your father.

296
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,330
I suppose you favor your mother.

297
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,920
You knew him?

298
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,840
Of course I did.

299
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,640
When he was Hand.

300
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,090
He sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

301
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,040
Your wildlings then told me the Red Woman brought you back.

302
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,950
Thoros has brought me back

303
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,970
six times.

304
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,830
We both serve the same lord.

305
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,010
I serve the North.

306
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,440
The North did not raise you from the dead.

307
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,480
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

308
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,850
I don't know anything about him.

309
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,350
I don't know what he wants from me.

310
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,740
He wants you alive.

311
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,820
- Why? - I don't know.

312
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,890
That's what anyone can tell me. I don't know.

313
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,390
So what's the point of serving a god,

314
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,270
none of us knows what he wants?

315
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,950
I think about that all the time.

316
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,220
I don't think it's our purpose to understand.

317
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,040
Except one thing.

318
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,740
We're soldiers.

319
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,360
We have to know what we're fighting for.

320
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,990
I'm not fighting so some man or

321
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,070
woman I barely know can sit in a throne made of swords.

322
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,730
So what are you fighting for?

323
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,530
Life.

324
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,920
Death is the enemy.

325
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,680
The first enemy.

326
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,170
And the last.

327
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,640
But we all die.

328
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,140
The enemy always wins.

329
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,260
But we still need to fight him.

330
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,020
That's all I know.

331
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,430
You and I won't find much joy while we're here.

332
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,160
But we can keep up the life.

333
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,420
We can defend those who can't defend themselves.

334
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,510
I am the shield that guards the realm of men.

335
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,240
Maybe we don't need to understand anymore than that.

336
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,730
Maybe that's enough.

337
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,390
Aye.

338
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,680
Maybe that's enough.

339
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,500
That's what I saw in the fire.

340
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,610
A mountain like an arrow head.

341
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,780
Are you sure?

342
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,500
We're getting close.

343
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,510
Do you know what I like about you?

344
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,290
- I honestly don't. - You're not a hero.

345
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,790
Oh.

346
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,320
I've been heroic on occasion.

347
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,140
I once charged through the Mud Gate of King's Landing.

348
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,980
I don't want you to be a hero.

349
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,780
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

350
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,260
Drogo, Jorah, Daario, even this...

351
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,880
Jon Snow.

352
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,230
They all try to outdo each other.

353
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
Who can do the stupidest bravest thing...

354
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,420
It's interesting, these heroes you name...

355
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,960
Drogo, Jorah,

356
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,670
Daarios, even this...

357
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,580
Jon Snow...

358
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,700
They all fell in love with you.

359
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,270
Jon Snow is not in love with me.

360
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,580
Oh, my mistake.

361
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,550
I suppose he stares at you longingly

362
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,370
because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.

363
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,320
He's too little for me.

364
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,260
I didn't mean...

365
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,560
As heroes go he is quite little.

366
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,540
I know you're brave.

367
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,140
I wouldn't have chosen a coward as my Hand.

368
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,650
So...

369
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,740
if all goes well, I'll finally get to meet your sister.

370
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,310
From everything you've told me about her

371
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,880
she's rather murder me than speak.

372
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,400
First she'd torture you

373
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,650
in some horrible way, then she'd murder you.

374
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,840
Nobody trusts my sister less than I do, believe me.

375
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,150
But if we go to the capital,

376
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,880
we'll go with two armies,

377
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,240
we'll go with three dragons,

378
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,550
and anyone touches you,

379
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,860
King's Landing burns down to the foundation stone.

380
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,060
And right now she's thinking of how to set a trap.

381
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,090
Of course she is.

382
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,730
And she's wondering what trap you're laying for her.

383
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,630
Are we?

384
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,500
Laying any traps?

385
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,640
If we want to create a new and better world,

386
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,980
I'm not sure deceit and mass murder are the best ways to start.

387
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,490
Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?

388
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,510
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

389
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,120
if you're going to win the throne.

390
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,330
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

391
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,670
But fear is all Cersei has.

392
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,270
It's all my father had... And Joffrey.

393
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,610
It makes their power brittle.

394
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,510
Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.

395
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,960
Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.

396
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,870
He did.

397
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,000
But you once spoke to me about breaking the wheel.

398
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,760
Aegon built the wheel.

399
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,000
If that's the kind of queen you want to be,

400
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,850
how are you different from

401
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,750
all the other tyrants that came before you?

402
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,890
So we walk into the lion's den?

403
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,950
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip on the Lannister forces.

404
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,290
Forgive me, but I don't care about any Lannister promises.

405
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,420
Except yours.

406
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,320
And I promised him

407
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,510
I'd keep you from doing anything impulsive.

408
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,660
Impulsive?

409
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,500
This will be a difficult negotiation.

410
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,250
We're sitting down with people who want to see us both headless.

411
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,130
My sister is likely to say something provocative.

412
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:03,930
And?

413
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,650
And you've been known to lose your temper from time to time.

414
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,960
- As all our great leaders do... - When have I lost my temper?

415
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,880
Burning the Tarlys for instance.

416
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,710
That was not impulsive.

417
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,940
That was necessary.

418
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,090
- Perhaps. - Perhaps.

419
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
Perhaps the father needed to die and not the son.

420
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,380
Perhaps they both needed time to

421
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,430
contemplate the mistakes in the solitude of a cold cell.

422
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,330
We had no time to discuss the possibility

423
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,370
before you ended their possibilities.

424
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,550
One can be forgiven for thinking

425
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,470
you're taking your family's side in this debate.

426
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,500
I am taking their side.

427
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,590
You need to take your enemy's side.

428
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,470
You need to see things the way they do.

429
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,550
And you need to see things the way they do

430
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,440
if you're gonna anticipate their actions,

431
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,930
respond effectively and beat them.

432
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,930
Which I want you to do very much.

433
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,510
Because I believe in you

434
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,470
and the world you want to build.

435
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,240
But the world you want to build

436
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,980
doesn't get build all at once. Probably not in a single lifetime.

437
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,480
How do we ensure your vision endures?

438
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,140
After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?

439
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,850
You want to know who sits on the Iron Throne after I'm dead, is that it?

440
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,240
You say you can't have children.

441
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,440
But there are other ways of choosing a successor.

442
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,790
The Night's Watch has one method.

443
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,120
The Ironborn folk,

444
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,340
among their many flaws have another...

445
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,860
We will discuss the succession after I wear the crown.

446
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,700
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

447
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,890
fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush,

448
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,140
and I saw hundred of arrows miss.

449
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,520
But any one of them could have found your heart and end...

450
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,960
You've been thinking about my death quite a bit, haven't you?

451
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,540
Is this one of the items you've discussed

452
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,890
with your brother in King's Landing?

453
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,190
I'm trying to serve you by planning on the long term.

454
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,130
Perhaps if you'd planned for the short term,

455
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,180
we wouldn't have lost Dorne and Highgarden.

456
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,390
We will discuss the succession

457
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,570
after I wear the crown.

458
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,050
Look.

459
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,280
A bear.

460
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,070
Big fucker.

461
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,850
The bears have blue eyes.

462
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,230
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

463
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,120
Flask.

464
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,430
Go on.

465
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,480
You all right?

466
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,390
I just got bit by a dead bear.

467
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,340
Aye.

468
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,920
You did.

469
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,700
Funny old life.

470
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,780
Alright then.

471
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,840
We're off.

472
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,780
- Where did she get it? - I don't know.

473
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,510
She seems very resourceful.

474
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,670
You're worried.

475
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,440
We're asking 20,000 men to fight with us

476
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,080
in the worst winter any of them have ever seen.

477
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,250
The weather will be the least of their problem.

478
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,340
Many of them will be happy to find a good reason to go home.

479
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,500
You question their loyalty?

480
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,490
Their loyalty is to Jon.

481
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,290
Jon is not here. I haven't heard from him in weeks.

482
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,060
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

483
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,360
The King chose you to rule in his absence.

484
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,310
And rule you have.

485
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,980
Wisely.

486
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,530
Ably.

487
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,070
They say that, they respect you.

488
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,250
Some may even prefer you.

489
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,530
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

490
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,220
when it was time to retake Winterfell

491
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,390
and then they named him their king

492
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,360
and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again.

493
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,860
How far would you trust men like that?

494
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,020
They're all bloody wind vanes.

495
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,390
If they found out I wrote that letter...

496
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,040
a woman who's already

497
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,050
married not one but two enemies of her House...

498
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,210
By the time Jon comes back, he'll have no army left.

499
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,480
Arya is not like them.

500
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,660
She's your sister.

501
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,550
You may have disagreements,

502
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,390
but she would never betray her family.

503
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,710
She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.

504
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,590
Is that what she thinks?

505
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,250
I don't know what she thinks.

506
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,140
I don't know her anymore.

507
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,490
Perhaps Lady Brienne can help.

508
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,230
She's sworn to protect both of Catelyn Stark girls.

509
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Is she not?

510
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,490
She is.

511
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,120
And if one of you were planning to harm the other in any way,

512
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,420
wouldn't she be honor bound to intercede?

513
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,430
She would.

514
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,950
Something I've always wanted to know.

515
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,270
Alright.

516
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,040
How drunk were you when you charged through the breach on Pyke?

517
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,350
For being honest, I don't remember charging through the breach.

518
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,830
Some of the lads told me about it the next morning.

519
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,090
Some damn good scrap.

520
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,280
Alright.

521
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,630
It was a proper scrap.

522
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,670
The Ironborn thought you were some kind of god

523
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,850
when you were waving that flaming sword.

524
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,780
I thought you were the bravest man I ever saw.

525
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,360
Just the drunkest.

526
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,740
Where's the rest of them?

527
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,970
If we wait long enough we will find out.

528
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,830
Go back to Eastwatch.

529
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,150
Get a raven to Daenerys, tell her what's happened.

530
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,040
- I'm not leaving you. - You're the fastest.

531
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,160
Go! Now!

532
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,040
You're faster without the hammer. Give it!

533
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,370
Give it!

534
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,670
- Run! - Run!

535
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,200
Come on!

536
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,280
Stop!

537
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,310
Go!

538
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,310
What happened?

539
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,650
Where are the others?

540
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,910
Raven.

541
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,910
We need to send the raven.

542
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,070
Get the maester! Now!

543
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,340
Thoros?

544
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,350
Thoros!

545
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,330
They say it's one of the better ways to go.

546
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,010
Lord of Light,

547
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,780
show us the way.

548
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,860
Come to us in our darkness

549
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,870
and lead your servant into the light.

550
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,060
We have to burn this body.

551
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,510
And all the clothes behind him.

552
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,820
Unless the Lord of Light is kind enough to send us a bit of fire.

553
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,860
Lord of Light.

554
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,990
Come to us in our darkness.

555
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,440
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

556
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,190
We'll all freeze soon.

557
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,120
I saw the water.

558
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,400
When you killed the white walker,

559
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,010
almost all the dead that followed fell.

560
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,130
Why?

561
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,080
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

562
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,050
We can go for the walkers.

563
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,360
- Maybe we'll stand a chance. - No.

564
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,210
We need to take that thing back with us.

565
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,460
There's a raven flying for Dragonstone now.

566
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:22,140
Daenerys is our only chance.

567
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,580
No.

568
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,850
There's another.

569
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,630
Kill him.

570
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,350
He turned them all.

571
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,340
You don't understand...

572
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,560
The Lord brought you back...

573
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,060
he brought me back...

574
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,630
No one else, just us.

575
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,980
Did he do it to watch us freeze to death?

576
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,420
Careful, Beric, you've lost your priest.

577
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,710
This is your last life.

578
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,810
I've been waiting for the end for a long time.

579
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,140
Maybe the Lord brought me here to find it.

580
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:05,360
Every Lord I've ever met it's been a cunt.

581
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,870
Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.

582
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,370
My lady.

583
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,830
My lady?

584
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,700
It's an invitation.

585
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,810
To King's Landing.

586
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,280
- My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell. - I am.

587
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,360
And you will represent my

588
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,830
interest at this gathering as you see them.

589
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,160
They invited you, they want you there.

590
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,620
I will not set foot in King's Landing while

591
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,770
Cersei Lannister is queen.

592
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,490
They want another Stark prisoner,

593
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,310
they can come and take me.

594
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,180
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

595
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,520
I have work to do here.

596
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,530
It's not safe.

597
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,460
Ser Jaime will be there.

598
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,820
You said he treated you honourably before.

599
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,980
I'm not worried about me.

600
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,110
It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.

601
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:28,150
I have many guards who'd happily imprison him or behead him

602
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,500
whether or not you're here.

603
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,240
And you trust their loyalty?

604
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,150
You trust he hasn't been speaking to them behind your back?

605
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,990
Let me at least leave Podrick behind to watch over you.

606
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,380
He has become a competent swordsman.

607
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,670
I do not need to be watched over or minded or cared for.

608
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,880
I'm not a child, I am the Lady of Winterfell and I am home.

609
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,060
This is the safest place for me.

610
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,400
My lady,

611
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,700
I sworn an oath to protect you and your sister.

612
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,420
If I abandon you...

613
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,610
The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne,

614
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,900
and you won't be travelling on summer roads.

615
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,240
The sooner you leave,

616
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,430
the better your chances of making it on time.

617
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,090
Yes, my lady.

618
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,660
You can't!

619
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,890
The most important person in the world

620
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,440
can't fly to the most dangerous place in the world.

621
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,470
- Who else can? - No one.

622
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,410
They knew the risk when they left.

623
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,480
You can't win the throne if you're dead.

624
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,470
You can't break the wheel if you're dead.

625
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:53,130
- So what would you have me do? - Nothing.

626
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,460
Sometimes nothing is the hardest thing to do.

627
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,480
If you die

628
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,710
we're all lost.

629
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,880
Everyone, everything...

630
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,420
You told me to do nothing before and I've listened to you.

631
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,900
I'm not doing nothing again.

632
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,790
Damn cunt.

633
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:34,550
Oh, fuck.

634
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,200
Fall back!

635
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,840
Fall back!

636
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,970
Come on!

637
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:41,540
Help me!

638
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:55,450
Jon!

639
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,060
Go!

640
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,120
Go now! Leave!

641
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,240
Uncle Benjen!

642
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,070
How?

643
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,920
You ride for the pass.

644
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,160
Come with me.

645
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,010
There's no time.

646
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,290
Go!

647
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,790
We'll meet again, Clegane.

648
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,470
Fucking hope not.

649
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,400
It's time to go, Your Grace.

650
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,650
A bit longer.

651
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,660
Ranger returning.

652
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,870
Open the gate.

653
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:13,210
Not what you're looking for?

654
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,660
I have hundreds of men here at Winterfell, all loyal to me.

655
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,180
They're not here now.

656
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,480
- What are these? - My faces.

657
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,920
- Where did you get them? - In Braavos,

658
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,650
while I was training to be a faceless man.

659
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:39,160
What does that mean?

660
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,640
Back in Braavos, before I got my first face,

661
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:50,400
there was I game I used to play. The game of faces.

662
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:55,130
It's simple: I ask you a question about yourself

663
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,820
and you try to make a lie sound like the truth.

664
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:01,090
If you fool me, you win.

665
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,640
If I catch a lie, you lose.

666
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,630
Let's play.

667
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:09,710
I don't want to play.

668
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:13,220
How do you feel about Jon being king?

669
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,890
Is there someone else

670
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,770
you feel should rule the North instead of him?

671
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:20,700
Those faces, what are they?

672
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:23,140
Is that what you should be asking?

673
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:25,580
Are you sure?

674
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,000
The game of faces didn't turn out so well

675
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,730
for the last person who asked me questions.

676
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,360
Tell me what they are!

677
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:37,570
We both wanted to be other people when we were younger.

678
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:40,760
You wanted to be a queen.

679
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:44,650
To sit next to a handsome young king on the Iron Throne.

680
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,750
I wanted to be a knight

681
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,420
to pick up a sword like father and go off to battle.

682
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:56,500
Neither of us got to be the other person, did we?

683
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,860
The world doesn't just

684
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,930
let girls decide what they are going to be.

685
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,610
But I can now. With the faces I can choose.

686
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,710
I can become someone else.

687
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,960
Speak in their voice, live in their skin.

688
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,920
I can even become you.

689
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:32,630
I wonder what it would feel like to wear those pretty dresses.

690
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,600
To be the Lady of Winterfell.

691
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,600
All I'd need to find out

692
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,120
is your face.

693
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,190
I'm sorry.

694
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:49,660
I'm so sorry.

695
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:03,160
I wish I could take it back.

696
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,360
I wish we'd never go.

697
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:12,110
I don't.

698
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:16,290
If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen.

699
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:20,180
You have to see it to know.

700
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:23,680
Now I know.

701
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,190
The dragons are my children.

702
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:34,200
They're the only children I'll ever have. Do you understand?

703
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:43,360
We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.

704
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,290
And we'll do it together.

705
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,950
You have my word.

706
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,270
Thank you, Dany.

707
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:57,880
Dany...

708
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,180
Who was the last person who called me that?

709
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,920
I'm not sure, was it my brother?

710
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,840
Not the company you want to keep.

711
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:12,270
Alright.

712
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,350
Not Dany.

713
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,510
How about "My Queen"?

714
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,330
I'd...

715
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,720
bend the knee but...

716
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,240
What about those who swore allegiance to you?

717
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:34,130
They'll all come to see you for what you are.

718
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:52,450
I hope I deserve it.

719
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:55,410
You do.

720
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,350
You should get some rest.

722
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,680
There is only one war that matters. And it is here.
