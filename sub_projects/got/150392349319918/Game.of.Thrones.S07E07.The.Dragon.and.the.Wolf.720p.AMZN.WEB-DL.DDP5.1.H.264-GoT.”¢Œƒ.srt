37
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,100
Little Theon! Come and get her.

38
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,650
It's an invitation... to King's Landing.

39
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,820
You will represent my interests at this gathering as you see them.

40
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,540
It's not safe leaving you with Littlefinger.

41
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,870
She's your sister.

42
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,980
Arya would never betray her family.

43
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,590
She would if she thought I was going to betray Jon.

44
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,050
With the faces, I can become someone else.

45
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,370
I wonder what it would feel like to be the Lady of Winterfell.

46
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,010
All I'd need to find out... is your face.

47
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,050
Daenerys will win this war.

48
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,510
If you want Cersei to bend the knee,

49
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,530
you can ask her yourself.

50
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,580
She has a more important request.

51
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,780
Cersei thinks the army of the dead is nothing but a story.

52
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,210
What if we prove her wrong?

53
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,560
Bring the dead to her.

54
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,920
Go!

55
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,620
We are going to destroy the Night King and his army.

56
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,560
Thank you, my queen.

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,930
- Oil? - Pitch, my lord.

59
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,960
- How many barrels? - 500, my lord.

60
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,470
Get 500 more.

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,380
Yes, my lord.

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,750
I still enjoy it when they call me "my lord."

63
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,440
The thrill will fade.

64
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,810
If we live that long.

65
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,100
Men without cocks.

66
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,040
You wouldn't find me fighting in an army

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,290
if I had no cock.

68
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,340
What's left to fight for?

69
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,120
Gold?

70
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,030
I spent my life around soldiers.

71
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,850
What do you think they spend that gold on?

72
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,540
Family.

73
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,070
Not without a cock, you don't.

74
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,140
Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.

75
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,640
Yet, your brother has chosen to side with the cockless.

76
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,280
Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.

77
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,540
I think we're about to be the downtrodden.

78
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,220
Archers, stand tall!

79
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,810
Cover that wall!

80
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,170
- How many people live here? - A million, give or take.

81
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,530
That's more people than the entire North crammed into that.

82
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,300
Why would anyone want to live that way?

83
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,930
There's more work in the city.

84
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,710
And the brothels are far superior.

85
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,400
Why isn't she with them?

86
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,260
I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace.

87
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,580
No one has seen her.

88
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,780
And the rest of them?

89
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,270
They're on their way to the Dragonpit now.

90
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,790
Including our brother?

91
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,460
Yes, Your Grace.

92
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,110
If anything goes wrong,

93
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,660
kill the silver-haired bitch first,

94
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,810
then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.

95
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,130
The rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit.

96
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,440
Come, Ser Gregor.

97
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,620
It's time for us to meet our guests.

98
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,960
Why did they build it?

99
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,290
Dragons don't understand the difference

100
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,340
between what is theirs and what isn't.

101
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,170
Land, livestock, children...

102
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,080
Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.

103
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,740
I imagine it was a sad joke at the end.

104
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,760
An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs.

105
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,670
But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread,

106
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,110
it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.

107
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,340
Maybe it still is.

108
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,890
Welcome, my lords.

109
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,690
Your friends arrived before you did.

110
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,800
I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.

111
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,410
A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.

112
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,880
I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.

113
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,680
Supporting the enemy, no less.

114
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,350
- Hard to blame you. - Cersei will anyway.

115
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,140
I'm glad you're alive.

116
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,050
Come on!

117
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,180
You can suck his magic cock later.

118
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,440
What's in there?

119
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,410
Fuck off.

120
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,620
I thought you were dead.

121
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,920
Not yet.

122
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,150
You came pretty close.

123
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,110
I was only trying to protect her.

124
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,410
You and me both.

125
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,320
She's alive.

126
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,610
Arya.

127
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,440
- Where? - Winterfell.

128
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,750
Who's protecting her if you're here?

129
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,220
The only one that needs protecting

130
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,940
is the one that gets in her way.

131
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,570
It won't be me.

132
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,500
Here we are--

133
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,440
the heroes of Blackwater Bay.

134
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,810
Strange place for a reunion.

135
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,020
It is, my lord.

136
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,840
I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick.

137
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,100
Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

138
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,270
I'm sure your new queen will be happy to restore yours

139
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,690
if she ends up on the throne.

140
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,580
You've been thinking about our new queen?

141
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,320
Perhaps you've been reconsidering your allegiances.

142
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,370
Remember my offer--

143
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,850
whatever they're paying you, I'll pay double.

144
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,510
And that would be double what now, exactly?

145
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,140
Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right.

146
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,580
- Looking after myself. - Are you?

147
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,080
Helping me to arrange this meeting

148
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,290
wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it?

149
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,370
You put yourself at risk.

150
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,210
I put yourself at risk. Important difference.

151
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,770
It's your head Queen Cersei's

152
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,760
offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine.

153
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,470
Now, thanks to me,

154
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,630
she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door.

155
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,280
She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired

156
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,810
of the clever words that pour out their pieholes.

157
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,040
All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.

158
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,920
If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.

159
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,710
It's good to see you again.

160
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,690
Yeah, you, too.

161
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,930
Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.

162
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,120
Come on, Pod.

163
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,870
Let's you and me go have a drink

164
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,050
while the fancy folks talk, eh?

165
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,330
I left this shit city

166
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,360
because I didn't want to die in it.

167
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,540
Am I going to die in this shit city?

168
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,660
You might.

169
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,630
And this is all your idea.

170
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,700
Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.

171
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,840
And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.

172
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,680
Remember me?

173
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,070
Yeah, you do.

174
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,800
You're even fucking uglier than I am now.

175
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,260
What did they do to you?

176
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,350
Doesn't matter.

177
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,540
That's not how it ends for you, brother.

178
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,080
You know who's coming for you.

179
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,520
You've always known.

180
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,600
Where is she?

181
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,900
She'll be here soon.

182
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,340
Didn't travel with you?

183
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:50,930
No.

184
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,840
We've been here for some time.

185
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,740
My apologies.

186
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,090
We are all facing a unique--

187
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,010
Theon!

188
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,880
I have your sister.

189
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,860
If you don't submit to me here, now...

190
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,290
I'll kill her.

191
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,650
I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.

192
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,050
Then why are you talking?

193
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,700
You're the smallest concern here.

194
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,700
Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes?

195
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,150
His wasn't even good.

196
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,300
He explained it at the end.

197
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,050
Never explain. It always ruins it.

198
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,880
We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know?

199
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,210
We kill you at birth.

200
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,200
An act of mercy for the parents.

201
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,570
Perhaps you ought to sit down.

202
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,740
Why?

203
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,080
Sit down or leave.

204
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,500
We are a group of people who do not like one another,

205
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,250
as this recent demonstration has shown.

206
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,020
We have suffered at each other's hands.

207
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,250
We have lost people we love at each other's hands.

208
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,450
If all we wanted was more of the same,

209
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,660
there would be no need for this gathering.

210
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,590
We are entirely capable of waging war against each other

211
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,470
without meeting face-to-face.

212
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,390
So instead, we should settle our differences

213
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,850
and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?

214
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,390
We all know that will never happen.

215
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,720
Then why are we here?

216
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,460
This isn't about living in harmony.

217
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,150
It's just about living.

218
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,950
The same thing is coming for all of us.

219
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,040
A general you can't negotiate with.

220
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,470
An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield.

221
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,120
Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city.

222
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,740
They're about to become a million more soldiers

223
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,060
in the Army of the Dead.

224
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,500
I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.

225
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,040
This is serious.

226
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,340
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

227
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,830
I don't think it's serious at all.

228
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,720
I think it's another bad joke.

229
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,140
If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly,

230
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,800
you're asking me for a truce.

231
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,610
Yes. That's all.

232
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,210
That's all?

233
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,260
Pull back my armies and stand down

234
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,150
while you go on your monster hunt.

235
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,850
Or while you solidify and expand your position.

236
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,490
Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back

237
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,860
until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.

238
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,490
Your capital will be safe

239
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,030
until the northern threat is dealt with.

240
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,940
You have my word.

241
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,890
The word of a would-be usurper.

242
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,980
There is no conversation

243
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,860
that will erase the last 50 years.

244
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,900
We have something to show you.

245
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,900
We can destroy them by burning them.

246
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,400
And we can destroy them with dragonglass.

247
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,880
If we don't win this fight,

248
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,940
then that is the fate of every person in the world.

249
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,970
There is only one war that matters--

250
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,000
the Great War.

251
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,530
And it is here.

252
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,950
I didn't believe it until I saw them.

253
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,470
I saw them all.

254
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,590
How many?

255
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,380
A hundred thousand, at least.

256
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,090
Can they swim?

257
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,150
No.

258
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,650
Good.

259
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,640
I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.

260
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,420
What are you talking about?

261
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,970
I've been around the world.

262
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,680
I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine,

263
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,640
and this...

264
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,940
this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.

265
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,130
I'm going back to my island.

266
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,040
You should go back to yours.

267
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,500
When winter's over,

268
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,840
we'll be the only ones left alive.

269
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,900
He's right to be afraid.

270
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,720
And a coward to run.

271
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,970
If those things come for us,

272
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,940
there will be no kingdoms to rule.

273
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,690
Everything we suffered will have been for nothing.

274
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,010
Everything we lost will have been for nothing.

275
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,180
The crown accepts your truce.

276
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,150
Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.

277
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,310
In return, the King in the North will extend this truce.

278
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,700
He will remain in the North where he belongs.

279
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,330
He will not take up arms against the Lannisters.

280
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,230
He will not choose sides.

281
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,230
Just the King in the North?

282
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,360
Not me?

283
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,730
I would never ask it of you.

284
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,620
You would never agree to it.

285
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,510
And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now.

286
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,000
I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.

287
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,620
I know Ned Stark's son will be true to his word.

288
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,060
I am true to my word.

289
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,240
Or I try to be.

290
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,050
That is why I cannot give you what you ask.

291
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,100
I cannot serve two queens.

292
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,150
And I have already pledged myself

293
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,680
to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

294
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,290
Then there is nothing left to discuss.

295
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,380
The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them.

296
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,080
We will deal with whatever is left of you.

297
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,270
Ser Jaime.

298
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,940
It's been good to see you.

299
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,320
I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.

300
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,940
We both saw what just happened.

301
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,780
We both saw that... thing.

302
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,250
Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them.

303
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,110
But I'm loyal to the queen,

304
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,980
and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.

305
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,620
Oh, fuck loyalty!

306
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,400
Fuck loyalty?

307
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,080
This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths.

308
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,380
Talk to the queen.

309
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,360
And tell her what?

310
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,200
I wish you hadn't done that.

311
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,580
I'm grateful for your loyalty,

312
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,440
but my dragon died so that we could be here.

313
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,950
If it's all for nothing,

314
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,950
then he died for nothing.

315
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,800
I know!

316
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,710
I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen.

317
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,360
I would have advised it, had you asked.

318
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,900
But have you ever considered learning how to lie every now and then?

319
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,210
Just a bit?

320
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,310
I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold.

321
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,510
Talk about my father if you want,

322
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,690
tell me that's the attitude that got him killed.

323
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,390
But when enough people make false promises,

324
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,390
words stop meaning anything.

325
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,840
Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies.

326
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,460
And lies won't help us in this fight.

327
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,510
That is indeed a problem.

328
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,140
The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.

329
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,770
Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?

330
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,400
Only one.

331
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,190
Everyone stays here,

332
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,020
and I go and talk to my sister.

333
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,230
I didn't come all this way to have my Hand murdered.

334
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,230
I don't want Cersei to murder me either.

335
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,110
I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.

336
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,230
I did this.

337
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,790
- I should go. - She'll definitely murder you.

338
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,190
I go see my sister alone.

339
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,760
Or we all go home

340
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,850
and we're right back where we started.

341
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:50,280
- You spoke with her? - At her until she kicked me out.

342
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,980
She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.

343
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,360
A lot of people seem to think that, actually.

344
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,860
I'm about to step into a room

345
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,600
with the most murderous woman in the world

346
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,360
who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of.

347
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,920
Who's an idiot?

348
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,700
I suppose we should say goodbye,

349
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,700
one idiot to another.

350
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,350
I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.

351
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,760
She's your kind of woman--

352
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,460
a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.

353
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:21,080
A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate.

354
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,230
That must be difficult for you.

355
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,740
So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,

356
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,610
whom you've convinced to bow down before her.

357
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,110
I didn't know about that.

358
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,760
And now you've got them both working towards the same goal,

359
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,790
the goal you've worked towards your entire life...

360
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,350
- Cersei, I didn't know. - ...the destruction of this family.

361
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,060
I am the one preventing that from happening.

362
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,630
Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate.

363
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,240
She didn't want to bring you words.

364
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
She wanted to bring you fire and blood

365
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,300
until I advised her otherwise.

366
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,020
I don't want to destroy our family.

367
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,420
I never have.

368
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,580
You killed our father.

369
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,090
After he sentenced me to death

370
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,040
for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him.

371
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,480
Hate me for it if you want.

372
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,860
I hate myself for it in spite of what he was,

373
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,750
in spite of what he did to me.

374
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,810
Oh, poor little man.

375
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,880
Your papa was mean to you.

376
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,660
Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow?

377
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,990
You left us open.

378
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,100
You laid us bare for the vultures,

379
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,580
and the vultures came and tore us apart.

380
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,310
You may not have killed Joffrey,

381
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,360
but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen.

382
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,110
No one would've touched them if Father was here.

383
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,720
No one would have dared--

384
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,860
I have never been more sorry about anything.

385
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,550
I will not hear it, not from you.

386
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,110
I will not hear it!

387
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
All right.

388
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,320
You love your family,

389
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,650
and I have destroyed it.

390
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,180
I will always be a threat.

391
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,260
So put an end to me.

392
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,440
If it weren't for me, you'd have a mother.

393
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,130
If it weren't for me, you'd have a father.

394
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,110
If it weren't for me,

395
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,640
you'd have two beautiful children.

396
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,640
I've thought about killing you

397
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,780
more times than I can count.

398
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,090
Do it! Say the word.

399
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,410
I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.

400
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,110
- I will not-- - I don't care. I loved them.

401
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,690
You know I did.

402
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:28,020
You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.

403
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,000
It doesn't matter.

404
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,750
Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter.

405
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,370
I don't care why you did what you did.

406
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,370
I only care what it cost us.

407
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,960
It cost us our future.

408
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,470
If there's no future, then why are we here?

409
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,630
Why did you allow me to come?

410
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,490
Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.

411
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,240
Yes, no, not what you hoped for,

412
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,470
but you must have hoped for something.

413
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,220
What did you hope for?

414
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,150
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen? - Mm, not like this.

415
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,280
But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.

416
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,420
- Yes. - Why?

417
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,720
Because I think she will make the world a better place.

418
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,530
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

419
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,990
She knows herself.

420
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,880
She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses

421
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,220
instead of feeding them.

422
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,370
That's the difference between you.

423
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,650
I don't care about checking my worst impulses.

424
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,190
I don't care about making the world a better place.

425
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,230
Hang the world.

426
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,790
That thing you dragged here,

427
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,300
I know what it is, I know what it means.

428
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,110
And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world.

429
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,010
Not at all.

430
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,660
As soon as it opened its mouth,

431
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,060
the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat.

432
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,600
All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth

433
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,200
away from the ones who matter most,

434
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,550
away from my family.

435
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,210
Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea.

436
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,380
Get on a boat, take those who matter--

437
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,770
You're pregnant.

438
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,680
No one is less happy about this than I am.

439
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,030
I know.

440
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,350
I respect what you did.

441
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,860
Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.

442
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,890
This place was the beginning of the end for my family.

444
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,940
A dragon is not a slave.

445
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,520
They were terrifying.

446
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,140
Extraordinary.

447
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,370
They filled people with wonder and awe,

448
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,720
and we locked them in here.

449
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,540
They wasted away.

450
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,190
They grew small.

451
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,420
And we grew small as well.

452
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,990
We weren't extraordinary without them.

453
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,080
We were just like everyone else.

454
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,480
You're not like everyone else.

455
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,700
And your family hasn't seen its end.

456
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,400
You're still here.

457
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
I can't have children.

458
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,980
Who told you that?

459
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,890
The witch who murdered my husband.

460
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,980
Has it occurred to you she might not have been

461
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,270
a reliable source of information?

462
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,250
You were right from the beginning.

463
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,670
If I had trusted you, everything would be different.

464
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,060
So, what now?

465
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,870
I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall.

466
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,810
And I can't pretend that Cersei

467
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,470
won't take back half the country the moment I march north.

468
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,750
It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct.

469
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,740
We're fucked.

470
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,280
My armies will not stand down.

471
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,210
I will not pull them back to the capital.

472
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:46,060
I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War.

473
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,390
The darkness is coming for us all.

474
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,760
We'll face it together.

475
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,240
And when the Great War is over,

476
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,520
perhaps you'll remember I chose to help

477
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,790
with no promises or assurances from any of you.

478
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,860
I expect not.

479
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,760
Call our banners.

480
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,370
All of them.

481
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,800
It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms.

482
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,330
Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.

483
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,570
No, this is the way he is,

484
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,120
the way he's always been.

485
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,770
He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?

486
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,210
I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown

487
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,290
without consulting you.

488
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,890
This is his writing, his signature.

489
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,700
He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen.

490
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,220
He's bent the knee.

491
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,190
I've heard gossip

492
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,900
that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.

493
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,760
What does that have to do with anything?

494
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,160
Jon is young and unmarried.

495
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,120
Daenerys is young and unmarried.

496
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,930
You think he wants to marry her?

497
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,270
An alliance makes sense.

498
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,260
Together, they'd be difficult to defeat.

499
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,640
He was named King in the North.

500
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,980
He can be unnamed.

501
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,560
Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along.

502
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,370
She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me,

503
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,370
and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.

504
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,930
You are family, too.

505
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,670
Would Arya really murder her own sister?

506
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,310
Do you know what she is now?

507
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,860
Do you know what the Faceless Men are?

508
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,180
Only by reputation.

509
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,980
They worship the God of Death, I believe.

510
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,680
I never trust godly men.

511
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,770
They're killers.

512
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,220
And Arya was one of them.

513
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,470
What do you think she's after?

514
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,690
She's your sister.

515
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,470
You know her far better than I ever could.

516
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,510
Sometimes when I try to understand a person's motives,

517
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,850
I play a little game.

518
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,560
I assume the worst.

519
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,000
What's the worst reason they could possibly have

520
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,510
for saying what they say and doing what they do?

521
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,320
Then I ask myself,

522
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,560
"How well does that reason explain

523
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,100
what they say and what they do?"

524
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,060
So, tell me--

525
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,290
what's the worst thing she could want?

526
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,340
She could want me dead

527
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,310
because she thinks I wronged my family.

528
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,380
Why did she come to Winterfell?

529
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,580
To kill me

530
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,310
for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.

531
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,650
Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?

532
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,700
To provide proof of my betrayals.

533
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,150
To provide justification after she murders me.

534
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,710
And after she murders you,

535
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,640
what does she become?

536
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,050
Lady of Winterfell.

537
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:02,570
If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad,

538
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,960
they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.

539
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,240
And the Unsullied?

540
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,080
We can sail with them to White Harbor,

541
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,700
meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad,

542
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,050
then ride together to Winterfell.

543
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,880
Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace.

544
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,130
You have many enemies in the North.

545
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,670
Thousands fell fighting your father.

546
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,200
All it takes is one angry man with a crossbow.

547
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,760
He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad

548
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:30,860
and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero.

549
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,570
The man who killed the conqueror.

550
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,490
It's your decision, Your Grace.

551
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,380
But if we're going to be allies in this war,

552
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,340
it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies.

553
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,470
If we sail to White Harbor together,

554
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,100
I think it sends a better message.

555
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,350
I've not come to conquer the North.

556
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,970
I'm coming to save the North.

557
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,730
We sail together.

558
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:23,900
Jon.

559
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:27,660
Can I speak with you?

560
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:31,820
All right.

561
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,520
What you did in King's Landing,

562
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:42,380
what you said...

563
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,030
you could've lied to Cersei

564
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,320
about bending the knee to Daenerys.

565
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,550
You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.

566
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,600
We went down there to make peace.

567
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,430
And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other

568
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,030
if we're going to fight together.

569
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,440
You've always known what was right.

570
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,970
Even when we were all young and stupid,

571
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,920
you always knew.

572
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,440
Every step you take...

573
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,640
it's always the right step.

574
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,830
It's not.

575
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,200
It may seem that way from the outside,

576
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,760
but I promise you, it's not true.

577
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,740
I've done plenty of things that I regret.

578
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,540
Not compared to me, you haven't.

579
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,570
No.

580
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,450
Not compared to you.

581
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,060
I always wanted to do the right thing.

582
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,070
Be the right kind of person.

583
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,570
But I never knew what that meant.

584
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,320
It always seemed like there's...

585
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,360
like there was an impossible choice I had to make.

586
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,180
Stark or Greyjoy.

587
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,960
Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was.

588
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,090
- He was. - And you betrayed him.

589
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,750
Betrayed his memory.

590
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,870
I did.

591
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,240
But you never lost him.

592
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,840
He's a part of you.

593
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,920
Just like he's a part of me.

594
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,900
But the things I've done...

595
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,050
It's not my place to forgive you for all of it.

596
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,700
But what I can forgive,

597
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,910
I do.

598
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,480
You don't need to choose.

599
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,810
You're a Greyjoy...

600
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,960
and you're a Stark.

601
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,160
When I was Ramsay's prisoner,

602
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,700
Yara tried to save me.

603
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,010
She's the only one

604
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,480
who tried to save me.

605
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,210
She needs me now.

606
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,700
So, why are you still talking to me?

607
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,020
Load up.

608
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,920
Load up, lads. Go on.

609
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,900
Tide's coming in.

610
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,320
All of us chose to follow Yara.

611
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,510
We left the Iron Islands for Yara.

612
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:44,030
She would never leave one of us behind.

613
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,080
We're not leaving her behind.

614
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,400
Your sister's dead.

615
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,230
- She's not dead. - She's dead.

616
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,280
Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.

617
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,460
She's our queen. 

618
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,870
She's your sister, and you left her to die.

619
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,280
I did.

620
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,970
I ran from my uncle.

621
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,530
I was a coward.

622
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,670
So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you?

623
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,320
They say the dead can't swim.

624
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,970
We're going to sail east,

625
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,090
find a nice, quiet island,

626
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,470
kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.

627
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,710
- We're done with all that. - Who says we are?

628
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,570
Yara did. She made a pledge.

629
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,180
We're going to find her,

630
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,410
and we're going to set her free.

631
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,140
Run away, little Theon.

632
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,690
It's what you do best.

633
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:53,360
He needs to shut his mouth.

634
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:08,520
yes!

635
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,700
That's more like it.

636
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,530
Stay down...

637
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,910
or I'll kill you!

638
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,240
I said stay down or I'll kill you!

639
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,320
Not for me.

640
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:06,300
For Yara!

641
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,210
Yara!

642
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,780
Have my sister brought to the Great Hall.

643
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,380
Are you sure you want to do this?

644
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,030
It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.

645
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,000
And what does honor demand?

646
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,500
That I defend my family from those who would harm us.

647
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,550
That I defend the North from those who would betray us.

648
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,040
All right, then.

649
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:05,270
Get on with it.

650
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,440
You stand accused of murder.

651
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,740
You stand accused of treason.

652
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,690
How do you answer these charges...

653
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,070
Lord Baelish?

654
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,860
My sister asked you a question.

655
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,010
Lady Sansa, forgive me...

656
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,300
I'm a bit confused.

657
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,310
Which charges confuse you?

658
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:51,440
Let's start with the simplest one.

659
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,520
you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.

660
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,910
You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall.

661
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,280
Do you deny it?

662
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,440
I did it to protect you.

663
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,540
You did it to take power in the Vale.

664
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,860
Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon Arryn.

665
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,190
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys to poison him.

666
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,510
Do you deny it?

667
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:15,780
Whatever your aunt might have told you...

668
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,820
she was a troubled woman.

669
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,510
She imagined enemies everywhere.

670
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:24,290
You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents

671
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,670
telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

672
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,110
when, really, it was you.

673
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,470
The conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters,

674
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:31,900
it was you who started it.

675
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,030
Do you deny it?

676
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,280
I know of no such letter.

677
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,530
You conspired with Cersei Lannister

678
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:40,320
and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father, Ned Stark.

679
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,050
Thanks to your treachery, he was imprisoned

680
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:46,360
and later executed on false charges of treason.

681
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,090
- Do you deny it? - I deny it!

682
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,580
None of you were there to see what happened.

683
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,250
None of you knows the truth.

684
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,040
You held a knife to his throat.

685
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,040
You said, "I did warn you not the trust me."

686
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:11,480
You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

687
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,160
But that was another one of your lies.

688
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:16,890
It was yours.

689
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,450
Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl.

690
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,690
- I've protected you. - Protected me?

691
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,260
By selling me to the Boltons?

692
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,730
If we could speak alone,

693
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,270
I can explain everything.

694
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,430
Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives,

695
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,010
I play a little game.

696
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,580
I assume the worst.

697
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,900
What's the worst reason you have

698
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,940
for turning me against my sister?

699
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:53,840
That's what you do, isn't it?

700
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,630
That's what you've always done--

701
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,400
turn family against family,

702
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,380
turn sister against sister.

703
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,760
That's what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

704
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,810
and that's what you tried to do to us.

705
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,210
Sansa, please.

706
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,050
I'm a slow learner, it's true.

707
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:10,340
But I learn.

708
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,320
Give me a chance to defend myself.

709
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,230
I deserve that.

710
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,170
I am Lord Protector of the Vale

711
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,760
and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.

712
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,140
I think not.

713
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:30,980
Sansa, I beg you!

714
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,510
I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.

715
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,460
And yet, you betrayed her.

716
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,510
I loved you.

717
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:42,970
More than anyone.

718
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,370
And yet, you betrayed me.

719
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,580
When you brought me back to Winterfell,

720
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,960
you told me there's no justice in the world,

721
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,880
not unless we make it.

722
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:00,310
Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish.

723
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,330
I will never forget them.

724
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,460
Sansa!

725
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:16,560
I...

726
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:41,170
Our men in King's Landing

727
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,980
will march north in three days' time.

728
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,110
It'll take us a fortnight

729
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,900
just to gather supplies for the train.

730
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,150
We don't have a fortnight.

731
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,170
If the North falls, we fall. Three days.

732
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:50,620
The remaining forces in the Westerlands

733
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,360
will take the river road east.

734
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:53,770
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town

735
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,950
and march together to Winterfell.

736
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,050
Ser Jaime.

737
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,030
Your Grace.

738
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,020
My lords, I need a moment with my brother.

739
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,930
Your Grace.

740
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:12,700
- What are you doing? - Preparing the expedition north.

741
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,060
Expedition north?

742
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,730
I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister.

743
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,100
The Starks and Targaryens have united against us,

744
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,240
and you want to fight alongside them?

745
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,250
Are you a traitor or an idiot?

746
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,100
You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy--

747
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,640
I'll say whatever I need to say

748
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,580
to ensure the survival of our house.

749
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,260
You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father?

750
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:36,580
You expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum,

751
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,500
to fight for the Dragon Queen?

752
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,110
You saw it with your own eyes.

753
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,150
You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

754
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,860
And I saw it burn.

755
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:46,230
If dragons can't stop them,

756
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:49,350
if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them,

757
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,230
how will our armies make a difference?

758
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:53,270
This isn't about noble houses,

759
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,520
this is about the living and the dead!

760
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,670
And I intend to stay amongst the living.

761
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,930
Let the Stark boy and his new queen defend the North.

762
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,920
We stay here where we've always been.

763
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,870
I made a promise.

764
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:11,070
Our child will rule Westeros.

765
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:15,510
Our child will never be born if the dead come south.

766
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,290
The monsters are real.

767
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,500
The white walkers,

768
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,300
the dragons, the Dothraki screamers--

769
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,410
all the frightening stories

770
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,430
we heard when we were young, they're all real.

771
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,570
So be it.

772
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,340
Let the monsters kill each other.

773
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,730
And while they battle in the North,

774
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,260
we take back the lands that belong to us.

775
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,130
- And then what? - And then we rule.

776
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,790
When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins.

777
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,740
You understand that, don't you?

778
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:46,100
If the dead win, they march south and kill us all.

779
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,790
If the living win, and we've betrayed them,

780
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:51,000
they march south and kill us all!

781
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,860
The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all.

782
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,080
Most of them will die in the North.

783
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:56,790
I faced them in the field.

784
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,940
We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.

785
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,820
How many dragons did you see at the pit?

786
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,680
- Two. - What happened to the third?

787
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,920
For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!

788
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,930
She came here with her dragons

789
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,590
and her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

790
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:10,570
She came here to show us all her power.

791
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:14,630
No, something happened. The dragons are vulnerable.

792
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:17,090
We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers.

793
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,950
We don't have the support of the other houses!

794
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:21,700
No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank.

795
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,550
You should've listened more

796
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:27,430
when Father spoke about the importance of gold.

797
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,300
Oh, I know it's boring for you.

798
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,580
You just wanted to hunt and ride and fight.

799
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:35,000
But I listened, I learned.

800
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,560
Highgarden bought us the most powerful army in Essos--

801
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,360
the Golden Company.

802
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,380
20,000 men, horses, elephants, I believe.

803
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,180
The Golden Company is not here.

804
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,340
They're in Essos.

805
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:52,440
How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?

806
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,780
Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail

807
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,820
and sailed back to the Iron Islands?

808
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:00,830
Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?

809
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,060
No one walks away from me.

810
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,010
He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.

811
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,150
He's going to ferry the Golden Company back here

812
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:12,300
to help us win the war for Westeros.

813
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,320
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me,

814
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,520
the commander of your armies?

815
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,590
And you conspired with Tyrion,

816
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,080
the man who murdered our father,

817
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,350
without telling me, your queen.

818
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,530
I didn't conspire with him.

819
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:27,880
You met with him in secret without my consent.

820
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,950
You planned to promote my enemies' interests.

821
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,210
That is the definition of conspiracy.

822
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:34,490
I pledged to ride north.

823
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:36,650
I intend to honor that pledge.

824
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,590
- And that will be treason. - Treason?

825
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:40,870
Disobeying your queen's command, fighting with her enemies.

826
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,520
What would you call it?

827
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,390
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

828
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,440
I told you no one walks away from me.

829
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,050
Are you going to order him to kill me?

830
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,870
I'm the only one you have left.

831
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,190
Our children are gone, our father is gone.

832
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,030
It's just me and you now.

833
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:10,920
There's one more yet to come.

834
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,170
Give the order, then.

835
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:36,780
I don't believe you.

836
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,840
Come in.

837
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:32,720
Samwell Tarly.

838
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,080
I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

839
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,770
I remember everything.

840
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:46,870
You helped us get beyond the Wall.

841
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,600
- You're a good man. - Oh, well, thank you,

842
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,660
but, um, I'm not sure that I am.

843
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,450
What happened to you beyond the Wall?

844
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,940
I became the Three-Eyed Raven.

845
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:09,200
I don't know what that means.

846
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,660
I can see things that happened in the past.

847
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,880
I can see things happening now

848
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,090
all over the world.

849
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,160
Why did you come to Winterfell?

850
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:29,240
Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead.

851
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,420
I know he is.

852
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,900
But he can't do it alone,

853
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:35,800
so I've come here to help him.

854
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,500
He's on his way back to Winterfell

855
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,880
with Daenerys Targaryen.

856
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,680
You-- you saw this in--

857
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,240
in a vision?

858
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,620
He needs to know the truth.

859
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,360
The truth about what?

860
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,880
About himself.

861
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,600
No one knows. No one but me.

862
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,970
Jon isn't really my father's son.

863
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:08,720
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen

864
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,100
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

865
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:13,940
He was born in a tower in Dorne.

866
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,660
His last name isn't really Snow,

867
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,260
it's Sand.

868
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,720
It's not.

869
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:25,300
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

870
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:28,850
At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary.

871
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:32,230
He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.

872
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,830
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.

873
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:39,210
Are you certain?

874
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:41,940
It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary.

875
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,680
I don't know why he'd lie.

876
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,480
Is this something you can see?

877
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:53,350
Father, Smith, Warrior,

878
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:58,390
Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.

879
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:01,770
- I am hers and she is mine... - I am his and he is mine...

880
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,260
from this day until the end of my days.

881
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:09,530
Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie.

882
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:14,820
Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt or rape her.

883
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:25,470
He loved her.

884
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,000
And she loved him.

885
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,930
And Jon...

886
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:08,420
Jon's real name...

887
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,330
His name is Aegon Targaryen.

888
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,040
You have to protect him.

889
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,140
Promise me, Ned.

890
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,290
He's never been a bastard.

891
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:51,710
He's the heir to the Iron Throne.

892
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,370
He needs to know.

893
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,280
We need to tell him.

894
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:25,310
Are you all right?

895
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,640
It's just strange.

896
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,620
In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.

897
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:38,230
You did the right thing.

898
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:39,480
You did it.

899
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,440
I'm just the executioner.

900
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:44,420
You passed the sentence.

901
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,380
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

902
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,750
Does that bother you?

903
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,020
I was never going to be as good a lady as you.

904
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,440
So I had to be something else.

905
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,800
I never could have survived what you survived.

906
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,270
You would have.

907
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,430
You're the strongest person I know.

908
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,360
I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

909
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,720
Well, don't get used to it.

910
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,720
You're still very strange and annoying.

911
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,490
"In winter, we must protect ourselves.

912
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,310
Look after one another."

913
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,090
Father.

914
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:45,190
"When the snows fall and the white winds blow,

915
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,760
the lone wolf dies,

916
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:50,100
but the pack survives."

917
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:58,470
I miss him.

918
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:02,970
Me, too.

919
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,260
It's a long way down.

920
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,790
Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.

921
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:42,700
I can see movement...

922
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:45,290
Watch, on the tree line!

923
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:47,690
What is it?

924
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:20,730
Come on!

925
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,060
Run! Run!
