40
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,260
Clegane, look into the flames.

41
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,250
What do you see?

42
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,400
A wall of ice.

43
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,420
The Wall.

44
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,110
The only thing standing between us

45
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,740
and the army of the dead is the Wall,

46
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,930
and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries.

47
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,400
Last time we saw The Night King, it was at Hardhome.

48
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,660
Closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch by the sea.

49
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,460
And that's where I'll go.

50
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,410
Looks like we're the Nightswatch now.

51
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,740
This suits you, Lady Stark.

52
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,310
- Jon left you in charge? - He did.

53
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,150
- Lord Tarly. - I believe you know my son.

54
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,790
Do you fight with us

55
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,150
or with the fallen savages and eunuchs?

56
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,080
What do you think I should do?

57
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,120
If you use them to melt castles and burn cities,

58
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,340
you're not different.

59
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,140
You're just more of the same.

60
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,900
Listen.

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,030
You could've killed me.

62
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,120
The fuck were you doing back there?

63
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,890
Ending the war.

64
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,470
Killing her.

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,330
You saw the dragon between you and her?

66
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,170
And?

67
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,250
Listen to me, cunt.

68
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,220
Till I get what I'm owed,

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,050
a dragon doesn't get to kill you,

70
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,710
you don't get to kill you,

71
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,880
only I get to kill you.

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,680
That was only one of them.

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,120
She has two more.

74
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,650
If she decides to use them, to really use them...

75
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,980
- You're fucked. - Don't you mean we're fucked?

76
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,200
No, I do not.

77
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,350
Dragons are where our partnership ends.

78
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,850
I'm not gonna be around when those things

79
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,870
start spitting fire on King's Landing.

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,080
I have to tell Cersei.

81
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,780
May as well jump back in that river.

82
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,630
I know what Cersei has told you.

83
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,010
That I've come to destroy your cities,

84
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,140
burn down your homes,

85
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,250
murder you, and orphan your children.

86
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,590
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

87
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,390
I'm not here to murder,

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,640
and all I want to destroy

89
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,800
is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor

90
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,450
to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.

91
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,880
I offer you a choice--

92
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,520
bend the knee and join me.

93
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,570
Together, we will leave

94
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,010
the world a better place than we found it.

95
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,640
Or refuse...

96
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,920
and die.

97
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,660
Step forward, my lord.

98
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,590
You will not kneel?

99
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,430
I already have a queen.

100
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,790
My sister.

101
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,910
She wasn't your queen until recently, though, was she?

102
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,520
When she murdered your rightful queen

103
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,100
and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,850
So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.

105
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,880
There are no easy choices in war.

106
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,640
Say what you will about your sister,

107
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,630
she was born in Westeros.

108
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,460
She's lived here all her life.

109
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,350
You, on the other hand,

110
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,530
murdered your own father

111
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,270
and chose to support a foreign invader.

112
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,840
One with no ties to this land...

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,380
with an army of savages at her back.

114
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
You will not trade your honor for your life.

115
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,960
I respect that.

116
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,330
Perhaps he could take the Black, Your Grace.

117
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,960
Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.

118
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,860
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

119
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,910
You cannot send me to the Wall.

120
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,620
You are not my queen.

121
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,500
You will have to kill me, too.

122
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
Step back and shut your mouth.

123
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,640
Who are you?

124
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,390
A stupid boy.

125
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,760
I am Dickon Tarly,

126
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,150
son of Randyll Tarly.

127
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,440
You are the future of your house.

128
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,560
This war has already wiped one great house from the world.

129
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,790
Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.

130
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,110
I will not.

131
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,650
Your Grace, nothing scrubs bold notions from a man's head

132
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,390
like a few weeks in a dark cell.

133
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,970
I meant what I said.

134
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,520
I'm not here to put men in chains.

135
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,840
If that becomes an option, many will take it.

136
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,280
I gave them a choice.

137
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,240
They made it.

138
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,220
Your Grace, if you start beheading entire families--

139
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,780
I'm not beheading anyone.

140
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,440
Your Grace.

141
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,430
Lord Randyll Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

142
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,220
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name,

143
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,930
Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons,

144
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,610
sentence you to die.

145
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,810
Dracarys.

146
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,630
My-- my lord...

147
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,860
How many men did we lose?

148
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,890
We haven't done a full accounting.

149
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,160
It's not only armies that win wars.

150
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,650
We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.

151
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,370
We can buy mercenaries.

152
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,340
Not the same as our men, but they'll fight

153
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,490
if they're well paid, which they will be.

154
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,910
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

155
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,710
They'll beat any mercenary army.

156
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,670
They'll beat any army I've ever seen.

157
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,380
Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.

158
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,730
Her dragon burnt a thousand wagons.

159
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,910
Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.

160
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,310
They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them.

161
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,420
This isn't a war we can win.

162
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,590
So, what do we do?

163
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,490
Sue for peace?

164
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,390
I sit on her father's throne,

165
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,590
the father you betrayed and murdered.

166
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,040
And in her mind, she's winning.

167
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,020
What sort of offer do you think she'd make?

168
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,580
Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf

169
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,660
by way of apology for murdering our father and son.

170
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,170
He didn't.

171
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,180
You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.

172
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,040
I'm not talking about Father.

173
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,250
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.

174
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,260
After all this time,

175
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,410
- it still amazes me that you-- - It was Olenna.

176
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,500
She confessed before she died.

177
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,470
And this was before or after

178
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,430
she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?

179
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,870
After.

180
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,150
And you believed her?

181
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,370
If you were Olenna, would you rather have seen

182
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,300
your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?

183
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,750
Which one would Margaery have been better able to control?

184
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,930
Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

185
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,690
She was telling the truth.

186
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,220
I shouldn't have listened to you.

187
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,210
She should have died screaming.

188
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,560
She's dead, like her son,

189
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,480
her grandchildren, her whole house.

190
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,530
And if we don't find a way out of this war,

191
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,140
we'll follow them.

192
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,400
So we fight and die or we submit and die.

193
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,980
I know my choice.

194
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,610
A soldier should know his.

195
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,770
They're beautiful, aren't they?

196
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,030
It wasn't the word I was thinking of, but...

197
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,630
but, yes, they are.

198
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,010
Gorgeous beasts.

199
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,620
They're not beasts to me.

200
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,590
No matter how big they get

201
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,650
or how terrifying to everyone else,

202
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,470
they're my children.

203
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,440
You weren't gone long.

204
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:30,940
No.

205
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,540
And?

206
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,510
And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.

207
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,210
You're not sure how you feel about that.

208
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,220
No, I'm not.

209
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,510
How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?

210
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,420
Thousands.

211
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,430
We both want to help people.

212
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,750
We can only help them from a position of strength.

213
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,400
Sometimes strength is terrible.

214
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,300
When you first came here,

215
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,670
Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.

216
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,150
Ser Davos gets carried away.

217
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,400
So, it was a figure of speech?

220
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,190
Your Grace.

221
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,470
Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,

222
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,640
an old friend.

223
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,890
I served with your father.

224
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,150
He was a great man.

225
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,070
You look strong.

226
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,520
You found a cure?

227
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,440
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

228
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,680
I return to your service, my queen,

229
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,460
if you'll have me.

230
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,930
It would be my honor.

231
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,490
Ravens.

232
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,610
We need to send ravens.

233
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,310
I put very little stock in it myself.

234
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,600
Prophecies of doom are never in short supply,

235
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,170
especially when winter comes.

236
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,470
I remember Wolkan.

237
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,430
A little timid, but a sharp mind.

238
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,640
Eh, the North has dulled many good maesters' wits.

239
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,160
Hard to say whether it's the cold, the drink,

240
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,580
or the company.

241
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,040
A crippled boy claims to have seen

242
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,030
dead men on the march beyond the Wall,

243
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,810
thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes?

244
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,370
Yes, it is a bit much.

245
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,750
- Still, we ought to write back-- - Brandon Stark.

246
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,950
- The crippled boy. - Do you know him?

247
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,660
I led him through the Wall years ago.

248
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,930
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

249
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,950
And?

250
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,450
Somehow, a crippled boy

251
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,230
survived for years beyond the Wall when no one else could.

252
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,720
Not the Night's Watch, not the wildlings, no one.

253
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,030
Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.

254
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,320
Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.

255
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,110
I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming?

256
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,090
Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.

257
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,590
If you tell people the threat is real, they'll believe it.

258
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
If you advise all the lords to send their men north

259
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,650
to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

260
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,150
And if you tell every maester in the Citadel

261
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,280
to search every word of every faded scroll

262
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,000
about the Long Night,

263
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,960
they may find something that lets us defeat

264
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,810
the Army of the Dead for good.

265
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,660
It could be done.

266
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,350
And this news could be authentic.

267
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,820
It's possible.

268
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,810
It's also possible that this message

269
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,210
is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen

270
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,550
to lure southern armies away

271
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,120
from the lands they are currently defending

272
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,470
to open those lands to easy conquest.

273
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,600
That does seem far more likely

274
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,020
than magic birds talking to cripples.

275
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,670
Archmaester, please.

276
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,440
It's real.

277
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,890
I've seen it.

278
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,930
We will write to Maester Wolkan

279
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,980
at Winterfell for clarification.

280
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,300
I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.

281
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,910
- Archmaester, please-- - That will be all, Tarly.

282
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,540
It brings to mind the work of Jenny of Oldstones,

283
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,620
the charlatan who claimed

284
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,140
descent from the children of the forest.

285
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,450
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

286
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,590
who promised that the Drowned

287
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,680
God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

288
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,330
Ah, Lodos.

289
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,210
Is he the one whose father and brother were just burnt alive?

290
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,090
I'm afraid so.

291
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,980
Horrible business.

292
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,230
I haven't had the heart to tell him yet.

293
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,150
He's a good lad.

294
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,270
Right.

295
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,650
The ravenry was falling apart the last time I checked.

296
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,190
All rulers demand that people bend the knee.

297
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,750
That's why they're rulers.

298
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,350
She gave Tarly a choice,

299
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,700
a man who had taken up arms against her.

300
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,010
What else could she do?

301
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,240
Not burn him alive alongside his son?

302
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,520
I am her Hand, not her head.

303
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,850
I can't make her decisions for her.

304
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,660
That's what I used to tell myself about her father.

305
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,090
I found the traitors, but I wasn't the one burning them alive.

306
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,410
I was only a purveyor of information.

307
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,110
It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy--

308
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,390
I'm not the one doing it.

309
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,250
When the pitch of their screams rose higher--

310
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,580
I'm not the one doing it.

311
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,970
When their hair caught fire

312
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,350
and the smell of their burning flesh filled the throne room--

313
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,970
I'm not the one doing it.

314
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,460
Daenerys is not her father.

315
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,990
And she never will be

316
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,760
with the right counsel.

317
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,010
You need to find a way to make her listen.

318
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,990
- Who's that for? - Jon Snow.

319
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,060
Did you read it?

320
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,310
It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.

321
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,630
What's it say?

322
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,930
Nothing good.

323
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,570
I thought Arya was dead.

324
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,390
I thought Bran was dead.

325
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,820
I'm happy for you.

326
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,630
You don't look happy.

327
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,540
Bran saw the Night King and his army

328
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,700
marching towards Eastwatch.

329
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
If they make it past the Wall...

330
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,750
The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years, presumably.

331
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,240
I need to go home.

332
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,320
You said you don't have enough men.

333
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,260
We'll fight with the men we have.

334
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,540
Unless you'll join us.

335
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,620
And give the country to Cersei?

336
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,300
As soon as I march away, she marches in.

337
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,900
Perhaps not.

338
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,320
Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story

339
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,040
made up by wet nurses to frighten children.

340
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,650
What if we prove her wrong?

341
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,360
I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.

342
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,390
So bring the dead to her.

343
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,780
I thought that was what we were trying to avoid.

344
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,600
We don't have to bring the whole army.

345
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,430
Only one soldier.

346
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,570
Is that possible?

347
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,100
The first wight I ever saw

348
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,560
was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.

349
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,590
Bring one of these things down to King's Landing

350
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,430
and show her the truth.

351
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,720
Anything you bring back will be useless

352
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,360
unless Cersei grants us an audience

353
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,950
and is somehow convinced not to murder us

354
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,520
the moment we set foot in the capital.

355
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,070
The only person she listens to is Jaime.

356
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,820
He might listen to me.

357
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,080
And how would you get into King's Landing?

358
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,430
I can smuggle you in,

359
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,350
but if the gold cloaks were to recognize you,

360
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,450
I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.

361
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,640
Well, it will all be for nothing

362
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,730
if we don't have one of these dead men.

363
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,030
Fair point.

364
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,050
How do you propose to find one?

365
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,070
With the queen's permission, I'll go north and take one.

366
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,880
You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.

367
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,900
Allow me to serve you.

368
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,590
The Free Folk will help us.

369
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,840
They know the real north better than anyone.

370
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,630
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

371
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,100
They won't have to.

372
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,820
You can't lead a raid beyond the Wall.

373
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,790
You're not in the Night's Watch anymore,

374
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,750
you're King in the North.

375
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,050
I'm the only one here who's fought them.

376
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,780
I'm the only one here who knows them.

377
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,060
I haven't given you permission to leave.

378
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,670
With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.

379
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,700
I am a king.

380
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,530
And I came here

381
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,200
knowing that you could have your men behead me

382
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,530
or your dragons burn me alive.

383
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,850
I put my trust in you, a stranger,

384
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,840
because I knew it was the best chance for my people,

385
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,100
for all our people.

386
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:52,250
Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger...

387
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,980
because it's our best chance.

388
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,720
The King in the North should stay in the North.

389
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,950
We did not choose you to rule us, my lady.

390
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,020
But perhaps we should have.

391
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,610
The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.

392
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,160
You are very kind, my lords.

393
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,960
But Jon is our king.

394
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,410
He is doing what he thinks is best.

395
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,580
I warned Jon this would happen.

396
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,240
That he couldn't leave the North

397
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,940
and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.

398
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,650
He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.

399
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,540
Well, he's not making it easy. The Northern lords are proud.

400
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,310
These are Mother and Father's chambers.

401
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,060
And?

402
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,900
Nothing.

403
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,100
Don't do that.

404
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,680
- What? - Say what you mean.

405
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,220
You always liked nice things.

406
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,650
They made you feel better than everyone.

407
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,300
Are you angry with me?

408
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,270
They were insulting Jon,

409
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,090
and you sat there and listened.

410
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,560
I listened to their complaints,

411
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,710
which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.

412
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,830
Their opinions are important to you.

413
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,050
Glover has 500 men, Royce has 2,000.

414
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,290
Offend them and Jon loses his army.

415
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,430
Not if they lose their heads first.

416
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,060
Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.

417
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,640
We took it back,

418
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,580
and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods

419
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,170
and the wildlings and the Vale.

420
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,660
All of us, working together.

421
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,090
Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying,

422
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,680
but that's not the way you get people to work together.

423
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,850
And if Jon doesn't come back,

424
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,860
you'll need their support...

425
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,790
so you can work together

426
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,040
to give you what you really want.

427
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,060
How can you even think such a horrible thing?

428
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,300
You're thinking it right now.

429
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,410
You don't want to be,

430
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,720
but the thought just won't go away.

431
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,460
I have work to do.

432
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,410
My lady.

433
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,010
Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.

434
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,060
Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire.

435
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:27,630
There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.

436
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,060
The guards hardly ever patrol it.

437
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,790
Too many steps.

438
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,090
You're not staying here?

439
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,100
I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.

440
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,080
What if someone takes the boat?

441
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,800
Then we're fucked. Best hurry.

442
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,590
We don't have time for this.

443
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,340
We should be preparing the city for a siege.

444
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,500
The Dothraki are coming.

445
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,430
All the more reason for you to train.

446
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,530
Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.

447
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,180
Well, I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.

448
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,120
And here I am, ready to train.

449
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,570
Why down here?

450
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,010
I don't think you want people to see

451
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,420
how you look swinging that thing yet.

452
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,820
Today might be the day I kill you by accident.

453
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,880
Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.

454
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,730
I'll leave you to it.

455
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,500
I needed to see you.

456
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,050
And I knew you'd never agree to meet.

457
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,470
You made me look like a complete fool.

458
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,040
I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock,

459
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,270
but you were three steps ahead of me.

460
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:49,420
Abandoned the family home, completely unsentimental.

461
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,540
Father would have been proud.

462
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,940
- Don't talk about Father. - Listen to me--

463
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,650
I once told Bronn

464
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,090
that if I ever saw you again, I'd cut you in half.

465
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,250
It'll take you a while with a sparring sword.

466
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,650
He was going to execute me.

467
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,970
He knew I was innocent.

468
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,220
He didn't hate me because of anything I did,

469
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,530
he hated me because of what I am.

470
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,470
A little monster sent to punish him.

471
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,090
Did he... did he think...

472
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,390
did he think I wanted to be born this way?

473
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,830
- Did he think I chose it? - What do you want?!

474
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,200
Daenerys will win this war.

475
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,680
You're a military man.

476
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,830
You must know there's no way around that.

477
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,290
Daenerys is not her father.

478
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,490
She's even willing to suspend the hostilities

479
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,000
if Cersei agrees to certain terms.

480
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,960
If you want Cersei to bend the knee,

481
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,900
you can ask her yourself.

482
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,770
I don't. And Daenerys doesn't.

483
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,590
Not right now, anyway.

484
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,090
She has a more important request.

485
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,460
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

486
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,920
Thought you might still be rowing.

487
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,460
I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.

488
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,040
Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.

489
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,750
Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?

490
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,230
Haven't been here in years.

491
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,250
Why should they recognize me?

492
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,490
Sometimes I hardly do.

493
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,100
Nothing fucks you harder than time.

494
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,030
Anybody give you any trouble?

495
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,050
Here I am, arming Lannisters,

496
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,160
and I never get a second look.

497
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,550
But you were right.

498
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,030
Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.

499
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,340
Don't be so sure.

500
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,610
Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.

501
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,370
Bad things are coming.

502
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,920
You came to get me. You want me to come with you.

503
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,660
- Well, the thing you need to understand is... - I'm ready.

504
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,970
- You... - Let's go.

505
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,240
You should know what you're heading into.

506
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,990
What do you think I've been thinking about

507
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,750
with every swing of the hammer?

508
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,090
How happy I am making weapons

509
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,040
for the family that killed my father?

510
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,470
The family that tried to kill me?

511
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,860
I've been getting ready.

512
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,970
I never knew what for,

513
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,460
but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.

514
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,710
You might want to bring one of those swords.

515
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,760
I don't know much about swinging swords.

516
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,920
But this

517
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,080
this I know.

518
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,280
Keep your father's name to yourself.

519
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,750
Situation's complicated enough already.

520
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,850
Well, who should I say I am?

521
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,840
I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon,

522
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,530
- someone's going to... - You there!

523
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,200
No weapons, friends. I promise.

524
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,800
What can I do for you?

525
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,530
- Is that your boat? - It is.

526
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,880
- The docks are that way. - That they are.

527
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,470
I try to stay away from them

528
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,850
to avoid good men such as yourselves.

529
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,550
- Still five gold dragons? - Are you joking?

530
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,960
You must be even older than you look.

531
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,840
- 15. - 15?!

532
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,050
Apiece.

533
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,940
I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.

534
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,670
What's in the boat?

535
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,480
Not more gold.

536
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,790
Wine?

537
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,430
- I like wine. - Or hams.

538
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,210
Come have a look.

539
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,530
- Fermented crab. - What?

540
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,230
Fermented crab.

541
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,480
One bucket of this triples a brothel's earnings for the week.

542
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,080
A man thinks he's done.

543
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,710
He's ready to go back to his loving family.

544
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,210
But before he gets his breeches up,

545
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:13,150
his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.

546
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,940
Five minutes later, he's back in the race.

547
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:19,350
Here, have a taste.

548
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,660
I'd hurry to your favorite establishment,

549
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,880
or you'll put a hole in that chainmail.

550
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,190
Oi, dwarf!

551
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,030
I really wouldn't try any more

552
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,820
until you see how the first bite hits you.

553
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,210
That dwarf...

554
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,600
Where'd you get that scar?

555
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,920
Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.

556
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,540
We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back.

557
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,700
Perhaps there's some arrangement?

558
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,170
Arrangement?

559
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,380
You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei...

560
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,780
This is Gendry.

561
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,440
He'll do.

562
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:43,610
Go, go, go.

563
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,790
I could give you something.

564
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,340
That won't be necessary.

565
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,110
Ser Jaime.

566
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,460
Why was Qyburn here?

567
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:07,810
He's the Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?

568
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,490
I met with Tyrion.

569
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,290
What did our brother have to say?

570
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,180
Daenerys wants to meet.

571
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,560
To discuss her surrender?

572
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,410
To discuss an armistice.

573
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,260
She's just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?

574
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,020
Because an army of dead men

575
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,210
is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.

576
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,210
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

577
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,090
- Are you going to punish him? - Tyrion?

578
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,160
Bronn.

579
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,530
He betrayed you.

580
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,260
He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.

581
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,870
Do you think anything of importance

582
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,160
happens in this city without me knowing?

583
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,850
You let it happen. Why?

584
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,210
I've come to believe that

585
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,600
an accommodation with the Dragon Queen

586
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,360
could be in our immediate interest.

587
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,720
She has the numbers.

588
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,780
If we want to beat her, we have to be clever.

589
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,070
We have to fight her like Father would have.

590
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:33,070
Dead men, dragons, and Dragon Queens...

591
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:39,530
Whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it.

592
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,410
For ourselves, for our house,

593
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,280
for this.

594
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Who will you say is the father?

595
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,760
You.

596
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,320
People won't like that.

597
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,290
Do you remember what father used to say about people?

598
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,010
The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

599
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,390
Never betray me again.

600
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,900
We're leaving today.

601
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,370
- The king's got a lot on his mind. - I understand.

602
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,000
He doesn't need to be thinking

603
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,190
about harboring the bastard of a dead king.

604
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,710
- You don't have to worry. - You're just Clovis,

605
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,100
a smith who's come to pay his respects

606
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,050
before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.

607
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:57,070
Understood.

608
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,890
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

609
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,100
You survived King's Landing.

610
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,040
Yet again. Your Grace, this is Clo-

611
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,780
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

612
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,120
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

613
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,360
Bastard son.

614
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,360
He was meant to keep that to himself.

615
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,200
Our fathers trusted each other.

616
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,460
Why shouldn't we?

617
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,550
I saw your father once at Winterfell.

618
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,530
I met yours in my shop.

619
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,460
- You're a lot leaner. - And you're a lot shorter.

620
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,530
I grew up on stories about them.

621
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,940
All I ever knew is that they fought together and won.

622
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,350
Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.

623
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,840
Let me come with you.

624
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,720
Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.

625
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,290
No, but I'm a fighter.

626
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,570
And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.

627
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,670
You know how to use one?

628
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,810
Well, that's a problem.

629
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,420
I prefer a hammer.

630
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,080
He can handle himself.

631
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,680
We could use the help.

632
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,910
As my father used to say,

633
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,090
"It's better to be a coward for a minute,

634
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,280
than dead for the rest of your life."

635
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,910
I owe you my life.

636
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,300
Twice over.

637
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,450
But if what you said is true about what's up there,

638
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,010
I can't wait out this war.

639
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,830
Yeah, nobody mind me.

640
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,200
All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.

641
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,450
All right, come on.

642
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,120
You may not believe it,

643
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,650
but I've missed you, Mormont.

644
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,840
Nobody glowers quite like you.

645
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,070
Not even Grey Worm.

646
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,850
This is the coin the slaver gave me

647
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,720
when I suggested he free us and pay us, remember?

648
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,080
It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.

649
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,920
Take it with you.

650
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,280
But bring it back.

651
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,080
Our queen needs you.

652
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,550
We should be better at saying farewell by now.

653
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,920
Your Grace, I...

654
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,360
If I don't return, at least you won't have to deal

655
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,200
with the King in the North anymore.

656
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,440
I've grown used to him.

657
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,220
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.

658
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,230
Heave.

659
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,950
Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?

660
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,980
No.

661
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,670
15,782.

662
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,220
Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.

663
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,710
None anymore.

664
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,230
That's true.

665
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,720
This High Septon Maynard, he recorded everything.

666
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,010
He even recorded his own bowel movements.

667
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,120
What does "Annulment" Mean?

668
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,800
It's when a man sets aside his lawful wife.

669
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,750
Maynard says here that

670
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,410
he issued an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

671
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,630
and remarried him to someone else at the same time

672
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,220
in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

673
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,000
Is that a common thing in the south or--?

674
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,630
These maesters...

675
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,900
they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting

676
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,600
and annulments and bowel movements for all eternity,

677
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,840
while the secret to defeating the Night King's

678
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,480
probably sitting on some

679
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,780
dusty shelf somewhere, completely ignored.

680
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,560
But that's all right, isn't it?

681
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,370
We can all become slavering,

682
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,600
murderous imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

683
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,140
as long as we can have access to the full records

684
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,150
of High Septon Maynard's 15,782 shits!

685
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,140
Steps.

686
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,880
That number was the steps.

687
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,590
Are you sure you want to do this?

688
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,450
You always wanted to be a maester.

689
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:50,020
I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.

690
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,110
I found it, my lord.

691
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,630
It, uh, took some searching.

692
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,740
Maester Luwin's archives are very thorough.

693
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,660
You're sure this is the only copy in Winterfell?

694
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,680
Uh, yes, my lord.

695
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:45,060
Lady Stark thanks you for your service.

697
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,390
Isn't it your job to talk him out

698
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:20,700
of stupid fucking ideas like this?

699
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,880
I've been failing at that job of late.

700
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,550
How many queens are there now?

701
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,140
Two.

702
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,440
And you need to convince the one with the dragons

703
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,320
or the one who fucks her brother?

704
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,200
Both.

705
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,070
How many men did you bring?

706
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,690
Not enough.

707
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,490
The big woman?

708
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,770
We were hoping some of your men could help.

709
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,380
I'll be staying behind.

710
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,570
I'm a liability out there, as you well know.

711
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,470
You are.

712
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,770
You really want to go out there? Again?

713
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,510
You're not the only ones.

714
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,280
My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.

715
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,870
Said they were on their way here.

716
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,700
You're the Hound.

717
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,050
I saw you once at Winterfell.

718
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,770
They want to go beyond the Wall, too.

719
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,110
We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.

720
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:45,950
Our Lord told us that the Great War is coming--

721
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,400
Don't trust him.

722
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,580
Don't trust any of them.

723
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,140
They're the Brotherhood.

724
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,920
And the last thing their lord told them to do

725
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,690
was sell me to a red witch to be murdered.

726
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,090
Thoros?

727
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,770
I hardly recognized you.

728
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:13,340
Ser Jorah Mormont.

729
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,330
They won't give me anything to drink down here.

730
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,780
I haven't been feeling like myself.

731
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,550
You're a fucking Mormont?

732
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,520
Like the last Lord Commander?

733
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,830
He was my father.

734
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,850
He hunted us like animals.

735
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,480
You returned the favor, as I recall.

736
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,160
Here we all are

737
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,660
at the edge of the world

738
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,260
at the same moment,

739
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,990
heading in the same direction for the same reason.

740
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,720
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

741
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,160
It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.

742
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,400
There's a greater purpose at work.

743
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,810
And we serve it together,

744
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,370
whether we know it or not.

745
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,510
We may take the steps, but the Lord of Light--

746
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,470
For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole?

747
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,860
Are we coming with you or not?

748
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,530
Don't you want to know what we're doing?

749
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,690
Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell, waiting to die?

750
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,320
He's right.

751
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,510
We're all on the same side.

752
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,360
How can we be?

753
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,150
We're all breathing.

754
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,190
Death is the enemy.

755
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,510
The first enemy and the last.

756
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:13,650
The enemy always wins.

757
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,960
And we still need to fight him.

758
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,240
You're scared, aren't you?

759
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,210
What are you scared of?
