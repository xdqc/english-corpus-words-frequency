2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,550
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,120
Myrcella?

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,370
Myrcella?

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,760
Kill us!

6
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,060
I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,830
Please try not to scream.

8
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,220
This is Brandon Stark,

9
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,290
Son of Ned Stark.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,030
Let's get them inside.

11
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,780
For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros,

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,740
and the feat of that power is Casterly Rock.

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,040
Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock, and take it.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,540
Summon Jon Snow.

15
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,650
He would make a valuable ally.

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,070
Let him stand before you and tell you the things that have happened to him.

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,780
Dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,300
We can never hope to defeat the army of the dead alone.

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,640
We need allies.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,300
You're abandoning your people! You're abandoning your home.

21
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,090
Until I return, the North is yours.

22
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,460
The bastard of Winterfell.

23
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,670
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

24
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,970
I believe we last saw each other atop the Wall.

25
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,270
You were pissing off the edge if I remember right.

26
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,700
Picked up some scars along the road.

27
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,140
It's been a long road, but we're both still here.

28
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,770
I'm Tyrion Lannister.

29
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,280
- Davos Seaworth. - Ah, the Onion Knight.

30
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,290
We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

31
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,910
Unluckily for me.

32
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,620
Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.

33
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,410
Welcome to Dragonstone.

34
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,200
Our queen knows it is a long journey.

35
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,000
She appreciates the efforts you have made on her behalf.

36
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,660
If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.

37
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,900
Of course.

38
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,730
Please, this way.

39
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,140
Where are you from?

40
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,600
I can't place the accent.

41
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,990
I was born on the Island of Naath.

42
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,700
I hear it's beautiful down there.

43
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,100
Palm trees and butterflies.

44
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,310
Haven't been, myself.

45
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,340
This place has changed.

46
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
And Sansa? I hear she's alive and well.

47
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,680
- She is. - Does she miss me terribly?

48
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,170
A sham marriage. And unconsummated.

49
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,170
- I didn't ask. - Well, it was. Wasn't.

50
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,040
Anyway...

51
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,110
she's much smarter than she lets on.

52
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,610
She's starting to let on.

53
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,050
Good.

54
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,470
At some point,

55
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,430
I want to hear how a Night's watch recruit became King in the North.

56
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,050
As long as you tell me how a Lannister

57
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,520
became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

58
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,790
A long and bloody tale.

59
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,720
To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.

60
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,840
My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.

61
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,940
Of course they do.

62
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,930
If I was your Hand, I would have advised against it.

63
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,060
General rule of thumb--

64
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,380
Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.

65
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,430
True...

66
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,100
but I'm not a Stark.

67
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,570
I'd say you get used to them...

68
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,100
but you never really do.

69
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,640
Come, their mother is waiting for you.

70
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,320
I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.

71
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,330
You begged us to summon the King in the North.

72
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't you want to see him again?

73
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,450
I've done my part.

74
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,680
I've brought ice and fire together.

75
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,380
Strange.

76
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,320
You spoke so highly of Jon Snow,

77
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,350
but when he arrives, you hide on a cliff.

78
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,650
I didn't take you for a bashful girl.

79
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,620
My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.

80
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,060
Oh, I doubt that.

81
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,660
Give us common folk one taste of power,

82
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,130
we're like the lion who tasted man.

83
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,760
Nothing is ever so sweet again.

84
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,520
Neither of us is common folk anymore.

85
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,940
I did not part on good terms

86
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,790
with the King in the North or his advisor.

87
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,830
Why?

88
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,430
Because of mistakes I made.

89
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
Terrible mistakes.

90
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,090
I would only be a distraction if I stayed.

91
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,920
- So, where will you go? - Volantis.

92
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,730
Good.

93
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,690
If you don't mind my saying,

94
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,310
I don't think you should return to Westeros.

95
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,990
I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

96
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,930
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.

97
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,250
- One last time. - My lady--

98
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,560
I have to die in this strange country.

99
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,820
Just like you.

100
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,390
You stand in the presence

101
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,210
of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen,

102
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,420
rightful heir to the Iron Throne,

103
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,230
rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

104
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,530
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,

105
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,380
the Mother of Dragons,

106
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,750
the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea,

107
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,300
the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.

108
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,020
This is Jon Snow.

109
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,640
He's King in the North.

110
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,180
Thank you for traveling so far, my lord.

111
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,300
I hope the seas weren't too rough.

112
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,730
The winds were kind, Your Grace.

113
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,540
Apologies, I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know,

114
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,640
but Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.

115
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,510
- He's not a lord. - Forgive me--

116
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,030
Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

117
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,860
Forgive me, Ser Davos.

118
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,240
I never did receive a formal education,

119
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,460
but I could have sworn I read

120
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,970
the last King in the North was Torrhen Stark,

121
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,000
who bent the knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.

122
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,430
In exchange for his life and the lives of the Northmen,

123
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,950
Torrhen Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.

124
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,020
Or do I have my facts wrong?

125
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,170
I wasn't there, Your Grace.

126
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,360
No, of course not.

127
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,260
But still, an oath is an oath.

128
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,300
And perpetuity means--

129
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,940
what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?

130
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,230
Forever.

131
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,330
Forever.

132
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,550
So I assume, my lord...

133
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,410
...you're here to bend the knee.

134
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,350
I am not.

135
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,580
Well, that is unfortunate.

136
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,710
You've traveled all this way

137
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,830
to break faith with House Targaryen?

138
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,950
Break faith?

139
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,650
Your father burned my grandfather alive.

140
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,280
He burned my uncle alive.

141
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,720
He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms--

142
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,080
My father... was an evil man.

143
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,750
On behalf of House Targaryen...

144
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
I ask your forgiveness

145
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,410
for the crimes he committed against your family.

146
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,530
And I ask you not to judge a daughter

147
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,360
by the sins of her father.

148
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,940
Our two houses were allies for centuries,

149
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,770
and those were the best centuries

150
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,780
the Seven Kingdoms have ever known.

151
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,320
Centuries of peace and prosperity

152
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,180
with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne

153
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,650
and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.

154
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,960
I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.

155
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,830
Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.

156
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,120
Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.

157
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,090
Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.

158
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,700
You're right.

159
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,520
You're not guilty of your father's crimes.

160
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,760
And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.

161
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,640
Then why are you here?

162
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,570
Because I need your help, and you need mine.

163
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,240
Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?

164
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,200
I did.

165
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,230
And did you see the Dothraki,

166
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,010
all of whom have sworn to kill for me?

167
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,390
They're hard to miss.

168
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,250
But still, I need your help?

169
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,890
Not to defeat Cersei.

170
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,980
You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.

171
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,750
Hell, we almost took it

172
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,740
and we didn't even have dragons.

173
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,900
- Almost. - But you haven't stormed King's Landing.

174
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,450
Why not?

175
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,840
The only reason I can see

176
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,440
is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.

177
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,980
It's the fastest way to win the war,

178
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,470
but you won't do it,

179
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,860
which means, at the very least,

180
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,700
you're better than Cersei.

181
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,860
Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.

182
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,410
Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else,

183
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,570
we're children playing at a game,

184
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,650
screaming that the rules aren't fair.

185
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,830
- You told me you liked this man. - I do.

186
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,320
In the time since he's met me, he's refused to call me queen,

187
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,220
he's refused to bow, and now he's calling me a child.

188
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,310
I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.

189
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,300
Your Grace, everyone you know will die before winter's over

190
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,470
if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.

191
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,950
As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.

192
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,400
I am not your enemy.

193
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,190
The dead are the enemy.

194
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,670
The dead?

195
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,430
Is that another figure of speech?

196
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,090
The Army of the Dead is on the march.

197
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,850
The Army of the Dead?

198
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,460
You don't know me well, my lord,

199
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,750
but do you think I'm a liar or a madman?

200
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,220
No, I don't think you're either of those things.

201
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,230
The Army of the Dead is real.

202
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,830
The white walkers are real.

203
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,270
The Night King is real. I've seen them.

204
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,270
If they get past the Wall

205
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,000
and we're squabbling amongst ourselves...

206
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,810
we're finished.

207
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,110
I was born at Dragonstone.

208
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,600
Not that I can remember it.

209
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.

210
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,100
Robert was your father's best friend, no?

211
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,200
I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins

212
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,630
to murder a baby girl in her crib.

213
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,180
Not that it matters now, of course.

214
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,460
I spent my life in foreign lands.

215
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,320
So many men have tried to kill me,

216
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,490
I don't remember all their names.

217
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,600
I have been sold like a broodmare.

218
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,240
I've been chained and betrayed,

219
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,610
raped and defiled.

220
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,820
Do you know what kept me standing

221
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,770
through all those years in exile?

222
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,320
Faith.

223
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,300
Not in any gods,

224
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,910
not in myths and legends.

225
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,160
In myself.

226
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,620
In Daenerys Targaryen.

227
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,740
The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries

228
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,650
until my children were born.

229
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,060
The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea, any sea.

230
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,700
They did for me.

231
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,520
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms,

232
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,120
and I will.

233
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,340
You'll be ruling over a graveyard

234
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,950
if we don't defeat the Night King.

235
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,790
The war against my sister has already begun.

236
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,340
You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting

237
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,590
whatever you saw beyond the Wall.

238
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,370
You don't believe him.

239
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,310
I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.

240
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,940
But if destiny has brought

241
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,410
Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores,

242
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,510
it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.

243
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,460
You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros?

244
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,270
He is the first to make allies of wildlings and Northmen.

245
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,280
He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

246
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,560
He was named King in the North.

247
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,660
Not because of his birthright.

248
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,220
He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard.

249
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,950
All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader

250
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,130
because they believe in him.

251
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,190
All those things you don't believe in,

252
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,880
he faced those things.

253
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,270
He fought those things for the good of his people.

254
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,630
He risked his life for his people.

255
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,320
He took a knife in the heart for his people.

256
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,540
He gave his own--

257
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,940
If we don't put aside our enmities and band together,

258
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,010
we will die.

259
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,850
And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

260
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,350
If it doesn't matter, then you might as well kneel.

261
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,340
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys,

262
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,000
help her to defeat my sister,

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,660
and together, our armies will protect the North.

264
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,320
There's no time for that.

265
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,760
There's no time for any of this!

266
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,340
While we stand here, debating--

267
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,450
It takes no time to bend the knee.

268
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,990
Pledge your sword to her cause.

269
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,360
And why would I do that?

270
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,020
I mean no offense, Your Grace,

271
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,330
but I don't know you.

272
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,040
As far as I can tell,

273
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,190
your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name,

274
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,370
and my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.

275
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,860
The lords of the North

276
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,960
placed their trust in me to lead them,

277
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,910
and I will continue to do so as well as I can.

278
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,430
That's fair.

279
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,290
It's also fair to point out

280
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,590
that I'm the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

281
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,870
By declaring yourself king of the northernmost kingdom,

282
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,120
you are in open rebellion.

283
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,420
Your Grace, please dismiss your guests.

284
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,880
I have grave news.

285
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,470
You must forgive my manners.

286
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,050
You'll both be tired after your long journey.

287
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,010
We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.

289
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,580
Am I your prisoner?

290
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,910
Not yet.

291
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,190
Our ironborn and Dornish allies

292
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,010
were attacked en route to Dorne.

293
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,210
- And? - Two or three ships escaped,

294
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,360
the rest, sunk or captured.

295
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,070
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, dead or captured.

296
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,470
The Greyjoys, dead or captured.

297
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,210
All of them?

298
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,220
- Pull! - Heave!

299
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,480
Pull!

300
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,410
Your sister's dead?

301
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,210
Euron has her.

302
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,780
You saw him take her?

303
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,640
- But you got away? - I couldn't save her.

304
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,080
I tried.

305
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,930
You wouldn't be here if you tried.

306
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,680
Come, men!

307
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,070
Sails up!

308
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,710
Murderer!

309
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,530
Whores!

310
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,130
Traitor!

311
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,670
This is the life.

312
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,740
Look at them, cheering for a Greyjoy.

313
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,060
I have to be honest,

314
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,400
this is making me hard.

315
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,010
Did you see Little Theon's face

316
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,800
right before he jumped overboard?

317
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,190
"Oh, no!"

318
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,230
What a twat.

319
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,580
- Whore! Whore! Whore! - Murderers!

320
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,770
My queen, please accept this gift

321
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,840
on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.

322
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,040
I give you what no other man could give--

323
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,510
justice.

324
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,360
Justice for your murdered daughter.

325
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,130
You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the fourteen seas

326
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,270
and a true friend to the crown.

327
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,070
You deserve more than a true friend.

328
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,530
And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.

329
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,870
There's only one reward I want.

330
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,030
You shall have what your heart desires...

331
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,410
when the war is won.

332
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,810
With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces

333
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,380
and Jaime Lannister leading our armies,

334
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,710
the sons and daughters of Westeros

335
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,380
shall defend our country.

336
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,700
There's nothing quite like it, is there?

337
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,660
The love of the people.

338
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,750
Though I suppose you wouldn't know.

339
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,610
This same mob spat at my sister not long ago.

340
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,250
And if you turn on us,

341
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,530
they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.

342
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,680
Or yours.

343
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,170
They just like severed heads, really.

344
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,220
Listen, if you have any advice at all,

345
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,750
I would love to hear it.

346
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,200
When we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.

347
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,270
Advice?

348
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,890
Does she like it gentle or rough?

349
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,300
A finger in the bum?

350
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,320
Not now. We'll talk later.

351
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,300
I want you to know I understand.

352
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,570
Even though we're enemies, you and I,

353
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,720
I understand the fury that drives you.

354
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,060
I was there that day when Ser Gregor

355
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,140
crushed your lover's head.

356
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,910
If I close my eyes,

357
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,470
I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.

358
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,050
The sound of your scream.

359
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,280
I never heard a sound like that.

360
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,300
I thought, "That's true love."

361
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,220
Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did.

362
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,290
No one moved like him.

363
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,570
No one had such skill with a spear.

364
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,440
Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.

365
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,070
If only he hadn't taunted him.

366
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,590
He could've walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.

367
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,770
But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?

368
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,400
Now he's buried somewhere.

369
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
And here's Ser Gregor, stronger than ever.

370
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,400
That must be difficult for you.

371
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,370
When my daughter was taken from me,

372
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,020
my only daughter...

373
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,370
well, you can't imagine how that feels

374
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:52,160
unless you've lost a child.

375
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,280
I fed her at my own breast even though they told me

376
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,000
to give her to the wet nurse.

377
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,600
I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.

378
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,320
I never got to have a mother,

379
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,240
but Myrcella did.

380
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,030
She was mine, and you took her from me.

381
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,400
Why did you do that?

382
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,730
Doesn't matter now.

383
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,060
Your daughter's a beauty, too.

384
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,840
Those brown eyes.

385
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,180
Those lips.

386
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,000
Perfect Dornish beauty.

387
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,550
I imagine she's your favorite.

388
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,290
I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites,

389
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,170
but still, we're only human.

390
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,400
We love whom we love.

391
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm sorry, I can't understand you.

392
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,810
That gag makes it impossible to understand what you're saying.

393
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,230
It must be frustrating.

394
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,410
We all make our choices.

395
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,550
You chose to murder my daughter.

396
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,930
You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.

397
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,770
Do you feel powerful now?

398
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,690
I don't sleep very well.

399
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,990
Not at all, really.

400
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,950
I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy

401
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,320
and imagine ways of killing my enemies.

402
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,060
How to destroy Ellaria Sand,

403
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,390
the woman who murdered my only daughter.

404
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,790
I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull

405
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,250
the way he did Oberyn's.

406
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,770
It would be poetic, I suppose, but fast, too fast.

407
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,870
I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.

408
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,870
She's so beautiful.

409
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,050
The thought of this lovely face

410
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,950
cracking open like a duck egg,

411
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,980
no, it's just not right.

412
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,540
Mama.

413
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,200
Qyburn here is the cleverest man I know.

414
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,810
Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.

415
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,100
The Long Goodbye, was that it?

416
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,650
- The Long Farewell. - That's the one.

417
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,380
How long does the poison take?

418
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,630
Difficult to say-- hours, days.

419
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,730
It depends on the subject's constitution.

420
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,040
But death is certain?

421
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,190
Oh, yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

422
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,630
Your daughter will die here in this cell,

423
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,620
and you will be here watching when she does.

424
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,350
You'll be here the rest of your days.

425
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,100
If you refuse to eat, we'll force food down your throat.

426
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,070
You will live to watch your daughter rot.

427
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,950
To watch that beautiful face collapse...

428
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,950
...to bone and dust.

429
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,180
All the while contemplating the choices you've made.

430
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,220
Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.

431
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,880
I don't want her to miss a thing.

432
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,390
No.

433
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,220
Don't.

434
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,170
What are you doing? No one can see us like this.

435
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,320
I am the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.

436
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,630
Forgive me, Your Grace.

437
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,630
The visitor from Braavos has arrived.

438
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,560
Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.

439
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,780
At once, Your Grace.

440
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,930
No, thank you.

441
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,140
My condolences, Your Grace,

442
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,070
on the death of your son.

443
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,940
From all reports, he was a fine young man.

444
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,720
The Iron Bank didn't send you here to offer condolences.

445
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,850
Condolences and congratulations.

446
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,870
To become the first ruling Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,

447
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,730
that's quite an accomplishment.

448
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,110
The Iron Bank appreciates

449
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,850
how you cast off the yoke of superstition,

450
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,230
freeing the crown from elements

451
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,860
who sought to subvert the rule of law.

452
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,110
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.

453
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,290
Indeed, but sometimes tragedies are necessary

454
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,570
to restore order and rational leadership.

455
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,450
The Iron Bank wants its gold back.

456
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,740
Your father never minced words either.

457
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,670
But, yes, your debts are considerable.

458
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,660
And you're now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.

459
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,500
We both know how expensive war can be.

460
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,770
And we both know gold wins wars.

461
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,250
Your vaults are empty.

462
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,010
Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.

463
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,980
Your wealthiest allies, the Tyrells, are now your enemies.

464
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,590
You are surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.

465
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,580
And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.

466
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,080
We don't make bets.

467
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,700
We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.

468
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,790
A fancy way of saying "Bet."

469
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,710
The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.

470
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,830
I decapitated the Dornish snake.

471
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,500
My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

472
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,880
Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.

473
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,430
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

474
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,670
For now.

475
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,700
Daenerys Targaryen has three full-grown dragons.

476
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:54,130
How well do wooden ships fare against fire-breathing dragons?

477
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,840
Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.

478
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,270
But let's talk about the Targaryen girl.

479
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,290
You want to invest in her?

480
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,950
I'm guessing the Iron Bank

481
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,410
invested considerable gold in the slave trade.

482
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,840
How are your profits

483
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,080
now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?

484
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,240
The slave trade has entered a downturn, it's true.

485
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,400
From what I gather, she considers herself

486
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,830
more of a revolutionary than a monarch.

487
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,330
In your experience,

488
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,020
how do bankers usually fare with revolutionaries?

489
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,420
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money,

490
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,710
but Lannisters always pay their debts.

491
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,640
Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?

492
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,750
Your father's daughter, indeed.

493
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,110
Give me a fortnight.

494
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,460
Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest.

495
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,700
And when you return to Braavos,

496
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,920
I swear to you, my debt will be paid in full.

497
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,830
I came down here to brood over my failure

498
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,570
to predict the Greyjoy attack.

499
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:21,890
You're making it difficult.

500
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,840
You look a lot better brooding than I do.

501
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,600
You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.

502
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,460
I'm a prisoner on this island.

503
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,740
I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.

504
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,100
You're free to walk the castle,

505
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,670
the beaches, to go wherever you want.

506
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,970
Except to my ship.

507
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,310
You took my ship.

508
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,330
I wouldn't say we took your ship.

509
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,220
I'm not playing word games with you.

510
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,760
The dead are coming for us all.

511
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,010
Why don't you figure out what to do

512
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,490
about my missing fleet and murdered allies,

513
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,250
and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.

514
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,710
It's hard for me to fathom. It really is.

515
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,750
If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King...

516
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,450
You probably don't believe me.

517
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,100
I do, actually.

518
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,990
You didn't before.

519
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,180
"Grumkins and snarks," You called them.

520
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,170
Do you remember?

521
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,210
You said it was all nonsense.

522
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,210
It was nonsense. Everybody knew it.

523
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,340
But then Mormont saw them

524
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,800
and you saw them.

525
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,840
And I trust the eyes of an honest man

526
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,720
more than I trust what everybody knows.

527
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,280
How do I convince people who don't know me

528
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,400
that an enemy they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?

529
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,500
- Good question. - I know it's a good question.

530
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,950
I'm looking for an answer.

531
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,920
People's minds aren't made for problems that large.

532
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,080
White walkers, the Night King,

533
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,880
Army of the Dead--

534
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,120
it's almost a relief to confront

535
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,860
a comfortable, familiar monster like my sister.

536
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,090
I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.

537
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,910
I can't help them from here.

538
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,340
I'd like to leave.

539
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,920
It seems unlikely that you became King in the North

540
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,420
by giving up that easily.

541
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,880
Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.

542
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,120
Don't go south.

543
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,420
Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter,

544
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,790
a foreign invader.

545
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,350
And here I am,

546
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,460
a Northern fool.

547
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,310
Children are not their fathers,

548
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,420
luckily for all of us.

549
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,390
And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders

550
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,760
and Northern fools than meets the eye.

551
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,680
Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago,

552
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,700
but she didn't.

553
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,560
Instead, she stayed where she was

554
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,150
and saved many people from horrible fates,

555
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,850
some of whom are on this island with us right now.

556
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,370
While you're our guest here,

557
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,620
you might consider asking them

558
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,820
what they think of the Mad King's daughter.

559
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,110
She protects people from monsters,

560
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,810
just as you do.

561
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,380
It's why she came here.

562
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,060
And she's not about to head north

563
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,580
to fight an enemy she's never seen

564
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,620
on the word of a man she doesn't know.

565
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,400
After a single meeting,

566
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,500
it's not a reasonable thing to ask.

567
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,930
So, do you have anything reasonable to ask?

568
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,480
What do you mean?

569
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,470
Maybe you are a Northern fool.

570
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,500
I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.

571
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,330
- Dragonglass? - Yes.

572
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,860
Volcanic glass, obsidian.

573
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,770
He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.

574
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,460
Why are we talking about glass?

575
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,660
We just lost two of our allies.

576
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,350
Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

577
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,050
And what does the King in the North want with dragonglass?

578
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,400
Apparently, it can be turned into weapons

579
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,130
that kill white walkers and their foot soldiers.

580
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,880
Or stop them.

581
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,590
Destroy them.

582
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,870
Unsure about the nomenclature.

583
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,520
And what do you think about this Army of the Dead

584
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,390
and white walkers and Night Kings?

585
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,330
I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong.

586
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,250
But a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing

587
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,420
simply because you want to believe it.

588
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,070
Which wise man said this?

589
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,960
I don't remember.

590
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,750
Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?

591
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,700
I would never do that.

592
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,470
To you.

593
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:50,520
The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.

594
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,270
All of his advisors would have told him not to come.

595
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,080
I would have told him not to come.

596
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,720
And he's here anyway.

597
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,390
You don't have to believe him.

598
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,000
Let him mine the dragonglass.

599
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,840
If he's wrong, it's worthless.

600
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,530
You didn't even know it was here.

601
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,000
It's nothing to you.

602
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,480
Give him something by giving him nothing.

603
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,200
Take a step toward a more productive relationship

604
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,640
with a possible ally.

605
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,810
Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand

606
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,660
Casterly Rock.

607
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,730
What was that Ser Davos said

608
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,510
about taking a knife in the heart for his people?

609
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,970
Did you notice that?

610
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,750
You must allow them their flights of fancy.

611
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,720
It's dreary in the North.

612
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,330
Amazing thing to see.

613
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,020
I named them for my brothers, Viserys and Rhaegar.

614
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,560
They're both gone now.

615
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,640
You lost two brothers as well.

616
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,640
People thought dragons were gone forever, but here they are.

617
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,190
Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.

618
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,510
You've been talking to Tyrion.

619
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,530
He is my Hand.

620
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,090
- He enjoys talking. - We all enjoy what we're good at.

621
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,240
I don't.

622
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,570
You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

623
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,830
I never expected that you would.

624
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,750
And I haven't changed my mind

625
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,160
about which kingdoms belong to that throne.

626
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,280
I haven't either.

627
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,710
I will allow you to mine

628
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,180
the dragonglass and forge weapons from it.

629
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,300
Any resources or men you need, I will provide for you.

630
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,650
Thank you.

631
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,770
So you believe me, then,

632
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,050
about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?

633
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,370
You'd better get to work, Jon Snow.

634
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,240
How much do we have?

635
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,380
4,000 bushels, my lady.

636
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,460
What does that mean?

637
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,570
For the current occupants of the castle,

638
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,610
it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.

639
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,390
And what's the longest winter in the past hundred years?

640
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,250
Uh, I'm not entirely certain.

641
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,480
I'll check Maester Luwin's records.

642
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,760
He kept a copy of every raven scroll.

643
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,820
You're telling me we don't have enough food,

644
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,020
especially not if the armies

645
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,520
of the North come back to defend Winterfell?

646
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,430
No, my lady, most likely not.

647
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,580
Then we must prepare for that eventuality.

648
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,400
Whatever direction the threat comes from,

649
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,140
this is the best place to be.

650
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,810
We need to start building up our grain stores

651
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,560
with regular shipments from every keep in the North.

652
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,650
If we don't use it by winter's end, we'll give it back to them.

653
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,020
But if the entire North has to flee to Winterfell,

654
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,800
they won't have enough time to bring

655
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,750
wagonloads of grain with them.

656
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,260
Very wise, my lady.

657
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,900
Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?

658
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,950
Are they covering those breastplates in leather?

659
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,790
No, my lady.

660
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,730
Well, shouldn't they be? Once the real cold comes?

661
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,020
They should, indeed.

662
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,480
Pardon me, my lady.

663
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,630
You there, why isn't there leather on these?

664
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,390
Command suits you.

665
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,650
The Northerners are all facing north,

666
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,560
worried about the threat from beyond the Wall.

667
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:07,840
So they should be.

668
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,560
I know Cersei better than anyone here.

669
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:12,810
If you turn your back on her…

670
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,280
You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.

671
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,910
I only meant to say…

672
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,250
That the woman who murdered my mother,

673
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,340
father, and brother is dangerous?

674
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,110
Thank you for your wise counsel.

675
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,340
One of two things will happen,

676
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,990
either the dead will defeat the living,

677
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,170
in which case...

678
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,900
all our troubles come to an end,

679
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,420
or life will win out.

680
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,420
And what then?

681
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,690
Don't fight in the North or the South.

682
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,900
Fight every battle, everywhere, always, in your mind.

683
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,420
Everyone is your enemy,

684
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,420
everyone is your friend,

685
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:58,370
every possible series of events is happening all at once.

686
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,370
Live that way and nothing will surprise you.

687
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,880
Everything that happens will be something

688
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,580
that you've seen before.

689
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,760
Lady Sansa, at the gate.

690
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,940
Hello, Sansa.

691
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,980
I wish Jon were here.

692
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,840
Yes, I need to speak to him.

693
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,720
You're Father's last living trueborn son.

694
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,420
You're Lord of Winterfell now.

695
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,270
I can never be Lord of Winterfell.

696
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,200
I can never be lord of anything.

697
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,620
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

698
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,240
I don't know what that means.

699
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,670
It's difficult to explain.

700
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,790
Try. Please, for me.

701
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,090
It means I can see everything.

702
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,100
Everything that's ever happened to everyone.

703
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,260
Everything that's happening right now.

704
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,570
It's all pieces now, fragments.

705
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,500
I need to learn to see better.

706
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,980
When the Long Night comes again,

707
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,430
I need to be ready.

708
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,500
How do you know all this?

709
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,030
The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.

710
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,150
I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.

711
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,560
I told you it's difficult to explain.

712
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,290
Bran--

713
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,040
I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.

714
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,500
I'm sorry it had to happen here in our home.

715
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,780
It was so beautiful that night.

716
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,960
Snow falling, just like now.

717
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,050
And you were so beautiful...

718
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,810
in your white wedding dress.

719
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,500
I have to go back inside, Bran.

720
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,140
I'll stay a bit longer.

721
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,760
Does it hurt?

722
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,400
A bit. Less than before.

723
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,920
The infection no longer appears to be active.

724
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,330
Unusual.

725
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,130
Unlikely.

726
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,300
One could almost be forgiven

727
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:39,760
for thinking that the entire

728
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,820
upper layer of diseased skin was debrided

729
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,660
and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.

730
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:48,840
Don't know anything about that.

731
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,970
I just started feeling better.

732
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,980
I assumed it was the rest that did it.

733
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,760
And the climate.

734
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,310
The climate.

735
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:03,770
You're free to go, ser.

736
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,140
This chamber is needed for the infectious,

737
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,530
which you are no longer.

738
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,030
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.

739
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:15,230
How bad is it?

740
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,870
Suppose I'll find out this evening.

741
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,630
Where will you go?

742
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,800
I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.

743
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,930
I knew it would kill me

744
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,370
or I'd kill myself before it could.

745
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,940
Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.

746
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,380
The only place for me is back with her.

747
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,260
I owe her my life.

748
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,750
Her and you.

749
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,160
Your father saved me more than once.

750
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,850
It's the least I could do.

751
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,900
Perhaps our paths will cross again.

752
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,990
I hope they do.

753
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,770
- You treated him? - Yes.

754
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,540
Who told you to treat him?

755
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:35,840
No one.

756
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,360
Who forbade you, or anyone, to attempt to treat him?

757
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,850
I seem to remember you.

758
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,650
- But you treated him anyway? - I did, yes.

759
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,660
I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful,

760
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,650
especially on someone of that age.

761
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,330
You could have infected yourself and others.

762
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,500
You could have devastated the entire Citadel.

763
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,910
But you didn't.

764
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:04,670
It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.

765
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,520
Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links

766
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,520
have attempted it and failed.

767
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,570
Yet you succeeded.

768
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,660
How?

769
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,540
I read the books and followed the instructions.

770
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,140
That man is alive because of you.

771
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,080
You should be proud.

772
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,150
Thank you, Archmaester.

773
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,830
Come here.

774
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,180
All these manuscripts and scrolls are rotting away.

775
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,140
I need you to make copies of them.

776
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:58,300
You were expecting a reward.

777
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:04,370
Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.

778
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,740
You'd better get started.

779
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,840
And careful of the paper mites.

780
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,410
They like flesh as well.

781
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:20,920
We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

782
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,400
Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.

783
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,740
To send our remaining ships after him--

784
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,580
I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.

785
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,940
Would you have to go yourself?

786
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,700
Euron's ships could be anywhere

787
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:37,520
or in more than one place.

788
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:40,140
You'd be flying around the open seas alone

789
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,200
for who knows how long.

790
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,390
I wouldn't be alone.

791
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,890
I would have Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal.

792
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,200
What can anyone do to them?

793
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,100
They can still do something to you.

794
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,920
It only takes one arrow.

795
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,400
It's too great a risk. You're too important.

796
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,610
What about Casterly Rock?

797
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,810
The Unsullied will be there soon.

798
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,480
And what will they face?

799
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,260
A difficult situation.

800
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,180
They know we're coming.

801
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,360
Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life

802
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,170
is to destroy House Lannister.

804
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,010
She will be ready.

805
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:20,710
- No one has ever taken the Rock. - Archers!

806
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,910
The Lannister Army is still the army my father built.

807
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,080
- Come on! - Well-trained and well-provisioned.

808
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,860
10,000 men at least.

809
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,190
They will see us coming.

810
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,690
They will be ready.

811
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,140
Draw! Loose! Loose!

812
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,600
The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.

813
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,790
The fight up the walls will be hard.

814
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,750
We will be at a disadvantage.

815
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,850
Many men will die.

816
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,140
Just as my father said they would.

817
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,890
Interesting thing about my father--

818
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,340
he built our house up from near ruin.

819
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,850
He built our army, he built Casterly Rock as we know it,

820
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:16,690
but he didn't build the sewers.

821
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,420
That was beneath him,

822
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,390
so he gave the job to the lowest person he could find--

823
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,060
me.

824
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,850
He was right, I was low.

825
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,050
The company I kept, low.

826
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,240
Women, mostly.

827
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,270
They weren't welcome at the Rock.

828
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,270
Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.

829
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,900
Couldn't walk them through the front gates,

830
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,650
I couldn't have them in my chambers,

831
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:38,380
so in the process of building the sewers,

832
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,810
I threw in something for myself.

833
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,720
It was a passage that began

834
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,290
in an out of the way cove by the sea

835
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,690
and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.

836
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,120
No better place for low pursuits than beneath the ground.

837
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:58,020
Casterly Rock is an impregnable fortress.

838
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,600
But as a good friend of mine once said,

839
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,240
"Give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."

840
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,260
And so it begins.

841
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,450
They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.

842
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,960
They will be outnumbered.

843
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:28,760
They will have less armor and fewer weapons.

844
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,120
But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.

845
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:40,510
The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.

846
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,300
They will be fighting for freedom

847
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,250
and the person who gave it to them.

848
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,860
They will be fighting for you.

849
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,160
And that is why they will triumph.

853
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,290
Where are they?!

854
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:39,810
Where are the rest of the Lannisters?

855
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:11,370
- It's done. - It is.

856
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:17,110
And now the rains weep o'er our halls.

857
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,910
Did we fight well?

858
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,790
Uh, as well as could be expected.

859
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,550
It was never our forte.

860
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,050
Golden roses, indeed.

861
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,920
Your brother and his new queen

862
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,920
thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.

863
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:37,990
The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.

864
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,700
Well, it is to me,

865
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,910
but my fond childhood memories

866
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,690
won't keep Cersei on the throne.

867
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:45,780
So you just let them take it?

868
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:48,000
For now. They won't be able to hold it.

869
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,350
Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships,

870
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,300
we emptied the larders before we left.

871
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,340
Eventually, they'll be forced to abandon their position

872
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,630
and march all the way across Westeros.

873
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:01,170
And you took your army, your real army,

874
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,080
and went where they weren't.

875
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,990
As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.

876
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,370
There are always lessons in failures.

877
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:12,310
Yes. You must be very wise by now.

878
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,870
My father always said I was a slow learner.

879
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,760
If he was so clever,

880
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,610
why didn't he take Highgarden

881
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,900
the moment your gold mines ran dry?

882
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:28,230
I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.

883
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:32,440
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?

884
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,740
How will you do it?

885
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,370
With that sword?

886
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,340
That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?

887
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,390
Not that he ever used it.

888
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,480
What did he call it?

889
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,540
Widow's Wail.

890
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,580
He really was a cunt, wasn't he?

891
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,550
I did unspeakable things to protect my family.

892
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,310
Or watched them being done on my orders.

893
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,470
I never lost a night's sleep over them.

894
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,490
They were necessary.

895
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,160
And whatever I imagined necessary

896
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,590
for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.

897
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:19,030
But your sister has done things...

898
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,970
I was incapable of imagining.

899
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,310
That was my prize mistake--

900
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,880
a failure of imagination.

901
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,780
She's a monster, you do know that?

902
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,770
To you, I'm sure.

903
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:35,120
To others as well.

904
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:39,410
But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us,

905
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,190
when people are living peacefully in the world she built,

906
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,880
do you really think they'll

907
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,240
wring their hands over the way she built it?

908
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:51,060
You love her.

909
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,630
You really do love her.

910
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,490
You poor fool.

911
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,740
She'll be the end of you.

912
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,520
Possibly.

913
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,360
Not much to be gained

914
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,470
from discussing it with you, though, is there?

915
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,200
What better person to discuss it with?

916
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,130
What better guarantee could you have

917
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,740
that the things you say will never leave this room?

918
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,760
But perhaps you're right.

919
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,480
If she's driven you this far,

920
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,300
it's gone beyond your control.

921
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:22,320
Yes.

922
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,460
It has.

923
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,720
She's a disease.

924
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,690
I regret my role in spreading it.

925
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,430
You will, too.

926
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,180
I think we're done here.

927
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,840
How will it happen?

928
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,600
Cersei had several ideas.

929
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,740
Whipping you through the streets

930
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,110
and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.

931
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:47,720
Flaying you alive and

932
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,310
hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.

933
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:54,820
I talked her out of those.

934
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,700
Will there be pain?

935
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,690
No. I made sure of that.

936
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,270
That's good.

937
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,580
I'd hate to die like your son.

938
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,050
Clawing at my neck,

939
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:38,050
foam and bile spilling from my mouth,

940
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:41,520
eyes bloodred, skin purple.

941
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,190
Must have been horrible for you,

942
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,440
as a Kingsguard, as a father.

943
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,790
It was horrible enough for me.

944
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,160
A shocking scene.

945
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,630
Not at all what I intended.

946
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:02,220
You see, I had never seen the poison work before.

947
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,530
Tell Cersei.

948
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,450
I want her to know it was me.

949
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,540
My only venture at this moment

950
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,090
is reestablishing control over this continent

951
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:01,680
and every person on it.

953
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,450
All my allies are gone.

954
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,500
I'm losing.

955
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:10,400
You can count on the Iron Bank. As soon as the gold arrives.

956
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,950
Enough with the clever plans.

986
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,230
