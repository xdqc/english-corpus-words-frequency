37
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,700
The Lannisters have declared war on house Tyrell.

38
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,320
They have declared war on Dorne.

39
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,650
We must be allies now, if we wish to survive.

40
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,880
I offer vengeance... justice...

41
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,750
Fire and blood.

42
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,340
I traveled south under orders from the Lord Commander.

43
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,770
You ought to be a Maester.

44
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,280
Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.

45
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,950
It's a map of Dragonstone.

46
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,020
That's dragonglass.

47
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,890
A mountain of it, beneath the ground.

48
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,200
John needs to know.

49
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,950
You must send me away.

50
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,120
I command you to heal yourself.

51
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,160
I command you to find the cure.

52
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,360
So why's a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?

53
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,170
I'm going to kill the queen.

54
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,080
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

55
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,040
the new king of the Iron Islands.

56
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,290
The Iron Fleet is the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen.

57
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,190
The surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift.

58
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,610
I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.

59
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,260
Shall we begin?

60
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,850
On a night like this, you came into the world.

61
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,640
I remember that storm.

62
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,030
All the dogs in King's Landing

63
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,660
howled through the night.

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,540
I wish I could remember it.

65
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,090
I always thought this would be a homecoming.

66
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,170
Doesn't feel like home.

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,770
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

68
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,580
Good.

69
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,230
Not so many lions.

70
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,110
Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms.

71
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,540
The lords of Westeros despise her.

72
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,390
Even before your arrival, they plotted against her.

73
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,010
- Now... - They cry out for their true queen?

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,190
They drink secret toasts to my health?

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,450
People used to tell my brother that sort of thing,

76
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,430
and he was stupid enough to believe them.

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,380
If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back,

78
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,350
he'd have invaded King's Landing already.

79
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,830
Conquering Westeros would be easy for you.

80
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,490
But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.

81
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,700
No.

82
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,370
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

83
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,450
without turning it into a slaughterhouse.

84
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,900
If the great houses support your claim against Cersei,

85
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,970
the game is won.

86
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,140
With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side,

87
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,030
we have powerful allies in the south.

88
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,810
I never properly thanked you for that.

89
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,810
They joined our side, my queen,

90
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,890
because they believe in you.

91
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,880
You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?

92
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,070
I did.

93
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,890
And then you served the man who overthrew him.

94
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,120
I had a choice, Your Grace--

95
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,570
serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.

96
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,040
But you didn't serve him long.

97
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,280
You turned against him.

98
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,830
Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure.

99
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,600
There have been few rulers in history

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,640
as cruel as the Mad King.

101
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,870
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

102
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,630
He simply had no interest in being king.

103
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,500
So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.

104
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,930
Your Grace,

105
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,650
when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin,

106
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,560
Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--

107
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,720
Before I came to power, you favored my brother.

108
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,490
All your spies, your little birds,

109
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,080
did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak?

110
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,050
Would those qualities have

111
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,190
made for a good king in your learned opinion?

112
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,220
Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

113
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,680
I knew nothing about you, save your existence

114
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,880
and that you were said to be beautiful.

115
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,070
So you and your friends

116
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,770
traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

117
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,680
Which you turned to your advantage.

118
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,180
Who gave the order to kill me?

119
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,780
King Robert.

120
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,480
Who hired the assassins?

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,330
Who sent word to Essos

122
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,830
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

123
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,100
Your Grace, I did what had to be done to-- -

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,350
To keep yourself alive.

125
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,580
Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.

126
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,780
Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite.

127
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,140
If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one.

128
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,410
What kind of a servant is that?

129
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,630
The kind the realm needs.

130
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,770
Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.

131
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,150
As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them.

132
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,600
I wasn't born into a great house.

133
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,810
I came from nothing.

134
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,570
I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.

135
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,100
When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

136
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?

137
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,910
Not with any king or queen, but with the people.

138
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,240
The people who suffer under despots

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,770
and prosper under just rule.

140
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,260
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

141
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,230
If you demand blind allegiance,

142
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,560
I respect your wishes.

143
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,390
Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me.

144
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,320
But if you let me live, I will serve you well.

145
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,470
I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne

146
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,500
because I choose you.

147
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,560
Because I know the people have no better chance than you.

148
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,850
Swear this to me, Varys.

149
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,940
If you ever think I'm failing the people,

150
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,040
you won't conspire behind my back.

151
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,060
You'll look me in the eye as you have done today,

152
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,040
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

153
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,440
I swear it, my queen.

154
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,390
And I swear this-- if you ever betray me,

155
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,730
I'll burn you alive.

156
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,740
I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.

157
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,240
Forgive me, my queen.

158
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,650
A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.

168
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,380
She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.

169
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,980
It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?

170
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,620
No, it didn't.

171
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,270
You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.

172
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,330
We've just decided to pardon those who once served the wrong king.

173
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,920
The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?

174
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,910
Not yet, but even those who don't worship the Lord

175
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,390
can serve his cause.

176
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,280
What does your lord expect from me?

179
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,450
"The prince who was promised will bring the dawn."

180
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,110
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

181
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,620
Your Grace, forgive me,

182
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,190
but your translation is not quite accurate.

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,630
That noun has no gender in High Valyrian,

184
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,590
so the proper translation for that prophecy would be,

185
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,630
"The prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."

186
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,870
Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?

187
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,380
No, but I like it better.

188
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,010
And you believe this prophecy refers to me?

189
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,840
Prophecies are dangerous things.

190
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,230
I believe you have a role to play.

191
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,370
As does another--

192
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,150
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

193
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,460
Jon Snow?

194
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,960
- Ned Stark's bastard? - You know him?

195
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,290
I travelled with him to the Wall

196
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,600
when he joined the Night's Watch.

197
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,220
And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow?

198
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,140
Aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is.

199
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,670
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

200
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,290
he allowed the wildlings south of the Wall

201
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,300
to protect them from grave danger.

202
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,790
As King in the North,

203
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,610
he has united those wildlings with the Northern houses,

204
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,020
so together they may face their common enemy.

205
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,600
He sounds like quite a man.

206
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,910
Summon Jon Snow.

207
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,840
Let him stand before you

208
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,000
and tell you the things that have happened to him,

209
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,830
the things that he has seen with his own eyes.

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,990
I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames,

211
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,590
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

212
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,040
And I am an excellent judge of character.

213
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,750
If he does rule the North,

214
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,610
he would make a valuable ally.

215
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,960
The Lannisters executed his father

216
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,050
and conspired to murder his brother.

217
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,410
Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.

218
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,420
Very well.

219
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,890
Send a raven north.

220
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,030
Tell Jon Snow that his queen invites him to come to Dragonstone...

221
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,890
and bend the knee.

222
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,390
Gather round. Come here.

223
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,380
You think it's really Tyrion?

224
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,780
It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.

225
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,890
Read the last bit.

226
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,970
"All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes."

227
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,380
What does that mean?

228
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,140
It's something he said to me the first night we met.

229
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,770
You know him better than any of us.

230
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,060
What do you think?

231
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,520
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

232
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,190
He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.

233
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,690
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

234
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,020
as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.

235
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,030
Join us.

236
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,280
Together, we can end her tyranny."

237
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,510
Sounds like a charmer.

238
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,610
Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde,

239
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,000
a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons--

240
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,850
a bit less charming.

241
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,120
What?

242
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,810
Fire kills wights, you told me.

243
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,750
What breathes fire?

244
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,800
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

245
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,690
- No, too dangerous. - But?

246
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,020
But if the Army of the Dead makes it past the Wall,

247
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,780
do we have enough men to fight them?

248
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,460
If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne,

249
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,720
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

250
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,330
Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.

251
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,960
But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the crown.

252
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,880
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

253
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,910
has ferried an army of savages to our shores--

254
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,910
mindless Unsullied soldiers

255
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,660
who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

256
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,520
Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground,

257
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,590
rape and enslave your women,

258
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,590
and butcher your children without a second thought.

259
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,180
This is how Olenna Tyrell

260
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,250
rewards centuries of service and loyalty.

261
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,150
You all remember the Mad King.

262
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,600
You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.

263
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,410
His daughter is no different.

264
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,570
In Essos, her brutality is already legendary.

265
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,630
She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

266
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,620
And when she grew bored of that,

267
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,610
she fed them to her dragons.

268
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,270
It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will.

269
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,390
But I need your help, my lords.

270
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,170
We must stand together, all of us...

271
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,110
if we hope to stop her.

272
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,140
She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.

273
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,370
The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.

274
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,570
How do you propose to stop them?

275
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,710
We are currently at work on a solution, my lord.

276
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,800
Lord Tarly.

277
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,310
Ser Jaime.

278
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,070
I believe you know my son.

279
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
Ser Jaime.

280
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,840
Rickard, isn't it?

281
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,910
Dickon.

282
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,920
That's it.

283
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,540
Thank you for coming.

284
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,230
The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance,

285
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,550
now more than ever.

286
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,130
They might not have come if you hadn't.

287
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,780
If my queen summons me, I answer the call.

288
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,630
And I've heard what she does to those who defy her.

289
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,350
You ride for Horn Hill today?

290
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,760
I have an army to mobilize.

291
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,860
Won't be long before the fighting starts.

292
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,130
And which side will you be fighting for?

293
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,620
You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.

294
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,290
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could do that.

295
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,430
It's a long ride back to the Reach, Ser Jaime.

296
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,500
How may I serve?

297
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,410
I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.

298
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,730
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

299
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,200
and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.

300
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,840
All her enemies.

301
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,320
Including Olenna Tyrell.

302
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,430
I'm a Tarly.

303
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,450
That name means something.

304
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,210
We're not oathbreakers. We're not schemers.

305
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,080
We don't stab our rivals in the back

306
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,820
or cut their throats at weddings.

307
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,680
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

308
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,370
You swore an oath to the crown as well, Lord Tarly.

309
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,740
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

310
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,950
She was a great woman once.

311
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,960
Now she's broken.

312
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,810
She wants revenge so badly,

313
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,190
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

314
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,820
The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.

315
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,490
I know you don't like my sister,

316
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,180
but you have to make a choice.

317
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,360
Do you fight with us

318
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,680
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

319
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,870
When the war is won,

320
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,420
the queen will need a new Warden of the South.

321
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,300
I can think of no better man

322
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,510
than Randyll Tarly.

323
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,900
The infection has spread too far.

324
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,520
You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.

325
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,150
How long?

326
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,740
It'll be years before it kills you.

327
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,870
Could be 10.

328
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,740
Could be 20.

329
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,880
But how long until...?

330
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,480
Your mind?

331
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,420
Six months, maybe fewer.

332
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,890
Pardon, Archmaester.

333
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,930
I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.

334
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,470
She had the greyscale as a baby and was cured.

335
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,990
- No. - Isn't there some way--

336
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,680
Does this look like a baby to you?

337
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,140
- No. - Have you studied

338
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,090
the varying rates of greyscale progression

339
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,880
in infants and fully grown men?

340
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,580
No.

341
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,540
Maester Cressen discovered

342
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,590
Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.

343
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,460
This is quite advanced.

344
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,400
And beyond our skills, ser.

345
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,740
Were you a commoner, I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once

346
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,920
to live out your life with the stone men.

347
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,050
As an anointed knight, I'll allow you one more day.

348
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,760
How you choose to spend that time is up to you.

349
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,730
Come, Samwell.

350
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,500
Should we send word to your family, Ser...?

351
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,370
Jorah.

352
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,540
Jorah Mormont.

353
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,430
Mormont?

354
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,920
There's no need.

355
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,000
I've been dead to them for years.

356
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,980
Come, Samwell!

357
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,980
Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?

358
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,660
No, I can't say I have.

359
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,270
I haven't seen these since

360
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,620
Robert had them removed from the throne room.

361
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,320
Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.

362
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,040
They were his trophies.

363
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,610
He couldn't keep them around.

364
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,280
They would have made him look small.

365
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,190
Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.

366
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,290
I believe he brought his whores on occasion.

367
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,280
Balerion the Dread.

368
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,960
The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.

369
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,190
His flames forged the Iron Throne

370
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,430
and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

371
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,160
Powerful...

372
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,850
but not invincible.

373
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,300
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

374
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,160
was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.

375
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,370
And if they can be wounded,

376
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,400
they can be killed.

377
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,610
The finest artillators and blacksmiths in King's Landing

378
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,500
have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.

379
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,160
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

380
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,730
If you want the Iron Throne, take it.

381
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,920
We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.

382
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,900
We should hit King's Landing now,

383
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,720
hard, with everything we have.

384
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,870
The city will fall within a day.

385
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,990
If we turn the dragons loose,

386
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,730
tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

387
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,320
It's called war.

388
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,230
You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.

389
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,560
I know how you wage war.

390
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,710
We don't poison little girls here.

391
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,550
Myrcella was innocent.

392
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,010
She was a Lannister.

393
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,230
There are no innocent Lannisters.

394
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,870
My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.

395
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,050
That's enough.

396
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,250
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

397
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,220
You will treat him with respect.

398
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,090
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

399
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,860
That's very nice to hear.

400
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,150
Of course, I can't remember a queen

401
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,820
who was better loved than my granddaughter.

402
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,080
The common people loved her.

403
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,750
The nobles loved her.

404
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,620
And what is left of her now?

405
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,320
Ashes.

406
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,070
Commoners, nobles,

407
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,870
they're all just children, really.

408
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,230
They won't obey you unless they fear you.

409
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your counsel.

410
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,360
I'm grateful to all of you.

411
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,170
But you have chosen to follow me.

412
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,280
I will not attack King's Landing.

413
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,110
We will not attack King's Landing.

414
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,990
Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?

415
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,090
By asking nicely?

416
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,080
We will lay siege to the capital,

417
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,330
surrounding the city on all sides.

418
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,590
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

419
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,090
but no food for her army or the people.

420
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,680
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

421
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,040
Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros

422
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,620
by appealing to their loyalty,

423
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,340
their love for their country.

424
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,380
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

425
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,660
we prove her point.

426
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,780
Our army should be Westerosi.

427
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,980
And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?

428
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,990
You are.

429
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,710
Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear.

430
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,280
And her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army

431
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,790
back up to King's Landing.

432
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,630
The Dornish will lay siege to the capital

433
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,520
alongside the Tyrell army.

434
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,060
Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.

435
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,010
So, your master plan is to use our armies.

436
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,060
Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?

437
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,740
The Unsullied will have another objective.

438
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,650
For decades, House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.

439
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,650
And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.

440
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,870
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

441
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,990
will sail for the Rock and take it.

442
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,630
Do I have your support?

443
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,740
You have mine.

444
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,830
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

445
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,200
Thank you all.

446
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,060
Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

447
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,860
I realize you're here out

448
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,320
of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.

449
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,840
But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done.

450
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,080
And we will bring peace back to Westeros.

451
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,240
Peace?

452
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,340
Do you think that's what we had under your father?

453
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,650
Or his father? Or his?

454
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,390
Peace never lasts, my dear.

455
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,810
Will you take a bit of advice from an old woman?

456
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,960
He's a clever man, your Hand.

457
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,880
I've known a great many clever men.

458
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,810
I've outlived them all.

459
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,250
You know why?

460
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,500
I ignored them.

461
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,330
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

462
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,800
Are you a sheep?

463
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,250
No.

464
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,060
You're a dragon.

465
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,550
Be a dragon.

466
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,300
Maje.

467
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,300
You leave tomorrow.

468
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,200
Were you going to say goodbye?

469
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,900
I will see you when I return.

470
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,870
But you don't know when that will be.

471
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,210
No one knows.

472
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,540
I wish you good fortune.

473
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,440
Missandei.

474
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,620
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

475
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,720
Why?

476
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,950
You know why.

477
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,990
I don't.

478
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,970
You are my weakness.

479
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,600
That's what I am?

480
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,650
Your weakness?

481
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,460
When Unsullied are young, the masters learn their fears.

482
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,970
One boy is scared of dogs,

483
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,340
one boy hates high places,

484
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,400
one is frightened of the ocean.

485
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,650
They make the boy sleep with dogs

486
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:34,980
or climb a cliff.

487
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,970
They throw him in the water.

488
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,080
If he learns to swim, good.

489
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,250
If he drowns, good.

490
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,570
Either way, strong Unsullied.

491
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,710
But I had no fears.

492
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,510
I was never the biggest, never the strongest...

493
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,440
but I was bravest, always.

494
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,160
- I believe it. - Until...

495
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,380
I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.

496
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,180
Now I have fear.

497
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:16,180
I do, too.

498
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,930
No.

499
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,270
I want to see you.

500
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,900
Please.

501
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,230
Might be useful.

502
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,710
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,

504
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,640
but an excellent researcher.

505
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,880
- Archmaester, I wondered if I¡­ - And this one.

506
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,010
Maester Faull was quite the opposite,

507
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,020
a brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.

508
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,430
Um, I wanted to ask you...

509
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,670
If you're going to write histories, Tarly,

510
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,940
you have to do the research.

511
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,670
If you want people to read your histories,

512
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,610
you need a bit of style.

513
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,020
I'm not writing "A Chronicle of the Wars

514
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,000
Following the Death of King Robert I"

515
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,520
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

516
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,350
What? You don't like the title?

517
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,700
What would you call it, then?

518
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,030
Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?

519
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,440
We're not poets, Tarly.

520
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,700
Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.

521
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,050
This is your moment.

522
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,880
Use it wisely.

523
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,590
I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.

524
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,250
There are two recorded cases

525
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,340
of advanced greyscale being cured.

526
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,090
I found the procedure in the study of rare diseases

527
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,420
by Archmaester Pylos.

528
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,280
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos

529
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,250
and his study of rare diseases.

530
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,150
- Oh, you are? - Yes.

531
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,580
And shall I tell you how he died?

532
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,250
From greyscale.

533
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,530
The procedure's far too dangerous,

534
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,250
which is why it's now forbidden.

536
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,330
Hello.

537
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,480
What are you doing?

538
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,910
You're Jorah Mormont,

539
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,690
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

540
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,610
My name is Samwell Tarly,

541
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,870
Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,

542
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,940
training to serve as maester at Castle Black.

543
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,440
I knew your father.

544
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,140
I was with him when he died.

545
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,270
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

546
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,550
Drink this.

547
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,750
- What is it? - Rum.

548
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,080
Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

550
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,560
If you could take off your shirt.

551
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,430
If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.

552
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,390
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,

553
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,980
and if they hear you screaming, then we're both finished.

554
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,330
Have you ever done this before?

555
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,830
No.

556
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,070
But no one else will try it, so I'm the best you've got.

557
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,730
Have a seat.

558
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,870
I'm going to have to remove

559
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,630
the entire upper layer of infected tissue,

560
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,780
then apply a medicinal ointment to the...

561
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,120
Again, I'm sorry,

562
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,210
but please try not to scream.

563
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,250
They say her dragons are bigger than Aegon's.

564
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,090
Horseshit. Cersei's just trying to frighten us.

565
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,370
I hope it's true.

566
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,720
If she lays siege to King's Landing, prices will triple.

567
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,390
As long as we get back there before they start.

568
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,450
One more round. It's a long ride.

569
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,730
Arry!

570
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,400
Hello, Hot Pie.

571
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,620
Sit down.

572
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:55,990
Who's that for?

573
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,300
Mm. This is good.

574
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,610
You think so?

575
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,880
The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.

576
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,800
Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.

577
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,580
Mm, I didn't do that.

578
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,340
You've been making pies?

579
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,810
One or two.

580
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,020
I can't believe you're here.

581
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,680
Did you meet the big lady?

582
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,770
- Big lady? - The lady knight?

583
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,240
You know, I figured she was a knight 'cause she had armor on.

584
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,670
She was looking for your sister, but I told her about you.

585
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,290
Did she ever find you?

586
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,000
She found me.

587
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,410
What happened to you, Arry?

588
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,660
You got any ale?

589
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,940
- Where you heading? - King's Landing.

590
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,490
- Why? - Heard Cersei's queen now.

591
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:19,050
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

592
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,510
That must have been something to see.

593
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,530
Boom.

594
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,220
I can't believe someone would do that.

595
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,110
Cersei would do that.

596
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,460
I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.

597
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,080
Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.

598
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,700
No, the Boltons are dead.

599
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,400
What?

600
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,160
Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a wildling army

601
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,140
and won the Battle of the Bastards.

602
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,760
He's King of the North now.

603
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,420
You're lying.

604
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,910
Why would I lie about that?

605
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,760
He's your brother, right?

606
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,030
Thanks for the pie.

607
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,480
Friends don't pay.

608
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,020
Can't believe I thought you were a boy.

609
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,620
You're pretty.

610
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,570
Thanks.

611
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,080
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

612
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,470
Try not to get killed.

613
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,830
Ah, I won't.

614
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,990
I'm like you, Arry.

615
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,790
I'm a survivor.

616
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,350
200 miles to King's Landing.

617
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,250
One bottle of rum. You think we'll make it?

618
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,090
Come in.

619
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,190
A raven, my king, from the Citadel.

620
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,370
This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarly.

621
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,800
He was my brother at the Night's Watch,

622
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,930
a man I trust as much as anyone in this world.

623
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,040
He's discovered proof that Dragonstone

624
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,300
sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

625
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:46,260
I received this a few days ago

626
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,120
from Dragonstone.

627
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,390
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

628
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,040
He is now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.

629
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,680
She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.

630
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,510
She has a powerful army at her back

631
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,190
and, if this message is to be believed,

632
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,670
three dragons.

633
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,500
Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone

634
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,910
to meet with Daenerys.

635
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,970
And I'm going to accept.

636
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,520
Accept?!

637
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,890
We need this dragonglass, my lords!

638
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,550
We know that dragonglass can destroy

639
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,610
both white walkers and their army.

640
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,960
We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.

641
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,910
But more importantly, we need allies!

642
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,590
The Night King's army grows larger by the day.

643
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,930
We can't defeat them on our own.

644
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,460
We don't have the numbers.

645
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,080
Daenerys has her own army and she has dragonfire.

646
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,410
I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.

647
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,830
Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow,

648
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,720
then sail for Dragonstone.

649
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,560
Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?

650
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,040
The Mad King invited him to King's Landing

651
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,500
- and roasted him alive. - I know that.

652
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,600
She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

653
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,710
The North is one of those seven kingdoms.

654
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,320
This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.

655
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,710
It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.

656
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,040
You know him. He's a good man.

657
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,750
Your Grace, with respect, I must agree with Lady Sansa.

658
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,810
I remember the Mad King all too well.

659
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,270
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

660
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,210
- Nor can a Lannister. - Yeah!

661
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,170
Aye. We called your brother king.

662
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,190
And then he rode south and lost his kingdom.

663
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,120
Winter is here, Your Grace.

664
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,910
We need the King in the North in the North.

665
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,540
Aye!

666
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,750
You all crowned me your king.

667
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,220
I never wanted it.

668
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,130
I never asked for it.

669
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,110
But I accepted it because the North is my home.

670
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,100
It's part of me, and I will never stop fighting for it,

671
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,520
no matter the odds.

672
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,180
But the odds are against us.

673
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,740
None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you.

674
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,540
We can never hope to defeat them alone.

675
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,870
We need allies, powerful allies.

676
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,310
I know it's a risk.

677
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,660
But I have to take it.

678
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,470
Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.

679
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,710
Daenerys is a queen.

680
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:47,390
Only a king can convince her to help us.

681
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,940
It has to be me.

682
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,010
You're abandoning your people!

683
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,860
You're abandoning your home.

684
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,540
I'm leaving both in good hands.

685
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,370
- Whose? - Yours.

686
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,580
You are my sister.

687
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,730
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

688
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:05,870
Until I return, the North is yours.

689
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,050
I delivered his bones myself.

690
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,960
Presented them to Lady Catelyn

691
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,550
as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.

692
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,460
Seems like a lifetime ago.

693
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,860
Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.

694
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,770
I was sorry when he died.

695
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,760
Your father and I had our differences,

696
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,840
but he loved Cat very much.

697
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,500
So did I.

698
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,980
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

699
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,950
Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.

700
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,430
Your father and brothers are gone,

701
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,700
yet here you stand, King in the North.

702
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,790
Last best hope against the coming storm.

703
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,350
You don't belong down here.

704
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,850
Forgive me.

705
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,990
We haven't ever talked... properly.

706
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,300
I wanted to remedy that.

707
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,410
I have nothing to say to you.

708
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,360
Not even "Thank you"?

709
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,520
If it weren't for me,

710
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,720
you'd have been slaughtered on that battlefield.

711
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,060
You have many enemies, my king,

712
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,980
but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.

713
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,830
I love Sansa,

714
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,940
as I loved her mother.

715
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,470
Touch my sister, and I'll kill you myself.

716
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,670
- Ready? - Ready?

717
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:39,310
Ready!

718
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,120
Come on.

719
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,310
Come on!

720
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:40,880
Nymeria?

721
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,040
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

722
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,550
I'm heading north, girl.

723
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,020
Back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home.

724
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,930
Come with me.

725
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,340
Come with me.

726
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,980
That's not you.

727
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,200
You can't have them all. It's not fair.

728
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,740
I'm oldest.

729
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:20,310
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

730
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,860
She's not my mama.

731
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,400
You can have Cersei.

732
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,610
I want the Mountain.

733
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,400
The Mountain killed Father.

734
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,230
He'll crush you with one hand.

735
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,840
Father got careless. That's what Mama says.

736
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,210
Will you shut up about Mama?

737
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,030
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

738
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:40,720
Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing.

739
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,560
And then I won't have to share.

740
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,400
"Mama!"

741
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,320
How can you drink this piss?

742
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,150
When we reach Sunspear,

743
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,640
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

744
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,380
The best in the world.

745
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,660
Have you ever been to Dorne?

746
00:49:58,890 --> 00:49:59,890
A few times.

747
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,960
Never stayed long.

748
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,740
A boy in every port?

749
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,260
A boy, a girl.

750
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,910
Depends on the port.

751
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,860
Could we get some more?

752
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:17,460
I thought it wasn't for you.

753
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,310
I'm developing a taste for it.

754
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,920
- He's not your servant. - It's fine.

755
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:30,500
So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.

756
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,220
Once I kill my uncle.

757
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,240
And what will you be, handsome?

758
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:36,630
Whatever my queen commands.

759
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,510
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

760
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:41,840
Oh, I see.

761
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,680
Your protector.

762
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,630
So, if someone gets too close to you...

763
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,270
He might have to intervene.

764
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,190
To hold that person back.

765
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,350
Until they've made their intentions known.

766
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,370
Why are you standing all the way over there, then?

767
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,850
A foreign invasion is underway.

768
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,310
Leave him be.

769
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,980
Seems like you don't need a protector.

770
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:17,710
Stay here.

771
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,710
We're under attack!

772
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,860
Euron.

773
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,920
You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.

774
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,150
Kill us.

775
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,930
Get it over with.

776
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,730
Give your uncle a kiss.

777
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:00,620
Little Theon!

778
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,290
Ah, come on, you cockless coward.

779
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,360
I have her.

780
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:25,390
Come and get her.

781
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,440
I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

782
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,600
And I will.

784
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,070
The war's already begun. I've drawn first blood.

785
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,160
Cersei will be ready.

786
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,080
They know we're coming.
