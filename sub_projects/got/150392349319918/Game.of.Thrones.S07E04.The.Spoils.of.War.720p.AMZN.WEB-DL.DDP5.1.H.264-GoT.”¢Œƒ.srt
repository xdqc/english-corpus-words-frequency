37
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,650
I lost this dagger.

38
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,690
To whom?

39
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,800
Tyrion Lannister.

40
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,100
Take a step toward a more productive relationship

41
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,390
with a possible ally.

42
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,320
I will allow you to mine the dragonglass

43
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,640
and forge weapons from it.

44
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,540
Thank you.

45
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,840
She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.

46
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,280
How do you propose to stop them?

47
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,160
We are currently at work on a solution.

48
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,950
I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.

49
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,940
Jon Snow came down from Castle Black

50
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,190
with a wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.

51
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,920
He's King of the North now.

52
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,290
Your sister's dead.

53
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,980
Euron has her.

54
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,800
I couldn't save her. I tried.

55
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,280
You wouldn't be here if you'd tried.

56
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,120
What about Casterly Rock?

57
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,900
We both know how expensive war can be.

58
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,440
Your vaults are empty.

59
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,640
My debt will be paid in full.

60
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,150
How will it happen?

61
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,260
Will there be pain?

62
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,990
No, I'll make sure of that.

63
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,020
I'd hate to die like your son.

64
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,610
Not at all what I intended.

65
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,870
Tell Cersei.

66
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,990
I want her to know it was me.

68
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,110
Hold that wagon!

69
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,160
You've just won the biggest prize in the world.

70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,270
What could you possibly have to be upset about?

71
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,660
Come on, you can tell me.

72
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,870
Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls

73
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,420
before saying goodbye?

74
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,890
I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.

75
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,100
There is no more High Septon.

76
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,990
No, there isn't, is there?

77
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,790
There is still the question of my prize.

78
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,770
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

79
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,770
It's not a castle.

80
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,620
How about that one? It's available.

81
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,250
You don't want Highgarden.

82
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,900
- I beg to differ. - We're at war.

83
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,610
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take it back

84
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,140
the day after you move in.

85
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,080
Besides, think of the upkeep.

86
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,040
The more you owe, the more it weighs you down.

87
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,770
Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?

88
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,030
All your new riches weighing you down?

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,340
- Move out! - They're not mine.

90
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,130
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,250
See? We pay our debts.

92
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,450
Right, just not to me.

93
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,490
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of...

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,180
whatever nameless shit heap you're from

95
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,140
with a saddlebag full of gold,

96
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,530
complaining about not getting paid.

97
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
When we win this war,

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,210
all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms

99
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,220
will be yours to choose from,

100
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,220
with no one left to take them away from you.

101
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,020
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign

102
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,350
will be quiet and peaceable.

103
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,040
Ah, stranger things have happened.

104
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Like what?

105
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,250
The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.

106
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,020
- The current harvest? - We have teams of men collecting it

107
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,530
from all the farms in the Reach.

108
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,810
Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarlys

109
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,000
and help them accelerate this process?

110
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not much for shoveling wheat.

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,700
No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest--

112
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,670
I bet you're going to have a real talent for that.

113
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,280
My lord.

114
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,000
My lord.

115
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,640
My lord.

116
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,410
I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank

117
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,350
has ever had a debt of

118
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,940
this magnitude repaid in a single installment.

119
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,120
I always considered your father

120
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,430
a very effective and efficient man,

121
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,140
but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.

122
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,960
You're too kind, my lord.

123
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,490
I am neither kind nor a lord, Your Grace.

124
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,630
I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent.

125
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,450
Its well-being is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.

126
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,290
And the current arithmetic is outstanding.

127
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,720
- Uh, the gold... - Is on its way.

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,620
My brother is supervising its transportation himself.

129
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,330
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.

130
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,470
They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.

131
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,990
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.

132
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,110
Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance

133
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,500
in some current venture.

134
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,900
My only venture at this moment

135
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,340
is reestablishing control over this continent

136
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,050
and every person on it.

137
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,720
I see a great deal of potential in that venture.

138
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,610
I imagine it would require outside investment.

139
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,830
It will, indeed.

140
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,460
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

141
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,030
My Hand, Qyburn,

142
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,800
has made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.

143
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,940
I know them well.

144
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,120
They have helped us recover significant sums

145
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,790
from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.

146
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,080
That's good to hear.

147
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,860
I, too, would like them to recover some things that belong to me.

148
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,880
Rest assured, Your Grace,

149
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,520
you can count on the Iron Bank's support.

150
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,650
As soon as the gold arrives.

151
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,700
This is for you.

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,610
The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat,

153
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,240
but your mother fought him off.

154
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,200
The other dagger,

155
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,710
the one that took her life,

156
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,890
I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart

157
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,170
if I could have.

158
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,090
I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.

159
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,860
But I am here for her now

160
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,520
to do what she would have done,

161
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,290
to protect her children.

162
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,630
Anything I can do for you, Brandon,

163
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,170
you need only ask.

164
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,750
Do you know who this belonged to?

165
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,390
No.

166
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,490
That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.

167
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,000
In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.

168
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,200
Forced from your home,

169
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,780
driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.

170
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,490
I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.

171
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,270
To go through all of that and make your way home again

172
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,340
only to find such chaos in the world,

173
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:15,960
I can only imagine--

174
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,800
Chaos is a ladder.

175
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,550
I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.

176
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,620
I'm not Lord Stark.

177
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,860
What's that?

178
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,860
Maester Wolkan built it for me

179
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,450
so I can move around more easily.

180
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,790
It's a very good idea.

181
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,990
You're leaving.

182
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,840
I don't want to leave you,

183
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,950
but when-- when they come,

184
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,570
I need to be with my family.

185
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,150
And you're safe.

186
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,890
Well, as safe as anyone can be now.

187
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,290
You don't need me anymore.

188
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,710
No, I don't.

189
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,630
That's all you've got to say?

190
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,860
Thank you.

191
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,700
Thank you?

192
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,980
For helping me.

193
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,950
My brother died for you.

194
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,150
Hodor and Summer died for you.

195
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,270
I almost died for you.

196
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,170
- Bran... - I'm not, really.

197
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,480
Not anymore.

198
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,320
I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark,

199
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,460
but I remember so much else now.

200
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,660
You died in that cave.

201
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,040
I did.

202
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,000
The kitchen girl, the redhead with the behind.

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,410
The only thing in the kitchen that you've put your cock in is the liver.

204
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,980
'Ey up. Where you going?

205
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,580
In there. I live here.

206
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,940
Fuck off.

207
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,210
I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

208
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,840
Arya Stark's dead.

209
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,440
Send for Maester Luwin or Ser Rodrik.

210
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,280
- They'll tell you who I am. - There's no Rodrik here.

211
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,260
Maester's named Wolkan.

212
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,600
Go ask Jon Snow, then, the King in the North.

213
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,090
- He's my brother. - He's a thousand miles away.

214
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,900
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

215
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,810
so, you know, best fuck off.

216
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,490
If Jon's gone, who's in charge of Winterfell?

217
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,160
The Lady of Winterfell. Lady Stark.

218
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,960
- Which Lady Stark? - You tell us.

219
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,190
You're the one impersonating her sister.

220
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,600
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

221
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste her breath on you, just like us.

222
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,180
So, for the last time, fuck off.

223
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,640
I'm getting into this castle one way or another.

224
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,240
If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.

225
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,000
But if I am and Sansa finds out you turned me away...

226
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,640
Right, you sit there.

227
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,940
Right there.

228
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,470
Don't move.

229
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,380
Right, go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

230
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,780
I ain't telling Lady Stark. You can tell her.

231
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,560
Why me?

232
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,020
- You're gonna tell her. - I'm not.

233
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,980
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking face

234
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,390
as hard as I can.

235
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,600
We told her to wait.

236
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,040
We were standing right next to her, and...

237
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,050
And-- and when we turned around, she'd gone, my lady.

238
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,120
She-- she was nothing. Some winter town girl.

239
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,810
She comes in asking for, uh, Ser Rodrik...

240
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,280
- Rodrik, yeah. Luwin, yeah. - ...and Maester Luwin.

241
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,720
And don't trouble yourself over it, my lady.

242
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,430
- We'll-- we'll find her. - You don't have to.

243
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,140
I know where she is.

244
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,920
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

245
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,080
Yes.

246
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,150
You shouldn't have run from the guards.

247
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,220
I didn't run.

248
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,710
You need better guards.

249
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,230
It suits you... Lady Stark.

250
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,030
Jon left you in charge?

251
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,200
He did.

252
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,340
I hope he comes back soon.

253
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,570
I remember how happy he was to see me.

254
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,070
When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.

255
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,370
It doesn't look like him.

256
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,590
Should've been carved by someone who knew his face.

257
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,840
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

258
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,210
We're not.

259
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,980
They say you killed Joffrey.

260
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,580
Did you?

261
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,150
I wish I had.

262
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,010
Hmm. Me, too.

263
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,930
I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.

264
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,770
However long my list got, he was always first.

265
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,560
Your list?

266
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,550
Of people I'm going to kill.

267
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,700
How did you get back to Winterfell?

268
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,930
It's a long story.

269
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,820
I imagine yours is, too.

270
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,260
Yes.

271
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,100
Not a very pleasant one.

272
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,930
Mine neither.

273
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,970
But our stories aren't over yet.

274
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,060
No, they're not.

275
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,440
Arya...

276
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,660
Bran's home, too.

277
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,180
You came home.

278
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,830
I saw you at the crossroads.

279
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,810
You saw me?

280
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,890
I see quite a lot now.

281
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,820
Bran has... visions.

282
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,430
I thought you might go to King's Landing.

283
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,350
So did I.

284
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,560
Why would you go back there?

285
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,210
Cersei's on her list of names.

286
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,460
Who else is on your list?

287
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,630
Most of them are dead already.

288
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,820
Where did you get this?

289
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,670
Littlefinger gave it to me.

290
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,870
Littlefinger? He's here?

291
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,690
He has declared for House Stark.

292
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,540
Why would he give you a dagger?

293
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,010
- He thought I'd want it. - Why?

294
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,790
Because it was meant to kill me.

295
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,870
The cutthroat... after your fall?

296
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,550
Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?

297
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,330
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

298
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,680
He's not a generous man.

299
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,730
He wouldn't give you anything

300
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,270
unless he thought he was getting something back.

301
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,590
- It doesn't matter. - What do you mean it doesn't matter?

302
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,810
I don't want it.

303
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,890
Are you sure?

304
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,420
It's Valyrian steel.

305
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,400
It's wasted on a cripple.

306
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,750
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

307
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,580
You kept your vow.

308
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,920
I did next to nothing.

309
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,630
You're too hard on yourself, my lady.

310
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm not a...

311
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,110
Thank you, Podrick.

312
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,240
Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.

313
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,170
Soon.

314
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,580
He will come back to you.

315
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,830
He'd better.

316
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,690
What happened?

317
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,680
Many things.

318
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,480
Many things?

319
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,050
Your Grace.

321
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,710
I wanted you to see it

322
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,840
before we start hacking it to bits.

323
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,510
Well, this is it. All we'll ever need.

324
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,180
There is something else I want to show you, Your Grace.

325
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,340
The children of the forest made these.

326
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,770
When?

327
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,240
A very long time ago.

328
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,620
They were right here,

329
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,150
standing where we're standing.

330
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,820
Before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.

331
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,530
Maybe even before there were men.

332
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,080
No.

333
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,360
They were here together, the children and the First Men.

334
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,150
Doing what? Fighting each other?

335
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,550
They fought together against their common enemy.

336
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,040
Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.

337
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,650
Together.

338
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,060
We need to do the same if we're going to survive.

339
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,980
Because the enemy is real.

340
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,680
It's always been real.

341
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,730
And you say you can't defeat them

342
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,440
without my armies and my dragons?

343
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,360
No, I don't think I can.

344
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,270
I will fight for you.

345
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,730
I will fight for the North.

346
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,450
When you bend the knee.

347
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,750
My people...

348
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,990
won't accept a southern ruler.

349
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Not after everything they've suffered.

350
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,450
They will if their king does.

351
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,070
They chose you to lead them.

352
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,260
They chose you to protect them.

353
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,490
Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

354
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,550
What is it?

355
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,930
We took Casterly Rock.

356
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
That's very good to hear.

357
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,910
Isn't it?

358
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,340
You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.

359
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,720
- Perhaps¡­ - You will stay.

360
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,690
All my allies are gone.

361
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,740
They've been taken from me

362
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,470
while I've been sitting here on this island.

363
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,880
- You still have the largest armies. - Who won't be able to eat

364
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,220
because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.

365
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,340
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.

366
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,070
We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.

367
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,320
Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.

368
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,160
- We have a plan. It's still the right plan. - The right plan!

369
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,540
Your strategy has lost us Dorne, 

370
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,490
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

371
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,970
- If I have underestimated our enemies¡­ - Our enemies?

372
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,760
Your family, you mean.

373
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,420
Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.

374
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,380
Enough with the clever plans.

375
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,090
I have three large dragons.

376
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

377
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,160
We've discussed this.

378
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,220
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

379
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,370
What kind of a queen am I if

380
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,660
I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?

381
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,960
A smart one.

382
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,380
What do you think I should do?

383
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,530
- I would never presume to¡­ - I'm at war.

384
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,810
I'm losing.

385
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,810
What do you think I should do?

386
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,050
I never thought that dragons would exist again.

387
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,100
No one did.

388
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,960
The people who follow you

389
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,100
know that you made something impossible happen.

390
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,280
Maybe that helps them believe

391
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,400
that you can make other impossible things happen.

392
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,290
Build a world that's different

393
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,660
from the shit one they've always known.

394
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,570
But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities,

395
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,990
you're not different.

396
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,320
You're just more of the same.

397
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,250
Don't lunge.

398
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,250
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

399
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,020
Up.

400
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,240
- And don¡¯t¡­ - Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

401
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,470
Nice sword.

402
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,480
Very nice dagger.

403
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,460
If they haven't contributed

404
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,300
the right amount of grain to the stores,

405
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,440
then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with what they've brought.

406
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,700
We can't...

407
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,660
It's been a while since I trained.

408
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,340
I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.

409
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,350
He didn't beat the Hound.

410
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,140
You did.

411
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,870
I want to train with you.

412
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,850
You swore to serve both my mother's daughters,

413
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,220
didn't you?

414
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,510
Move aside, Podrick.

415
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,770
You can't use that, my lady. It's too small.

416
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,000
I won't cut you. Don't worry.

417
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,550
I'll try not to.

418
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,610
Who taught you how to do that?

419
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,270
No one.

420
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,420
- What do you think of her? - Who?

421
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,000
I believe you know of whom I speak.

422
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,250
I think she has a good heart.

423
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,490
A good heart?

424
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,450
I've noticed you staring at her good heart.

425
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,650
There's no time for that.

426
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,710
I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes.

427
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,510
How many men do we have in the North to fight him?

428
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,980
10,000? Less?

429
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,100
- Fewer. - What?

430
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,930
Speaking of good hearts¡­ Missandei of Naath.

431
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,540
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

432
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,350
King Snow, isn't it?

433
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,770
No, that doesn't sound right.

434
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:37,960
- King Jon? - It doesn't matter.

435
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,290
Forgive me, but may I ask a question?

436
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,720
Of course.

437
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,610
Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?

438
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,450
I'm a bastard.

439
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,470
My mother and father weren't married.

440
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,400
Is the custom different in Naath?

441
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,350
We don't have marriage in Naath,

442
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,390
so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

443
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,480
That sounds... liberating.

444
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,690
Why did you leave your homeland?

445
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,560
I was stolen away by slavers.

446
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,830
I'm sorry.

447
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,090
If I may, how did a slave girl

448
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,580
come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?

449
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,240
She bought me from my master and set me free.

450
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,560
That was good of her.

451
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,110
Of course, you're serving her now, aren't you?

452
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,300
I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.

453
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,380
Because I believe in her.

454
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,100
And if you wanted to sail home to Naath tomorrow?

455
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,370
Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.

456
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,770
You believe that?

457
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,170
I know it.

458
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,350
All of us who came with her from Essos,

459
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,720
we believe in her.

460
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,440
She's not our queen because she's the daughter

461
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,390
of some king we never knew.

462
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,650
She's the queen we chose.

463
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,160
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

464
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,140
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

465
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,790
Halt!

466
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,030
Jon.

467
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,070
I didn't know you were here.

468
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,850
S-Sansa...

469
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,360
is she all right?

470
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,210
What you did for her...

471
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,140
is the only reason I'm not killing you.

472
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,540
We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.

473
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,850
We thought you were dead.

474
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,660
I should be.

475
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,480
Your sister?

476
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,790
Euron has her.

477
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,160
I came to ask the queen to help me get her back.

478
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,710
The queen is gone.

479
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,920
Where did she go?

480
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,710
Get the horses watered!

481
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,430
All the gold's safely through the gates of King's Landing.

482
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,280
Good.

483
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,860
We need to get the last of these wagons

484
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,960
over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.

485
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,830
The head of the line is ambushed,

486
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,100
the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.

487
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,750
Well, we are stretched a bit thin.

488
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,890
With your permission,

489
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,860
flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.

490
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,900
Let's give them fair warning first.

491
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,760
These men fought well at Highgarden.

492
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,980
Now, get it on this thing.

493
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,760
Lift!

494
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,210
- Ser Jaime. - Rickon.

495
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,990
Dickon.

496
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,590
I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden.

497
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,280
Your first battle?

498
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,620
And?

499
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,750
It was glorious.

500
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,730
Come on, your father's not here.

501
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,000
All my life, we've been pledged to House Tyrell.

502
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,320
I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.

503
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,380
They didn't deserve to die.

504
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,600
But Lady Olenna chose to betray her queen

505
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,350
and support the Targaryen girl.

506
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,950
So here we are.

507
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,860
I didn't expect it to smell like that.

508
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,920
Men shit themselves when they die.

509
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?

510
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,710
Well, I learned it when I was five.

511
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,320
What?

512
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,460
Listen.

513
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,110
Spears and shields! Spears and shields!

514
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,240
- What is it? - Get in line!

515
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,190
Spears and shields! Spears and shields!

516
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,870
Get in line now!

517
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,230
Form up! Come on, lads!

518
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,360
Guard those wagons!

519
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,080
Form a line! Form a line!

520
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,930
Round those spears!

521
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,810
Shield wall!

522
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,980
Fill the gaps!

523
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,330
- Archers, steady! - Hold together!

524
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,530
- Archers! - Look alive!

525
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,730
Get tight!

526
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,070
Get in line, boys!

527
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,670
- Ready! - Here they come!

528
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,690
Courage, lads! Courage!

529
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,410
Wait! Wait for it!

530
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,250
Spears out!

531
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,840
Spears out! - Steady! Hold the line!

532
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,010
- Get back to King's Landing. - I'm not abandoning my army.

533
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,260
You're the commander, not a damn infantryman.

534
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,400
Those fuckers are about to swamp us.

535
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,990
We can hold them off.

536
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,200
Dracarys!

537
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,130
Hold the line!

538
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,200
Hold!

539
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,210
- Hold it, lads! - Hold the line!

540
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,490
Throw it!

541
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,870
Hold!

542
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,240
Draw!

543
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,530
Loose!

544
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,590
- Archers! - Archers!

545
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,780
Archers, with me!

546
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,370
- Archers, to the line! - To the line!

547
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,470
- Nock! - Nock!

548
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,900
Draw!

549
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,370
- Loose! - Loose!

550
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,000
Run!

551
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,490
Qyburn's scorpion is over there.

552
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,550
Go get it, then.

553
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,430
I can't shoot with one hand.

554
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:58,780
Come on!

555
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,000
Need help!

556
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,360
Where are you?

558
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,520
Take cover!

559
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:27,740
Come on, you fucker.

560
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,470
Dracarys.

561
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,820
Flee, you idiot.

562
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,950
Come on, boy. Come on!

563
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:59,450
You idiot. You fucking idiot.

564
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,380
I'm not here to murder.

565
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,220
Bend the knee and join me.

566
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,270
Or refuse... and die.

568
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,240
You need to find a way to make her listen.

569
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,900
Whatever stands in our way...

570
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,390
we will defeat.

571
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,330
Bran saw the Night King and his army marching

572
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,830
towards Eastwatch.

573
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:16,470
Bad things are coming.
