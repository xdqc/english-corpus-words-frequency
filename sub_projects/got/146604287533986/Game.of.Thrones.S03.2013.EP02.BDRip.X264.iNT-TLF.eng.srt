1
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,116
Don't think too much, Bran.

2
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,166
Relax your bow arm.

3
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,477
<i>And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?</i>

4
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,579
Father?

5
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,622
You can't kill it, you know.

6
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,391
Why not?

7
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,795
Because the raven is you.

8
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,040
Hodor.

9
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,742
It's all right, Hodor.

10
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,144
Hodor.

11
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,753
<i>Were you inside the
wolf again, little lord?</i>

12
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:42,723
No, it was
the three-eyed raven.

13
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:44,925
<i>He's back.</i>

14
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,061
I tried to kill it,
but I couldn't.

15
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:51,031
- There was a boy.
- <i>I don't want to hear about it.</i>

16
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,500
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.

17
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,936
We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.

18
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,306
I didn't ask
for black magic dreams.

19
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,041
I know you didn't, little lord.

20
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:04,845
We need to move.

21
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,480
We don't know
who might be after us.

22
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,249
No one even knows we're alive.

23
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:11,118
And who told you that?

24
00:04:11,153 --> 00:04:13,354
<i>The three-eyed raven</i>
<i>tell you?</i>

25
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:15,423
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

26
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:20,829
<i>I don't know what other people
know and what they don't.</i>

27
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,899
I only know the Wall
is a long way off.

28
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:35,177
My mother always told me

29
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,546
you Westerosi were a grim lot.

30
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:41,917
Grim, bearded,

31
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:43,619
stinking barbarians

32
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,588
that would row
across the Narrow Sea

33
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:48,824
and steal us from our beds.

34
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:51,060
Did you ever think
you'd marry one?

35
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:55,632
I never thought
I'd marry anyone at all.

36
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,967
Never?

37
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:01,504
Not until I met
the king of the grim,

38
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,740
bearded, stinking barbarians.

39
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:12,516
Pardon me, Your Grace.

40
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,419
- My queen.
- Lord Bolton.

41
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:19,791
Let me guess which one
is the good news.

42
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:24,196
Word from Riverrun

43
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,864
and Winterfell.

44
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:33,271
I hadn't seen him in years.

45
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:37,441
I don't even know how many.

46
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,811
We'll travel
to the funeral together.

47
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,314
<i>Lord Bolton will garrison here</i>

48
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:45,750
<i>until we return.</i>

49
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:49,453
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

50
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:57,361
Something else?

51
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:00,997
By the time Bolton's
bastard got to Winterfell,

52
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:02,933
the ironborn were gone.

53
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,837
<i>They massacred everyone and
put the castle to the torch.</i>

54
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:13,209
And Bran and Rickon
have not been found.

55
00:06:16,982 --> 00:06:19,250
They may have escaped.

56
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:22,587
Or Theon may have taken them back
to the Iron Islands as hostages.

57
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:25,022
Have you received any demands?

58
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:30,027
Have you heard anything
from Theon at all?

59
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,852
Where am I?

60
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,827
Who are you?

61
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,268
What do you want?

62
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,437
I want to do this.

63
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,577
Do you know how long
it's going to take us

64
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:21,313
to get to King's Landing walking
through fields and forests?

65
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,015
Yes.

66
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:25,918
So how shall we pass the time?

67
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:27,820
By putting one foot
in front of the other.

68
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:30,189
It's going to be
a very dull walk.

69
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:31,590
I'm here to take you
to King's Landing

70
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,460
and bring back Lady Stark's
daughters in exchange.

71
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,495
Dull is fine.

72
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,297
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

73
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:42,200
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

74
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,668
Trust me on this.

75
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:45,937
People have been serving me
since I was born.

76
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:49,341
You think Lady Stark is going
to want a giant towheaded plank

77
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,944
following her around
for the rest of her life?

78
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:55,348
A week's journey with you and she'll
order you to fall on your sword.

79
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:59,085
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

80
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:00,854
I'm sure she'll let me know.

81
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:02,388
She's an honest woman.

82
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,390
All the good it's done her.

83
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,166
How did you come into
Lady Stark's service?

84
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,533
There's something
we can talk about.

85
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,468
Not your concern, Kingslayer.

86
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:18,070
It had to be recently.

87
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:20,072
You weren't with her
at Winterfell.

88
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,506
How would you know?

89
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,343
Because I visited Winterfell.

90
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:26,111
I would have noticed
your dour head

91
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:28,080
smacking into the archways.

92
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:29,615
Move.

93
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,723
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

94
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:39,658
Ah, Renly.

95
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,260
Really?

96
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:42,995
He wasn't fit
to rule over anything

97
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:44,863
more important than
a 12-course meal.

98
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,465
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

99
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:49,768
I lived with him at court since
he was a boy, don't forget.

100
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:51,903
Could hardly escape
the little tulip.

101
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:54,939
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

102
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:56,808
I knew him far better than you.

103
00:08:56,842 --> 00:08:58,810
I knew him as well as anyone.

104
00:08:58,845 --> 00:09:00,379
As a member of his Kingsguard,

105
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,181
he trusted me with everything.

106
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,615
He would have been
a wonderful king.

107
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,117
Sounds like you
quite fancied him.

108
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:07,386
I did not fancy him.

109
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,055
Oh, gods, you did.

110
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,924
<i>Did you ever tell him?</i>

111
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,760
No, of course not.

112
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:17,763
You weren't Renly's
type, I'm afraid.

113
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:21,634
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

114
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,035
You're far too much
man for him.

115
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,870
I'm not interested
in foul rumors.

116
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,906
Unless they're about me.

117
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,275
It's all true about Renly.

118
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,212
His proclivities were the
worst kept secret at court.

119
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:34,581
It's a shame the throne
isn't made out of cocks.

120
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,517
- They'd have never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth!

121
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,088
I don't blame him.

122
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,123
And I don't blame you, either.

123
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:46,360
We don't get to choose
who we love.

124
00:09:57,606 --> 00:10:00,374
- Where are you headed, then?
- South.

125
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,443
- You?
- Riverrun.

126
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:05,613
Staying off
the kingsroad, are you?

127
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,816
They get you no matter
where you go.

128
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,485
- You can't win.
- No, you really can't.

129
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,720
Looks like you're
safe enough, though.

130
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:13,389
Meaning no offense,
my lady, but...

131
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:15,824
I wouldn't
tangle with you.

132
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,895
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

133
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,004
<i>He knows who I am.</i>

134
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,472
- He doesn't.
- Maybe you're right.

135
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,241
But what if you're not?
What if he tells someone?

136
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,147
We're not doing it.

137
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,416
<i>He's an innocent man.</i>

138
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,985
More innocent than
Lady Stark's daughters?

139
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,798
Make it tighter here.

140
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,500
That's better.

141
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,536
<i>It makes you look very strong.</i>

142
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,572
No flowers.

143
00:11:04,606 --> 00:11:06,707
I said no flowers.

144
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:10,210
All these are wrong.
Bring others.

145
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,212
Yes, Your Grace.

146
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,182
Bloody flowers.

147
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,216
On the king.

148
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:19,619
Looks like a Tyrell rose.

149
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,488
Give it to Margaery
for her wedding gown.

150
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:25,057
Should be more
than enough fabric.

151
00:11:30,063 --> 00:11:31,964
Tell me what you think of her.

152
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:33,199
Who?

153
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,268
Margaery.

154
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:37,203
She's an ideal match.

155
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,172
With the Tyrells beside us,

156
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:41,408
we'll crush the Northerners.

157
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:44,611
Hang their lords,
burn their strongholds,

158
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:46,179
sow their fields with salt,

159
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:49,315
and no one will think of
rebelling for another century.

160
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,953
It is a good match, but
what do you think of her?

161
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:00,026
She's beautiful
and intelligent.

162
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,828
Yes, she is.

163
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:05,632
Her concern with the well-being of
the common people is interesting.

164
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,168
Not to me.

165
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:12,139
I only meant that to go out of
your way to endanger yourself--

166
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:14,475
This is becoming
one of the most boring

167
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,944
conversations I've ever had.

168
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:24,185
Margaery Tyrell dotes on
filthy urchins for a reason.

169
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:27,653
She dresses like
a harlot for a reason.

170
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:29,987
She married a traitor
and known degenerate

171
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:31,342
like Renly Baratheon
for a reason.

172
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:34,925
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

173
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,627
That's what
intelligent women do--

174
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,496
what they're told.

175
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,301
- You need to ask yourself--
- I don't need to do anything.

176
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,612
Better.

177
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,814
Much better.

178
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,183
I still don't believe it.

179
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,951
He didn't.
He didn't want anything.

180
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:10,654
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

181
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,625
Men only want one thing
from a pretty girl.

182
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:20,795
Littlefinger's not
in love with me.

183
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:25,365
Love is not the thing he wants.

184
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,801
He's too old.

185
00:13:28,835 --> 00:13:31,003
They never see it that way.

186
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,842
He didn't ask you
to do something for him?

187
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,077
Spy on someone or...?

188
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,980
No.

189
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,321
If he does ask you for anything

190
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,323
or try anything

191
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:55,693
or touch you,
I want you to tell me.

192
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:59,364
Why?
What will you do?

193
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,032
I will make him stop.

194
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:05,170
<i>Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</i>

195
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:07,672
Send him in.

196
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,350
Lady Sansa.

197
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:19,751
Ser Loras.

198
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:21,053
My sister Margaery
invites you to take

199
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,488
the air with her
and our grandmother

200
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,890
the Lady Olenna in the gardens.

201
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:27,626
May I escort you to them?

202
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,135
I believe you grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

203
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,337
You are too kind, Ser Loras.

204
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:45,310
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

205
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:49,715
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

206
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:53,652
A rose, a red rose.

207
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:55,354
Of course I did.

208
00:14:58,058 --> 00:14:59,825
<i>It's more your color.</i>

209
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,595
- You take it.
- Thank you.

210
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,497
You're such a dear.

211
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,566
I'll take my leave.

212
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,368
Lady Sansa.

213
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:10,571
Thank you, Ser Loras.

214
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,573
Come.

215
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:21,015
Lady Sansa, it is my honor

216
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,217
to present my grandmother...

217
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:26,754
the Lady Olenna
of House Tyrell.

218
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:28,790
Kiss me, child.

219
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:30,859
It's so good of you to visit me

220
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:32,761
and my foolish flock of hens.

221
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:35,164
We're very sorry
for your losses.

222
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,867
And I was sorry when I heard of
Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

223
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:41,103
- He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.

224
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:43,372
And charming and very clean.

225
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,307
He knew how to dress and smile

226
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:48,177
and somehow this gave him the
notion he was fit to be king.

227
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,212
Renly was brave
and gentle, Grandmother.

228
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:51,914
Father liked him
and so did Loras.

229
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,583
Loras is young and very good

230
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,552
at knocking men
off horses with a stick.

231
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:58,254
That does not make him wise.

232
00:15:58,289 --> 00:15:59,656
As to your
fathead father--

233
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,492
Grandmother! What will
Sansa think of us?

234
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:04,927
<i>She might think we have</i>
<i>some wits about us.</i>

235
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:06,662
One of us, at any rate.

236
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,432
It was treason.
I warned them.

237
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,402
Robert has two sons and
Renly has an older brother.

238
00:16:12,436 --> 00:16:14,537
How could he possibly
have any claim

239
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:17,173
to that ugly iron chair?

240
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,243
We should have stayed well out
of all this if you ask me.

241
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,145
But once the cow's been milked,

242
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,748
there's no squirting
the cream back up her udders.

243
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,818
So here we are
to see things through.

244
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,455
What do you say to that, Sansa?

245
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,525
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

246
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,126
Lemon cake's my favorite.

247
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,295
So we've been told.

248
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,832
Are you going to bring the food or
do you mean to starve us to death?

249
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,668
Here, Sansa,

250
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,804
come sit with me.

251
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,274
I'm much less boring
than these others.

252
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,046
Do you know my son?

253
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,914
The Lord of Highgarden?

254
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,150
I haven't had the pleasure.

255
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:59,152
No great pleasure, believe me.

256
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,687
A ponderous oaf.

257
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,722
<i>His father was an oaf as well.</i>

258
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:05,525
<i>My husband,</i>
<i>the late Lord Luthor.</i>

259
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,461
He managed to ride off
a cliff whilst hawking.

260
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:10,664
They say he was looking
up at the sky

261
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:14,201
and paying no mind to where
his horse was taking him.

262
00:17:14,235 --> 00:17:16,236
And now my son
is doing the same,

263
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,940
only this time he's riding
a lion instead of a horse.

264
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:22,543
Now...

265
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:24,946
I want you to tell me the truth

266
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:28,917
about this royal boy,
this Joffrey.

267
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:31,119
I... I...

268
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,588
You, you.

269
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:34,356
Who else would know better?

270
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:37,193
We've heard
some troubling tales.

271
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:39,962
Is there any truth to them?

272
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:42,398
<i>Has this boy mistreated you?</i>

273
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:44,767
Has he ripped out your tongue?

274
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:47,236
Joff-- King Joffrey,

275
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,506
he-- His Grace
is very fair

276
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,609
and handsome
and as brave as a lion.

277
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:56,245
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.

278
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,982
And when a Tyrell farts,
it smells like a rose.

279
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:02,284
<i>But how kind is he?</i>
<i>How clever?</i>

280
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:04,820
Has he a good heart,
a gentle hand?

281
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,288
I'm to be his wife.

282
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:08,523
I only want to know
what that means.

283
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,866
Bring me some cheese.

284
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,268
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

285
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,603
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

286
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:24,205
And I want it served now.

287
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,411
Are you frightened, child?

288
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,346
No need for that.

289
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,281
We're only women here.

290
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:37,618
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

291
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:41,655
My father always
told the truth.

292
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:43,757
Yes, he had that reputation.

293
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,226
And they named him traitor
and took his head.

294
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:49,163
Joffrey.

295
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:51,098
Joffrey did that.

296
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:54,502
He promised he would be merciful
and he cut my father's head off.

297
00:18:54,536 --> 00:18:56,337
And he said that was mercy.

298
00:18:56,372 --> 00:19:00,207
Then he took me up on the
walls and made me look at it.

299
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:06,247
Go on.

300
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:10,384
I-- I can't.
I never meant--

301
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:12,620
my father was a traitor.

302
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:15,089
My brother as well.
I have traitor's blood.

303
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:16,791
Please don't make me
say anymore.

304
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,325
She's terrified, Grandmother.

305
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,796
- Just look at her.
- Speak freely, child.

306
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,633
We would never betray your
confidence, I swear it.

307
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,504
He's a monster.

308
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,507
Ah.

309
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:35,476
<i>That's a pity.</i>

310
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,912
Please, don't stop the wedding.

311
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:40,614
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

312
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:43,483
<i>is determined that</i>
<i>Margaery shall be queen.</i>

313
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:46,987
Even so, we thank you
for the truth.

314
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,823
Ah, here comes my cheese.

315
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:07,040
<i>We're at war.</i>

316
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:09,610
<i>This march is a distraction.</i>

317
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:12,813
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

318
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:15,816
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

319
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,884
Then it's a distraction.

320
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,987
My Uncle Edmure has his
forces garrisoned there.

321
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:22,889
We need his men.

322
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,225
Unless he's been breeding them,

323
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,227
he don't have enough
to make a difference.

324
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:29,863
Have you lost faith
in our cause?

325
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,500
If it's revenge,
I still got faith in it.

326
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:35,401
If you no longer
believe--

327
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:38,070
I can believe
till it snows in Dorne.

328
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:41,708
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

329
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,112
You don't think we can win?

330
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:48,281
May I speak my mind,
Your Grace?

331
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:51,784
Have you not been speaking
your mind, Lord Karstark?

332
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,720
I think you lost this war

333
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,923
the day you married her.

334
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,369
Whoa, whoa.

335
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,472
Your Grace.

336
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:14,108
You're afraid of her.

337
00:21:14,143 --> 00:21:16,845
- And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.

338
00:21:26,388 --> 00:21:29,056
May I help you, Lady Stark?

339
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:30,725
No.

340
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,261
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have--

341
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:34,796
You can't help because a mother

342
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,000
makes one for her
children to protect them.

343
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,937
Only a mother can make them.

344
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,878
You've made them before?

345
00:21:52,314 --> 00:21:54,581
Twice.

346
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:56,750
Did they work?

347
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:00,921
After a fashion.

348
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:07,194
I prayed for my son Bran
to survive his fall.

349
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,900
Many years before that,

350
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:15,436
one of the boys came down
with the pox.

351
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,641
Maester Luwin said if he made it
through the night, he'd live.

352
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:23,478
But it would be
a very long night.

353
00:22:25,915 --> 00:22:29,418
So I sat with him
all through the darkness.

354
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,956
Listened to his ragged
little breaths,

355
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,826
his coughing, his whimpering.

356
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,961
<i>Which boy?</i>

357
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:42,131
Jon Snow.

358
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:46,769
When my husband brought
that baby home from the war,

359
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:49,272
I couldn't bear to look at him.

360
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:51,741
I didn't want
to see those brown

361
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:55,045
<i>stranger's eyes</i>
<i>staring up at me.</i>

362
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:58,016
<i>So I prayed to the gods,</i>
<i>take him away.</i>

363
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,551
Make him die.

364
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:04,521
He got the pox.

365
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:11,596
<i>And I knew I was the worst</i>
<i>woman who ever lived.</i>

366
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:15,633
A murderer.

367
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:19,904
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child

368
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:22,373
to a horrible death

369
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:24,942
all because I was
jealous of his mother.

370
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:28,379
A woman he didn't even know.

371
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:31,583
So I prayed to all seven gods,

372
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:34,786
let the boy live.

373
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,255
Let him live

374
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,323
and I'll love him.

375
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:42,660
I'll be a mother to him.

376
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:46,431
I'll beg my husband
to give him a true name,

377
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,401
to call him Stark
and be done with it,

378
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:51,003
to make him one of us.

379
00:23:51,037 --> 00:23:53,305
And he lived.

380
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,141
And he lived.

381
00:23:58,044 --> 00:24:00,479
And I couldn't keep my promise.

382
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:07,553
<i>And everything</i>
<i>that's happened since then...</i>

383
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:12,358
<i>all this horror</i>
<i>that's come to my family...</i>

384
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:18,631
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

385
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,912
Was it hard for you
to kill the Halfhand?

386
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,683
Yes.

387
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:38,152
You liked him?

388
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,854
I like you, but if
you're playing us false,

389
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:42,823
it won't be hard
for me to kill you.

390
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,592
I've got wildling
blood in my veins.

391
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:47,695
- These are my people.
- I understand.

392
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:50,631
Well, how could you understand?

393
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:52,933
You want to protect
your people.

394
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:56,136
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

395
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:58,439
half of whom want
to massacre the other half

396
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,875
for one insult or another?

397
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,679
They speak seven different
languages in my army.

398
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:06,681
<i>The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.</i>

399
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:08,616
<i>The Hornfoots hate</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

400
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,252
Everyone hates the cave people.

401
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:14,655
So you know how I got
moon worshippers

402
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:16,824
and cannibals and giants

403
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,127
to march together
in the same army?

404
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:20,528
No.

405
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:23,398
I told them we were
all going to die

406
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:25,400
if we don't get south.

407
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:27,569
Because that's the truth.

408
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:41,249
Shouldn't be long now.

409
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:54,630
What's wrong with him?

410
00:25:54,664 --> 00:25:56,765
<i>He's a warg.</i>

411
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,869
He can enter the mind of
animals, see through their eyes.

412
00:25:59,903 --> 00:26:01,403
He's scouting for us.

413
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:04,106
What, you've never met a warg?

414
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,283
<i>Orell.</i>

415
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:27,695
Where were you this time?

416
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:34,969
The Fist of the First Men.

417
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:37,406
What did you see?

418
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,945
Dead crows.

419
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:54,722
What's the matter, Piggy?

420
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:56,724
You crying 'cause you're cold?

421
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:03,365
There's 200 brothers
killed by dead men

422
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:05,900
and you're still here

423
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:08,470
whimpering.

424
00:27:08,504 --> 00:27:10,705
That seem fair to you?

425
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,842
I seen 'em torn
to pieces fighting

426
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:16,577
while you was off somewhere
hiding in a hole.

427
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,581
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

428
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,252
You know you want to.

429
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:43,001
Hey.

430
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:50,008
Get up, Sam.

431
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,678
- No.
- <i>Get up.</i>

432
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,279
I can't.

433
00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:56,848
If you stop, you'll die.

434
00:27:56,882 --> 00:28:00,584
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

435
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:03,887
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.

436
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:06,190
You left me.

437
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:09,626
When the white walkers came,
you left me.

438
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:12,296
Aye, we left you.

439
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:14,665
<i>You're fat and you're slow.</i>

440
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,901
We didn't want to die.

441
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:20,505
Help me get him up.

442
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,307
Looks like that piggy
is done for.

443
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,476
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.

444
00:28:25,544 --> 00:28:27,111
Just get him up!

445
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:30,214
Why? So the rest
of us can die?

446
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,018
We'll move faster without him.

447
00:28:34,052 --> 00:28:37,488
What is this?
Get up, Tarly.

448
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:41,426
- Is he all right?
- Aye, I think so.

449
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,227
If he can't, we may as
well just go without him.

450
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:45,129
That's enough.

451
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:47,198
Tarly,

452
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,566
I forbid you to die.

453
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:51,836
Do you hear me?

454
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,571
- Why should the rest of us--
- Rast...

455
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:57,074
you're responsible for him.

456
00:28:57,108 --> 00:28:59,142
What am I supposed to do?

457
00:28:59,177 --> 00:29:01,211
Make sure he gets back alive.

458
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,013
If he doesn't, you don't.

459
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:06,916
Move on!

460
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:15,091
I'm not dying for you, Piggy.

461
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:16,960
You hear me?

462
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:44,222
Where's Rickon and Hodor?

463
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:47,559
Looking for food.

464
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:52,197
What's out there?

465
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:43,849
<i>Not another step, boy.</i>

466
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,019
<i>Unless you want to drown</i>
<i>in your own blood.</i>

467
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,420
I'm unarmed.

468
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:50,289
That was poor planning.

469
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:52,525
My sister carries the weapons.

470
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:57,063
I'm better with them.

471
00:30:57,097 --> 00:30:59,432
<i>Drop the spear.</i>

472
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:04,036
<i>Drop it.</i>

473
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:08,507
If you kill me,

474
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:11,177
that wolf will tear
you to bits.

475
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,653
You must be Summer.

476
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,980
I'm Jojen Reed.

477
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:48,083
This is my sister Meera.

478
00:31:52,122 --> 00:31:54,790
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

479
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:58,729
And we have much farther to go.

480
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:04,068
I'm just
trying to understand.

481
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:06,937
Would you please
shut up about it?

482
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:08,672
Jaqen H'ghar offered
you three kills.

483
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:10,907
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.

484
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:13,644
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted.

485
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:16,380
Dead. All you had to do
was give him the names.

486
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:19,116
Anyone. You could have
picked King Joffrey.

487
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:21,184
- Shut up.
- You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

488
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:22,686
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal,

489
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,454
so why are you complaining?

490
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,290
But you could have
ended the war.

491
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:29,059
- Where are we going?
- North.

492
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:30,494
If we were going north,

493
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,162
we should have come to the
Red Fork River by now.

494
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:34,331
Maybe we already passed it.

495
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:35,999
It's 100 feet wide.

496
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:38,267
How could we have passed it?

497
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:40,736
If we hit the Red Fork,

498
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:42,238
we can follow it west
to Riverrun.

499
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:43,773
My mother grew up there.

500
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:46,142
My grandfather's a lord.
He'll protect us.

501
00:32:49,113 --> 00:32:50,680
Could be a minstrel.

502
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:52,849

517
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,307
You go on down the road.

518
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,309
Just keep on singing
so we know where you are.

519
00:33:51,343 --> 00:33:54,946
Leave us be
and I won't kill you.

520
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,584
Generous.

521
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:02,087
You're a dangerous person.

522
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,957
I like dangerous people.

523
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,662
Why are your friends so shy?

524
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,832
What friends?

525
00:34:12,866 --> 00:34:16,103
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

526
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,993
Three young ones on the run

527
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:42,497
carrying
castle-forged swords.

528
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:44,031
You escape from Harrenhal?

529
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:46,667
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Thoros of Myr.

530
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,736
And the fellow here
with the bow is Anguy.

531
00:34:48,804 --> 00:34:50,171
No, who do you fight for?

532
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:52,240
<i>The Brotherhood</i>
<i>without Banners.</i>

533
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,811
Now come along.

534
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,446
I want to hear how two boys

535
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:02,017
and a very dangerous girl
escaped Harrenhal.

536
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,720
I'm not going with them.
The Brotherhood?

537
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:07,290
That's who the Mountain
and them lot were looking for.

538
00:35:07,324 --> 00:35:09,125
They'll bring us back
and put rats in us.

539
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:11,159
You've got nothing
to fear from us, son.

540
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:13,995
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

541
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,930
We're trying to save it.

542
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:17,566
Now come on.

543
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,301
We'll talk some more
over brown bread and stew.

544
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,436
And then you can go
on your way.

545
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,080
Here's the thing, fat boy.

546
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:36,919
When I'm done talking,

547
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:39,856
that arrow's falling down
on your fat head.

548
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,258
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

549
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,608
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

550
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:04,111
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

551
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:15,990
My lion.

552
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:19,727
We've spoken of this.

553
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:22,463
You cannot come here.

554
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:28,236
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

555
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,071
Did anyone see you?

556
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,273
- No.
- You sure?

557
00:36:32,308 --> 00:36:34,609
My father does not
make idle threats.

558
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:37,980
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

559
00:36:38,014 --> 00:36:40,016
You have to be
absolutely certain.

560
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:45,722
All right.

561
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:47,757
What is this problem?

562
00:36:49,526 --> 00:36:51,627
I'm worried about Sansa.

563
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:53,495
When she spoke
with Lord Baelish,

564
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,966
his friend warned me about him.

565
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,101
Baelish doesn't have friends.

566
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,871
I don't know her name.

567
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:05,040
- Oh, Ros? The redhead?
- How do you know her?

568
00:37:05,075 --> 00:37:07,276
I try to know
as many people as I can.

569
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,078
You never know
which one you'll need.

570
00:37:09,112 --> 00:37:10,846
She's a whore.

571
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:13,982
Yes, well, we shouldn't be
judgmental about these things.

572
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:17,319
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.

573
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:20,089
All right, yes,
I fucked her once.

574
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:23,725
Twice.

575
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:27,829
But since I met you, my lady,

576
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:30,331
I've been with no one else.

577
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:35,470
And was she good?
Did you like her?

578
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,205
Not as much
as I like you, obviously,

579
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:40,008
or she'd be the one
torturing me right now.

580
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:45,714
What did she say
about Littlefinger?

581
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:50,018
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

582
00:37:50,053 --> 00:37:52,955
Is there an idiot
in any village

583
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:54,957
who trusts Littlefinger?

584
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,294
We have to protect her.

585
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:00,529
We can't.

586
00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:03,498
Now that the Lannisters
have discarded her,

587
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,934
Sansa will have many suitors.

588
00:38:05,968 --> 00:38:09,204
A great beauty
with a very old name.

589
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:12,374
A great beauty?
Oh, a great beauty?

590
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:15,477
Yes, she is, objectively, very.

591
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:18,046
Her face
is quite pleasing--

592
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,748
to other men and to women,

593
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:21,650
people in general.

594
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:23,619
But not to me, of course.

595
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:26,822
I only have eyes for you.

596
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:29,491
You pervert.
You want her?

597
00:38:29,526 --> 00:38:32,694
- This child?
- I don't even want to talk about her.

598
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,464
- But you are.
- Only because you're making me.

599
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:39,000
I didn't force
you to open your mouth

600
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:41,069
and make words come out.

601
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:44,306
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.

602
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,074
"Oh, the cruelty.

603
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,544
Shae is so cruel to me."

604
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:52,681
Hmm, yes.

605
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,959
Now do you think I'm cruel?

606
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,761
Only if you stop.

607
00:39:08,898 --> 00:39:11,601
But you mustn't
come here again.

608
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:16,606
Do you hear me?

609
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:20,577
You've come to
a dangerous place

610
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:23,146
full of dangerous people.

611
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:28,351
Dangerous people.

612
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:39,662
<i>Lady Tyrell, my king.</i>

613
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:41,564
Send her in.

614
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:58,615
You wanted to see me,
Your Grace?

615
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,384
I'm leaving on a hunting trip.

616
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:02,786
I just wanted to make sure

617
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,688
you had everything
you need before I left.

618
00:40:04,722 --> 00:40:06,957
That's very thoughtful,
Your Grace.

619
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:08,759
I have everything I could want.

620
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:09,994
Good. Good.

621
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:12,730
How are you finding life
in the capital?

622
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:15,432
It must be quite a change
after Renly's camp.

623
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,334
A welcome one.

624
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:21,705
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

625
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,141
And the bedside of a traitor?

626
00:40:26,611 --> 00:40:29,212
Is that a place for a lady?

627
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:33,183
Your Grace,

628
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:36,153
I tried to do my duty
as a wife, that is all.

629
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:39,756
What was your duty to this
traitor as you saw it?

630
00:40:39,824 --> 00:40:41,992
The duty of any wife
to any husband--

631
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:43,726
to provide him with children.

632
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,828
<i>You failed to do this.</i>

633
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:49,065
- Why?
- <i>I--</i>

634
00:40:51,268 --> 00:40:54,069
I would not speak ill
of the dead, Your Grace.

635
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:56,037
You think one ought
to speak kindly

636
00:40:56,072 --> 00:40:58,874
of a traitor merely because he's
had a sword put through his heart?

637
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:00,742
No.

638
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:03,612
I do beg your pardon.

639
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:06,915
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

640
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:09,351
Renly...

641
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,855
I don't believe
he was interested

642
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,291
<i>in the company of women.</i>

643
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:19,761
What makes you say this?

644
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:25,034
Whenever I wanted
to make a child with him,

645
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,503
he--

646
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:29,572
he had so many excuses,

647
00:41:29,606 --> 00:41:31,741
so many late-night
war councils.

648
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:34,110
He never wanted to try.

649
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,247
Except one evening,

650
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:41,083
after he'd had far too
much wine to drink,

651
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,586
he suggested something--

652
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:50,626
something that sounded
very painful

653
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:52,761
and couldn't possibly
result in children.

654
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:56,698
Maybe the fault was with me.

655
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:59,768
No, he was a known...

656
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:01,370
degenerate.

657
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:04,839
It's such a relief to hear
you say so, Your Grace.

658
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:06,574
Mmm.

659
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:09,310
I've considered
making his perversion

660
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:11,345
punishable by death.

661
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,515
As is your right.

662
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,119
You must do whatever
you need to do.

663
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:24,357
You are the king.

664
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,593
Yes.

665
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,031
I am.

666
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:38,639
Do you like it?

667
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:40,574
I just had it made.

668
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:43,377
Probably one of the finest
weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

669
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:44,812
It's beautiful.

670
00:42:44,846 --> 00:42:47,047
Will you show me how it works?

671
00:42:51,286 --> 00:42:52,820
It's a new design.

672
00:42:52,855 --> 00:42:55,289
Much easier to load.
There's no crank.

673
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:59,293
You use this lever
to draw the string.

674
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:06,901
The bolt goes here.

675
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,940
And then you just aim...

676
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,278
and...

677
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:24,785
Would you take me
hunting sometime?

678
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:26,753
Forgive me, Your Grace.

679
00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:28,922
I know a hunt
is no place for a woman.

680
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:30,524
It's not unheard of.

681
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:32,860
My father would never
let me before--

682
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:35,295
You no longer belong to him.

683
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,265
Do you want to hold it?

684
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,367
May I?
Please.

685
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,345
I imagine it must be
so exciting

686
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,380
to squeeze your finger here

687
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:55,083
and watch something
die over there.

688
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:01,622
Could you do it?

689
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:03,657
Could you...

690
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:05,993
kill something?

691
00:44:07,462 --> 00:44:09,663
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

692
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:12,032
Yes.

693
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,468
Would you like to watch me?

694
00:44:18,507 --> 00:44:20,408
Yes.

695
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:24,679
Stop! Stop!

696
00:44:24,713 --> 00:44:27,082
- <i>Tell us the truth.</i>
- About what?

697
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:31,053
I don't
know what you want.

698
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,321
I want the truth.

699
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:35,123
What truth?

700
00:44:35,158 --> 00:44:37,125
Why'd you take Winterfell?

701
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:39,561
I took it to--
I took it--

702
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:40,996
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

703
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,564
- I took it on my own.
- <i>Why?</i>

704
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,599
To take the North
while it was vulnerable.

705
00:44:44,634 --> 00:44:46,368
What were you going
to do once you took it?

706
00:44:46,402 --> 00:44:48,136
Hold it.
Rule it.

707
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,873
Good.
That's very good.

708
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:58,546
Why did you do that?
I told you.

709
00:44:58,581 --> 00:45:00,215
Why did you take Winterfell?

710
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:03,517
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

711
00:45:11,293 --> 00:45:13,294
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

712
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:16,764
I took it because
I hated the Starks.

713
00:45:16,799 --> 00:45:19,167
I hated them
for holding me prisoner.

714
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:21,636
I wanted to hurt them.

715
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:29,510
What are you doing?

716
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:34,682
Please.

717
00:45:39,755 --> 00:45:42,589
I'll tell you anything.

718
00:45:42,624 --> 00:45:44,625
Just take it off.

719
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:47,761
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, just take it off.</i>

720
00:45:56,904 --> 00:46:00,073
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

721
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,684
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

722
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:11,753
No, don't go.
Please, please.

723
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:13,455
No, please don't leave me.

724
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:15,190
Please, please.

725
00:46:15,224 --> 00:46:16,625
Please, please don't go!

726
00:46:16,659 --> 00:46:21,364
Please. Please.
Don't leave me.

727
00:46:21,398 --> 00:46:24,066
Please don't go.

728
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:30,939
Rickon, stay with us.

729
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:35,710
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.

730
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:46,989
You can get inside his head,

731
00:46:47,023 --> 00:46:49,124
see through his eyes.

732
00:46:49,158 --> 00:46:50,525
Only when I'm asleep.

733
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,095
That's how it begins until
you learn to control it.

734
00:46:53,129 --> 00:46:54,496
You're a warg.

735
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:57,232
It's not just wolves.

736
00:46:57,267 --> 00:46:59,067
Sometimes in my dreams
there's a--

737
00:46:59,102 --> 00:47:01,837
- A three-eyed raven?
- <i>You've seen it?</i>

738
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:04,106
We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten?

739
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,842
Does it have anything
to do with warging?

740
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:09,611
No, the raven
is something different,

741
00:47:09,645 --> 00:47:11,980
something deeper.

742
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:13,481
The raven brings the sight.

743
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:16,484
Seeing things
that haven't happened yet?

744
00:47:16,518 --> 00:47:18,753
<i>Or things that happened</i>
<i>long before you were born</i>

745
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:22,490
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

746
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:24,859
What's he telling him?

747
00:47:24,894 --> 00:47:27,095
Why don't you ask?

748
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,565
Isn't he ashamed, your brother,

749
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,300
needing you to protect him?

750
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,102
Where's the shame in that?

751
00:47:35,137 --> 00:47:38,739
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

752
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:42,609
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

753
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:47,047
Some people
will always need help.

754
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:49,416
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>they're not worth helping.</i>

755
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:57,091
When my father died,
I dreamt it.

756
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,461
You didn't dream it.
You saw it.

757
00:48:00,529 --> 00:48:02,430
So did I.

758
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:04,065
You have the sight, too?

759
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:11,205
When I told my father
about your father...

760
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:15,776
for the first time
in my life, I saw him cry.

761
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,511
Your father is Howland Reed?

762
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:19,245
Yeah.

763
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,549
He saved my father's life
during the rebellion.

764
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,384
Your father told you
about the rebellion?

765
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,419
Mine never did.

766
00:48:26,454 --> 00:48:28,288
But I saw that, too.

767
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,524
What else have you seen?

768
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:33,526
Only one thing
that matters--

769
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:35,662
you.

770
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:48,375
<i>I never liked
the skinny ones.</i>

771
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,277
<i>Like drinking from a puddle.</i>

772
00:48:50,312 --> 00:48:52,113
Not that I'm averse
to drinking from a puddle

773
00:48:52,147 --> 00:48:53,448
every now and again,
you understand.

774
00:48:53,482 --> 00:48:55,483
I don't drink ale.

775
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:58,220
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

776
00:48:58,254 --> 00:48:59,988
- Yeah!
- You see?

777
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:02,258
They've all suffered through
my bouts of sobriety.

778
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:04,593
It's very tedious
for all concerned.

779
00:49:04,627 --> 00:49:07,095
Now, how did
three children--

780
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:08,664
We're not children.

781
00:49:08,698 --> 00:49:11,433
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

782
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:14,036
untrained in the art of war,

783
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,705
escape from Harrenhal?

784
00:49:18,074 --> 00:49:20,042
Gendry's a smith.

785
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:21,744
He was apprenticed
in the armory.

786
00:49:21,778 --> 00:49:25,081
A smith, eh?
Where'd you train?

787
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:31,054
King's Landing.
Tobho Mott's shop.

788
00:49:31,088 --> 00:49:33,223
That criminal.
He charges twice as much

789
00:49:33,257 --> 00:49:34,724
as every other armorer
in the city.

790
00:49:34,759 --> 00:49:36,393
That's because
he's twice as good.

791
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,796
Aha! A smith
and a salesman.

792
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:42,065
Gendry stole us weapons.

793
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,935
Ah, fought your way
out of Harrenhal, I see.

794
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:48,505
He knows how to use a
sword and so do I.

795
00:49:49,974 --> 00:49:52,042
My brothers taught me.

796
00:49:55,513 --> 00:49:58,682
Ooh!

797
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:16,400
To your brothers!

798
00:50:22,707 --> 00:50:25,275
You can finish
your meals before you go.

799
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,744
It may be awhile
before you see another.

800
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:30,814
- You'll free us?
- I gave you my word.

801
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,318
But before you go,

802
00:50:35,352 --> 00:50:38,620
allow me to raise
a cup to your--

803
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:41,223
Hey, hey.

804
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:43,959
Now that is an uncommonly
large person.

805
00:50:43,994 --> 00:50:45,528
How does one manage to subdue

806
00:50:45,562 --> 00:50:47,329
such an uncommonly
large person?

807
00:50:47,363 --> 00:50:50,065
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

808
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,901
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.

809
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:58,206
Aha, not a man at all.

810
00:50:59,342 --> 00:51:02,310
A Hound!

811
00:51:02,378 --> 00:51:04,946
So good to see
you again, Clegane.

812
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:06,948
Thoros?

813
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:09,384
The fuck you doing here?

814
00:51:09,418 --> 00:51:11,319
Drinking and talking too much.

815
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:13,355
Same as ever.

816
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:16,892
- A pretty prize, lads.
- Yeah!

817
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:20,563
Girl.

818
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:24,100
What in seven hells

819
00:51:24,134 --> 00:51:26,603
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

820
00:51:37,649 --> 00:51:40,218
It's a tough decision--

821
00:51:40,252 --> 00:51:42,253
take the bridge
and risk being seen

822
00:51:42,288 --> 00:51:44,189
or cross the great water.

823
00:51:44,223 --> 00:51:46,791
- Silence, Kingslayer.
- Anyone can see us on the bridge,

824
00:51:46,825 --> 00:51:49,828
but cross by water
and the current could take us

825
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:51,829
or I could escape
down the river.

826
00:51:51,864 --> 00:51:53,731
Good luck.

827
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:59,737
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

828
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:01,906
Which will she choose?

829
00:52:06,813 --> 00:52:08,780
Gambler at heart.

830
00:52:08,815 --> 00:52:10,249
Wouldn't have guessed.

831
00:52:10,283 --> 00:52:12,418
Be quick about it.

832
00:52:19,527 --> 00:52:20,927
- I need to rest.
- Get up.

833
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:23,396
I have these, you know, on your
feet when you walk too far.

834
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,597
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

835
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:27,133
Corns. I never
used to get corns.

836
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:29,501
<i>Of course I used</i>
<i>to ride everywhere,</i>

837
00:52:29,536 --> 00:52:32,004
not march around
like a common foot soldier

838
00:52:32,038 --> 00:52:34,272
wearing the same shit boots
for over a year.

839
00:52:34,307 --> 00:52:36,708
This heel is ruined.
There's no way--

840
00:52:44,816 --> 00:52:48,453
I never understood why some knights
felt the need to carry two swords.

841
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:05,537
Ooh.

842
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:11,309
You move well...

843
00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:16,313
for a great beast of a woman.

844
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,318
You shouldn't grimace
before you lunge.

845
00:53:22,352 --> 00:53:24,853
It gives away the game.

846
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,703
<i>Bit of a quandary for you.</i>

847
00:53:40,737 --> 00:53:43,606
If you kill me,
you fail Lady Stark.

848
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,242
<i>But if you don't kill me,</i>

849
00:53:46,276 --> 00:53:48,578
I'm going to kill you.

850
00:53:54,452 --> 00:53:56,286
You're good.

851
00:53:56,321 --> 00:53:58,522
Graceless, but good.

852
00:54:07,532 --> 00:54:09,800
See? If you were
willing to hurt me,

853
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,635
you might have had me there.

854
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:57,784
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

855
00:54:57,818 --> 00:54:59,853
if you can call that a woman.

856
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:01,955
We enjoy a good fight.

857
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:04,257
Gets our juices flowing.

858
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:07,160
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.

859
00:55:07,228 --> 00:55:09,095
A bit gruesome for my taste.

860
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,833
- You sure he's the one?
- That's him, all right.

861
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:14,667
I saw him fight at the tourney

862
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:16,669
for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

863
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:20,907
Give the man his silver.

864
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,677
Let us go and my father will
pay you whatever you want.

865
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:26,980
Enough to buy me a new head?

866
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:30,383
<i>If the King in the North</i>
<i>hears I had the Kingslayer</i>

867
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:33,286
and let him go,
he'll be taking it right off.

868
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,455
I'd rather he takes yours.
