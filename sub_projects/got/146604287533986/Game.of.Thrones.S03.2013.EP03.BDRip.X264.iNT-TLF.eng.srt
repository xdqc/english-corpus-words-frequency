1
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,146
<i>If I may, nephew</i>

2
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,748
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

3
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,984
at the Stone Mill
which may have some bearing--

4
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,320
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

5
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,189
And don't call him "nephew."
He is your king.

6
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:19,657
Robb knows
I meant him no disr--

7
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:23,194
You're lucky I'm not your king.

8
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,393
I wouldn't let you wave
your blunders around

9
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:26,932
like a victory flag.

10
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,568
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

11
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,738
scurrying back to Casterly Rock with
his tail between his legs.

12
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,908
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

13
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,576
if he's the only one
winning any battles.

14
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,091
No, there's glory enough
to go around.

15
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,980
It's not about glory.

16
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:44,418
Your instructions were to wait
for him to come to you.

17
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:45,886
I seized an opportunity.

18
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,821
What value was the mill?

19
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,056
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

20
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,424
<i>Is he there now?</i>

21
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,660
Of course not.
We took the fight to him.

22
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,927
He could not withstand us.

23
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,163
I wanted to draw
the Mountain into the west,

24
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:02,401
into our country where
we could surround him and kill him.

25
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,537
I wanted him to chase us,

26
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,040
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

27
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,275
without a strategic thought
in his head.

28
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,312
I could have that head
on a spike by now.

29
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:18,184
Instead, I have a mill.

30
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,588
<i>We took hostages.</i>

31
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:26,325
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.

32
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,862
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

33
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,331
Martyn is 15, I believe.

34
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:38,740
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

35
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:40,708
Have I sued for peace?

36
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:42,243
No.

37
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:43,678
Do you think
he'll sue for peace

38
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:46,815
because we have his father's

39
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,717
brother's
great-grandsons?

40
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:55,890
No.

41
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:57,925
How many men did you lose?

42
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:00,661
208.

43
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,963
But for every man we lost,
the Lannisters--

44
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,933
We need our men more
than Tywin needs his!

45
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,075
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,478
- I didn't know.
- You would have.

47
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:19,748
Right here today at this gathering
if you had been patient.

48
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:23,084
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

49
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,553
You know who isn't?

50
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:29,823
Tywin Lannister.

51
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,274
Intimate.
Lovely table.

52
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:26,110
<i>Better chairs than the old</i>
<i>small council chamber.</i>

53
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:29,580
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

54
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:32,450
What news of Jaime?

55
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:38,722
20,000 unwashed Northerners

56
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,791
have known about
his escape for weeks.

57
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:43,193
<i>Collectively, you control</i>
<i>more spies and informants</i>

58
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:45,128
than the rest
of the world combined.

59
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,064
Do you mean to tell me
that none of you

60
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,200
has any notion of where he is?

61
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:52,203
- We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.

62
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,474
<i>What do we have, then?</i>

63
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,378
Robb Stark and most of his
bannermen are in Riverrun

64
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:03,181
for the funeral of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

65
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:08,319
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

66
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:11,922
which would seem to make
him Lord of Harrenhal,

67
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:14,076
- in practice if not in name.
- <i>Well, let him have it.</i>

68
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,958
The name suits our purposes

69
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:18,995
far more than that
useless pile of rubble.

70
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:22,131
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

71
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,101
For which I am extremely
grateful to you, my lord.

72
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,737
<i>Lady Arryn and I have known</i>
<i>each other since we were children.</i>

73
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,239
She has always been...

74
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:32,808
positively predisposed
toward me.

75
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:36,145
A successful courtship
would make Lord Baelish

76
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,980
acting Lord of the Vale.

77
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,850
Titles do seem to breed titles.

78
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,052
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

79
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:44,854
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold.

80
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,890
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

81
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,759
of people who have
taken up arms against him.

82
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:52,596
Far be it from me
to hinder true love,

83
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,167
<i>but Lord Baelish's absence</i>
<i>would present certain problems.</i>

84
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,102
The royal wedding may end up

85
00:09:59,137 --> 00:10:02,005
being the most expensive
event in living memory.

86
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,175
<i>Summer has ended,</i>
<i>hard days lie ahead.</i>

87
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,046
Not a good time to leave the
crown's finances unattended.

88
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,248
<i>Fully agreed.</i>

89
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:14,385
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

90
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,320
Master of Coin?

91
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:18,989
It would appear to be a position
that best suits your talents.

92
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:20,958
I'm quite good
at spending money,

93
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:22,960
but a lifetime
of outrageous wealth

94
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,696
hasn't taught me much
about managing it.

95
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,366
I have no doubt you will
prove equal to this challenge.

96
00:10:28,401 --> 00:10:30,101
Hear, hear.

97
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,372
<i>♪ He lifted her</i>
<i>high in the air ♪</i>

98
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:35,607
♪ He sniffed and roared
and smelled her there ♪

99
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:37,976
♪ She kicked and wailed,
a maid so fair ♪

100
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:40,578
♪ But he licked the honey
from her hair ♪

101
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:43,348
♪ From there to here,
from here to there ♪

102
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:45,483
♪ All black and brown
and covered with hair ♪

103
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,652
♪ He smelled that girl
in the summer air ♪

104
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,855
♪ The bear, the bear
and the maiden fair... ♪

105
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:53,891
I hope you're pleased.

106
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,393
If you had armed me,
they never would have taken us.

107
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:58,395
You were armed
when we were taken.

108
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:00,097
I was in chains if you recall.

109
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:02,032
Our little match would
have ended quite quick

110
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,000
if my hands weren't bound.

111
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:07,337
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

112
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:10,040
what a brilliant swordsman."

113
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:12,375
You were slower
than I expected.

114
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,144
And more predictable.

115
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:15,745
I've been sitting
in a muddy pen

116
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,581
wrapped in chains
for the past year.

117
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,550
And I'm a woman.
I was still beating you.

118
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:22,019
You were not beating me.

119
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:24,221
Maybe you were as good
as people said...

120
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:26,323
once.

121
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,426
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

122
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,900
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped.

123
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:37,468
More than once.

124
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:40,672
None of these fellows have
ever been with a noblewoman.

125
00:11:42,908 --> 00:11:44,576
You'd be wise not to resist.

126
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,678
- Would I?
- They'll knock your teeth out.

127
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,179
You think I care
about my teeth?

128
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:51,449
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

129
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:56,454
If you fight them,
they will kill you.

130
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:58,189
Do you understand?

131
00:11:58,224 --> 00:12:00,959
I'm the prisoner
of value, not you.

132
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:03,294
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?

133
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:05,530
- What does it matter?
- Close your eyes.

134
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:07,365
Pretend they're Renly.

135
00:12:09,168 --> 00:12:11,402
If you were a woman,
you wouldn't resist?

136
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,737
You'd let them
do what they wanted?

137
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,774
If I was a woman,
I'd make them kill me.

138
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:19,176
But I'm not, thank the gods.

139
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,816
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

140
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:27,751
Doesn't have to look pretty.

141
00:12:27,786 --> 00:12:30,187
It just has to keep
the arrows out of my heart.

142
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,356
Why are you helping him?

143
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,591
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

144
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,227
<i>You're not our prisoner,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

145
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,396
- What am I?
- Our guest.

146
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,498
No one's put any chains on you.

147
00:12:40,532 --> 00:12:42,267
So I can walk away, then?

148
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:45,103
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

149
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:47,405
You're lucky we found you.

150
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:54,879
You think you're good with
that bow, you little twat?

151
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:56,480
Better than anyone
you've ever met.

152
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:58,448
<i>A coward's weapon.</i>

153
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:00,617
<i>I like to fight up close.</i>

154
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:04,088
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

155
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,458
Why?
So you can kiss him?

156
00:13:06,492 --> 00:13:08,593
You remember the last time
you were here?

157
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,164
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

158
00:13:12,232 --> 00:13:14,800
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

159
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,036
and I'd rather not
see you no more.

160
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,442
Watch your head.

161
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:24,877
Off we go.

162
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:28,214
<i>Walk up!</i>

163
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:34,319
What are you doing?
We're about to leave.

164
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:35,820
I'm staying.

165
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,392
You're what?

166
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,694
I baked some brown bread
for the innkeep

167
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:44,563
and she said
she never had better.

168
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:46,465
Told Thoros she's keeping me
as a payment

169
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:47,967
for all the free meals
she's given him.

170
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:50,169
Anyway, it's not me
the Brotherhood wants.

171
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,638
My brother ain't no king.

172
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,306
I'm not a Stark of Winterhell.

173
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:55,741
Winterfell.

174
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,244
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

175
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:04,416
Well, I made you something.

176
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:10,723
What is it?

177
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,992
It's a wolf.

178
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,064
Yes, it is.

179
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,700
That's the tail?

180
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,235
Yeah.

181
00:14:24,871 --> 00:14:27,606
Well, be safe.

182
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,475
Yeah, you, too.

183
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,210
Don't get stabbed.

184
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:34,146
You don't...

185
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,015
burn your fingers.

186
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,494
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

187
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,796
Good-bye, Arry.

188
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,711
Up you go, little lady.

189
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,419
<i>Hey, Hot Pie.</i>

190
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:16,722
It's really good.

191
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,364
A person could
almost be forgiven

192
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:27,599
for forgetting we're at war.

193
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:34,439
It often comforts me to think
that even in war's darkest days,

194
00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:36,308
in most places in the world

195
00:15:36,342 --> 00:15:40,611
absolutely nothing
is happening.

196
00:15:43,082 --> 00:15:44,983
I've missed you, Uncle.

197
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:46,985
Father missed you, too,

198
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,920
from the day you left.

199
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:51,122
Maybe he never said it
in so many words--

200
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:52,758
Maybe?

201
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,060
Your father
was a stubborn old ox.

202
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:56,862
I was surprised when he died.

203
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,665
Didn't think death
had the patience.

204
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:04,604
I'm glad you were with him.

205
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,505
I wish to the gods I had been.

206
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:11,911
Did you make peace in the end?

207
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:14,747
After 30 years of fighting,

208
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:17,183
I don't think he remembered
what started it.

209
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:20,953
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

210
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:23,155
He said it was an old joke

211
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,691
and it was never funny
to begin with.

212
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,729
I told him people had been
calling me Blackfish

213
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:32,632
for so long, they don't
remember my real name.

214
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,972
Every time he would leave
for the capital

215
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:41,741
or fight in a campaign,

216
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:43,909
I'd see him off.

217
00:16:43,944 --> 00:16:47,045
"Wait for me,
little Cat," he'd say.

218
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:50,248
"Wait for me

219
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:53,752
and I'll come back
to you."

220
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:56,321
And I would sit at this window

221
00:16:56,356 --> 00:16:59,091
every day when the sun
came up, waiting.

222
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:05,263
I wonder

223
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:08,032
how many times
did Bran or Rickon

224
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,001
stare across the moors
of Winterfell

225
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:12,203
waiting for me to return.

226
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:15,706
<i>I will never see them again.</i>

227
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:20,878
You mustn't think it.

228
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:23,213
We don't know the truth.

229
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:25,916
They could be in hiding.

230
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:31,723
Robb believes they're alive.

231
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:33,892
And he must go on believing.

232
00:17:33,926 --> 00:17:36,695
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

233
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:40,799
And you must remain
strong for him.

234
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,578
You're Robb Stark's wife.

235
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:56,081
Hold still.

236
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,351
Is it true
what they say about him?

237
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:02,954
I don't know.
What do they say about him?

238
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:05,257
That he can turn
into a wolf at night.

239
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,993
True.

240
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:10,262
And he eats the flesh
of his enemies.

241
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:12,264
True.

242
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,235
You're a Lannister, aren't you?

243
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,469
Martyn Lannister.

244
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:21,639
Martyn Lannister.

245
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:22,940
You've nothing to fear.

246
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:25,109
My husband
doesn't eat children.

247
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,213
Unless it's a full moon.

248
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:32,049
It's not a full moon
tonight, is it?

249
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,851
See?

250
00:18:33,886 --> 00:18:36,121
Nothing to fear.

251
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:56,642
Always the artists.

252
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:18,500
It's only horses.

253
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,134
No men.

254
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:23,872
You said there was dead crows.

255
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,241
There was.

256
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:30,045
How many men were here?

257
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,281
About 300.

258
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,716
And you know
what those men are now?

259
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:41,790
We're all the same to them--
meat for their army.

260
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,727
Do you think anyone got away?

261
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:47,262
<i>It's not impossible.</i>

262
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,664
<i>You don't go far</i>
<i>betting against Mormont.</i>

263
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:52,000
But dead or alive,

264
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:54,169
he took a big gamble
coming north.

265
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:56,270
<i>And he lost.</i>

266
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:58,639
His best fighting men are dead.

267
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:01,876
And whether he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

268
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,878
or a blue-eyed corpse,

269
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,714
he's a long way from home.

270
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:09,116
Tormund.

271
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:11,152
Climb the Wall.

272
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:14,255
Take Orell and 20 good men.

273
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,890
And take this one.

274
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,759
He knows Castle Black's
defenses better than any of us.

275
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:21,195
And if he's useful, good.
If not...

276
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,631
throw him off the Wall.

277
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:26,567
See if crows can fly.

278
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:29,904
We're finally going to war,
old friend?

279
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,506
Hide near Castle Black.

280
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,841
When I give the signal,
hit them in the night.

281
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,577
They've got a big old wall
to hide behind,

282
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,446
but it only guards one side.

283
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:41,649
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.

284
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:43,851
- If you do your job.
- Ah.

285
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:46,054
How will we see your signal?

286
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,790
Send your eagle above
the Wall every night.

287
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:51,593
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

288
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:53,829
the North has ever seen.

289
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,660
Ghost?

290
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:39,609
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

291
00:21:39,644 --> 00:21:41,645
We've come a long way.

292
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:46,417
<i>Smaller flock</i>
<i>than you went north with.</i>

293
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,553
We can talk inside.

294
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:51,689
Oh, can we?

295
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:14,278
<i>They need some water.</i>

296
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:16,481
<i>Tether it and I'll be inside.</i>

297
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,264
<i>Keep your eyes</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

298
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,833
They're not for you.

299
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,335
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

300
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,806
Aye, pig's got value to me.

301
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,709
You should all be kissing
my feet for letting you in.

302
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:50,881
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

303
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:53,249
You are a godly man?

304
00:22:53,283 --> 00:22:56,720
I am.
I got no fear of what's out there.

305
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,755
<i>When the white cold comes,</i>

306
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:02,926
<i>your swords and cloaks</i>
<i>and bloody fires won't help you.</i>

307
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,197
The only ones left will be
those who are right with the gods.

308
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:08,798
The real gods.

309
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:17,073
Go tell her she can
bite down on a rag

310
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:19,776
or she can bite down
on my fist.

311
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:26,283
Women.

312
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,185
That sow right there gave birth

313
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:30,520
<i>to a litter of eight.</i>

314
00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:32,689
Barely a grunt.

315
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:37,060
And she's almost as fat
as this one here.

316
00:23:37,095 --> 00:23:39,663
Now why don't you dine on him?

317
00:23:39,697 --> 00:23:42,332
Carve off what you need
as you go.

318
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:45,501
Well, look at him.
He's a walking feast.

319
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:04,987
<i>Here we are.</i>

320
00:24:05,021 --> 00:24:07,390
<i>Sharpen these for me, would ya?</i>

321
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:26,977
<i>I see the head.</i>
<i>Push.</i>

322
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:29,779
That's it.

323
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:32,149
<i>You're nearly there.</i>

324
00:24:36,521 --> 00:24:38,555
One more push should do it.

325
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,869
What is it?
What is it?

326
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,836
Keep quiet.

327
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:56,903
If you can't ride,
we don't stand a chance.

328
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:58,972
I can ride.

329
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,275
You're sure?

330
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:17,057
Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.

331
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:19,493
<i>Your sister's waiting for you.</i>

332
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:22,228
I'll make you a Lord
of the Iron Islands for this.

333
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:23,423
We're not in the Iron Islands.

334
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:25,999
- Go.
- Come on.

335
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,634
Come on.
Come on.

336
00:26:27,668 --> 00:26:29,602
Come on. Come on.

337
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:35,475
<i>Come on back.</i>

338
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:41,380
<i>You refuse to tell me</i>
<i>where you're going?</i>

339
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:44,516
<i>I don't know yet.</i>
<i>The fires will show me.</i>

340
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,285
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

341
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:49,988
You're abandoning me.

342
00:26:50,022 --> 00:26:52,190
I will never abandon you.

343
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:56,161
You are the Son of Fire.

344
00:26:56,195 --> 00:26:58,730
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.

345
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:00,932
When I return,
you will understand.

346
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:05,537
My enemies think
they've destroyed me.

347
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,608
They're laughing at me

348
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:13,145
the way Renly laughed at me.

349
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:15,747
I want Joffrey dead.

350
00:27:15,782 --> 00:27:18,284
I want Robb Stark dead.

351
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:23,889
Make me another son.

352
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:25,524
I cannot.

353
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,759
Why?

354
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:29,829
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

355
00:27:29,863 --> 00:27:32,732
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.

356
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:39,906
I want you.

357
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:56,492
Your fires burn low, my king.

358
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:03,432
There is another way.
A better way.

359
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:06,034
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

360
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:07,669
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

361
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:09,270
You are.

362
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:11,539
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

363
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,745
You will sit
on the Iron Throne,

364
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,914
but first there must
be sacrifices.

365
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,750
The Lord of Light demands it.

366
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:35,697
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

367
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:38,833
- To whom?
- To any slave who contemplates doing

368
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:41,535
whatever these slaves did.

369
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:44,071
Give me your water.

370
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:47,808
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

371
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:56,083
Here, drink.

372
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,654
<i>Leave this place, Your Grace.</i>

373
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,256
Leave tonight, I beg you.

374
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,791
And what is she
to do for soldiers?

375
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:07,294
<i>We can find sellswords</i>
<i>in Pentos and Myr.</i>

376
00:29:07,362 --> 00:29:10,798
Is it "we" already,
Ser Barristan?

377
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,635
If you want to sit on the throne your
ancestors built, you must win it.

378
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,871
That will mean blood on your
hands before the thing is done.

379
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:20,107
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

380
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,646
How many wars have you
fought in, Ser Barristan?

381
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,914
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

382
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:30,317
where innocents didn't die
by the thousands?

383
00:29:34,989 --> 00:29:38,025
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, khaleesi.

384
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:41,194
You know what I saw?
Butchery.

385
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:43,597
Babies, children, old men.

386
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:46,033
More women raped
than you can count.

387
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:47,667
There's a beast in every man

388
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,671
and it stirs when you put
a sword in his hand.

389
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:53,073
But the Unsullied are not men.

390
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:54,741
They do not rape.

391
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:57,845
They do not put cities to the sword
unless they're ordered to do so.

392
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:02,549
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

393
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,050
Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?

394
00:30:04,085 --> 00:30:07,154
When your brother Rhaegar led
his army into battle at the Trident,

395
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,823
men died for him
because they believed in him,

396
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:11,558
because they loved him,

397
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:14,061
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

398
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:18,632
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

399
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:22,470
I bled beside him.

400
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:26,040
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

401
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,909
and Rhaegar died.

402
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:31,480
Did you know him well,
Ser Barristan?

403
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:36,051
I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.

404
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,287
I wish I had known him.

405
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:40,355
But he was not the last dragon.

406
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,347
All?

407
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:54,968
Did this one's ears
mishear, Your Grace?

408
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:57,741
They did not.
I want to buy them all.

409
00:30:57,775 --> 00:30:59,943
_

410
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,253
_

411
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:06,095
_

412
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:11,688
_

413
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:16,026
There are 8,000 Unsullied
in Astapor.

414
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,794
Is this what you mean by all?

415
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:19,729
Yes. 8,000.

416
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,065
<i>And the ones</i>
<i>still in training as well.</i>

417
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:27,097
_

418
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:30,328
_

419
00:31:31,476 --> 00:31:34,845
Master Greizhen says they
cannot sell half-trained boys.

420
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:37,180
<i>If they fail</i>
<i>on the battlefield,</i>

421
00:31:37,215 --> 00:31:39,449
they will bring shame
upon all of Astapor.

422
00:31:39,483 --> 00:31:41,351
I will have them all
or take none.

423
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:42,576
Many will fall in battle.

424
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,653
I'll need the boys to pick
up the swords they drop.

425
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:49,507
_

426
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:52,516
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

427
00:31:52,636 --> 00:31:55,947
_

428
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:59,636
Your ship will buy you
100 Unsullied.

429
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:04,508
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

430
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:09,438
<i>The gold you have left</i>
<i>is worth 10.</i>

431
00:32:10,215 --> 00:32:12,749
But good Master Kraznys
will give you 20.

432
00:32:14,886 --> 00:32:17,320
The Dothraki
you have with you--

433
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:21,144
_

434
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,462
The Dothraki you have are not
worth what they cost to feed,

435
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:28,031
<i>but Master Kraznys will give</i>
<i>you three Unsullied</i>

436
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:29,633
<i>for all of them.</i>

437
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:30,815
_

438
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:33,770
Master Kraznys asks
how you propose to pay

439
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:39,410
for the remaining
7,877 Unsullied.

440
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:47,351
I have dragons.
I'll give you one.

441
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:54,125
You will win the throne
with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

442
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,860
Khaleesi, please.

443
00:33:05,804 --> 00:33:07,504
Three dragons.

444
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:08,806
- One.
- Two.

445
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:10,174
One.

446
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:22,919
<i>They want the biggest one.</i>

447
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:25,388
- Done.
- Done.

448
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,762
I'll take you as well, now.

449
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:35,732
You'll be Master
Kraznys' gift to me.

450
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,901
A token of a bargain
well struck.

451
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:43,029
_

452
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:48,492
_

453
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:51,747
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth
more than any army.

454
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:54,050
Aegon Targaryen proved that.

455
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,653
You're both here to advise me.

456
00:33:57,688 --> 00:33:59,674
I value your advice,
but if you ever question me

457
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:01,224
in front of strangers again,

458
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:03,759
you'll be advising
someone else.

459
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:06,095
Is that understood?

460
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:10,566
<i>Do you have a name?</i>

461
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,235
This one's name
is Missandei, Your Grace.

462
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,471
Do you have a family?
A mother and a father

463
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:17,506
you'd return to
if you had the choice?

464
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,843
No, Your Grace.
No family living.

465
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:24,013
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

466
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:26,615
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offense.

467
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,019
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment
were taken there for less.

468
00:34:30,053 --> 00:34:32,774
I offered water to one of the slaves
dying on the Walk of Punishment.

469
00:34:32,789 --> 00:34:36,058
Do you know what he said to me?
"Let me die."

470
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,961
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

471
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,630
Is it true what
Master Kraznys told me

472
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,800
about the Unsullied?
About their obedience?

473
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:47,369
All questions have been
taken from them.

474
00:34:47,403 --> 00:34:49,270
They obey, that is all.

475
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:52,073
<i>Once they are yours,</i>
<i>they are yours.</i>

476
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:54,174
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

477
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:57,678
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

478
00:34:57,712 --> 00:35:01,848
<i>You may go hungry.</i>
<i>You may fall sick.</i>

479
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:04,017
You may be killed.

480
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:05,753
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

481
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:09,356
Yes, all men must die.

482
00:35:10,392 --> 00:35:12,526
But we are not men.

483
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:26,006
<i>A surprising place to keep</i>
<i>the royal ledgers.</i>

484
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,142
<i>I'm surprised you're surprised.</i>

485
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:33,180
This is the safest place
in the city.

486
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,116
Not for bastards.

487
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,452
That's all of them, my lord.

488
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:40,589
<i>Thank you, my dear.</i>
<i>Pod.</i>

489
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,792
Pod.
Take them outside.

490
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:46,528
- I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.

491
00:35:57,306 --> 00:36:00,576
I hear you owe that boy
a significant debt.

492
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,411
Only my life.

493
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:04,379
Not all that significant,
I'm afraid.

494
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:06,448
You should have him knighted.

495
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:09,651
If only the Master of Coin
had such power.

496
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:12,754
If only.

497
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,892
I owe you a significant debt.

498
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:19,294
Our redheaded friend.

499
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,096
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

500
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,098
Oh, that.

501
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:27,301
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.

502
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,103
Apparently, Her Grace believed

503
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:33,174
that you two had some sort
of special relationship.

504
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:36,144
We don't.
I did fuck her once.

505
00:36:36,178 --> 00:36:38,212
- I know.
- But we don't.

506
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:39,881
I know.

507
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:41,616
But how would the queen
get that idea?

508
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,419
Why don't you ask her?

509
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:49,891
Any advice for me
on my new position?

510
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:52,861
Keep a low profile.

511
00:36:52,895 --> 00:36:56,164
If I had a gold dragon

512
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:59,267
for every time I heard
that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

513
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,169
Well, you are richer than I am.

514
00:37:01,204 --> 00:37:03,238
Good point.

515
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:06,608
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.

516
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:10,112
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

517
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,681
Trivial even.

518
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:13,483
You want a real challenge?

519
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:14,918
Try whores.

520
00:37:14,952 --> 00:37:17,521
I've tried quite a few.

521
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:20,023
Well, lots of work to do.

522
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:22,793
Enjoy the Eyrie.

523
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:24,828
Come on, I'm here later.

524
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:26,697
Come on.

525
00:37:30,268 --> 00:37:31,769
Tonight, then.

526
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:35,806
Looks like dull reading.

527
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,108
You think all reading
is dull reading.

528
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:41,011
It's an opinion I share with
some of the finest men I know.

529
00:37:41,045 --> 00:37:43,645
The secret history of the Seven
Kingdoms is written in these pages.

530
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:46,284
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

531
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:47,885
to hide what he's really up to.

532
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,954
Unless he made it all up, yes.

533
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:52,390
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.

534
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:54,692
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

535
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:58,096
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

536
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,031
I finally found
a suitable reward

537
00:38:00,066 --> 00:38:02,367
for the services you've
provided over and above

538
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:03,969
<i>what might be</i>
<i>considered reasonable.</i>

539
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:06,405
Tell me, Pod,

540
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:09,208
have you ever been
with a woman?

541
00:38:09,242 --> 00:38:11,777
- No, my lord.
- Wonderful.

542
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:17,216
Genna specializes
in first-timers.

543
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,985
She's not bad with
second-timers, either.

544
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,987
Uh, my lord...

545
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:24,457
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

546
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,692
through my would-be killer's face,
wouldn't you say?

547
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:31,598
Now, as it happens,

548
00:38:31,632 --> 00:38:34,134
Marei...

549
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:37,437
is quite the spear
handler herself.

550
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:41,008
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

551
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:43,778
as the battle raged
all around me.

552
00:38:43,812 --> 00:38:45,647
He's handsome.

553
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:48,984
You didn't tell me
he was handsome.

554
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,923
Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis

555
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,192
in certain circles.

556
00:38:56,227 --> 00:38:58,828
<i>One of four women in the world</i>

557
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:02,599
who can perform a proper
Meereenese Knot.

558
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:05,702
My lord, I don't even...

559
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,471
<i>She's here to thank you</i>

560
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:10,240
<i>for being a thoroughly</i>
<i>respectful fellow</i>

561
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:13,077
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

562
00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:18,282
Be back in time for my supper.

563
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,488
Pace yourself, lad.

564
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:27,957
For years I've heard
that Littlefinger

565
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,360
is a magician.

566
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:33,363
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together

567
00:39:33,397 --> 00:39:36,032
and, poof, mountains of gold.

568
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,468
Let me guess.
He's not a magician.

569
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,437
No.

570
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,875
- He's stealing it?
- Worse, he's borrowing it.

571
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:47,511
What's wrong with that?

572
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:51,214
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

573
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:53,583
The crown owes millions
to my father.

574
00:39:53,618 --> 00:39:55,952
Seeing as it's his grandson's
ass on the throne,

575
00:39:55,987 --> 00:39:57,954
I imagine he'll forgive
that debt.

576
00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:00,289
Forgive a debt, my father?

577
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:02,758
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

578
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:04,727
I've never borrowed
money before.

579
00:40:04,762 --> 00:40:07,129
I'm not clear on the rules.

580
00:40:07,164 --> 00:40:08,598
Well...

581
00:40:08,632 --> 00:40:10,833
<i>Ahem!</i>

582
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,171
The basic principle is

583
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,706
I lend you money,

584
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:19,276
and after an agreed upon
period of time,

585
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,912
you return it with interest.

586
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:23,413
And what if I don't?

587
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,515
Well, you have to.

588
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:26,882
But what if I don't?

589
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:29,251
This is why
I don't lend you money.

590
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:32,788
Anyway, it's not my father
I'm worried about.

591
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:34,790
It's the Iron Bank of Braavos.

592
00:40:34,824 --> 00:40:36,525
We owe them tens of millions.

593
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,062
If we fail to repay these loans,
the bank will fund our enemies.

594
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:44,232
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

595
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,804
Ah, the return
of the conquering hero.

596
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:51,307
Does he have a little
jaunt in his step?

597
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:52,975
The lad's practically skipping.

598
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:54,677
You were gone a long time.

599
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:56,512
I trust you got
your money's worth.

600
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:58,180
Or should I say
my money's worth?

601
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:02,951
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.

602
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:04,720
This is more than
I give you in a year.

603
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,723
He's a squire.
You don't pay him.

604
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,258
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

605
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:12,193
They wouldn't take it, my lord.

606
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:15,696
Maybe they're trying
to curry some favor

607
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:17,098
<i>with the new Master of Coin.</i>

608
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:19,233
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

609
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:21,802
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

610
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:23,537
What did you tell them?

611
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:25,138
I didn't tell them anything.

612
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:28,242
- What did you do to them?
- Lots of things.

613
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:30,210
And they seemed
to like these things?

614
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:31,779
Yes, my lord.

615
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:33,514
<i>Of course</i>
<i>they seemed to like it.</i>

616
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:35,049
They're paid
to seem to like it.

617
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:37,318
Only they weren't paid.

618
00:41:37,352 --> 00:41:40,288
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

619
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:42,923
they gave him
the time for free?

620
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,325
Is that what you're telling us?

621
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,164
Sit down, Podrick.

622
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:59,205
We're going to need details.

623
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,642
Copious details.

624
00:42:42,116 --> 00:42:44,918
Come on!
Come on!

625
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:48,422
Come on!

626
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:50,491
Come on.

627
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,495
Ha! Ha!

628
00:44:16,547 --> 00:44:18,982
You know how we deal
with runaways here, do you?

629
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:27,892
Take off his pants.

630
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:30,329
No! No!

631
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:31,997
No, no, no!

632
00:44:32,032 --> 00:44:34,132
I'm gonna fuck you
into the dirt.

633
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:36,668
No, please!
No, no, no!

634
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:38,269
No, don't!

635
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,573
<i>No, please!</i>

636
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:45,209
<i>No! No!</i>

637
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,709
You little bastard.

638
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:28,587
Come, my lord.

639
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,593
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

640
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:02,720
I'll take the big bitch first.

641
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:06,123
When she's good and wet,
you lot can finish her off.

642
00:46:06,157 --> 00:46:08,625
<i>My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.</i>

643
00:46:08,659 --> 00:46:10,994
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me

644
00:46:11,028 --> 00:46:13,697
to deliver Ser Jaime
to King's Landing.

645
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:15,665
Catelyn Stark's
a treasonous cunt.

646
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:17,667
<i>Orders were to take</i>
<i>the Kingslayer alive.</i>

647
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:19,869
Nobody said shit about you.

648
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,976
You're only making it worse.

649
00:46:31,115 --> 00:46:33,750
<i>Take her over there</i>
<i>where it's dark.</i>

650
00:46:33,784 --> 00:46:35,185
I'd like a little privacy.

651
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,222
Come on!

652
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:52,069
You know who she is, don't you?

653
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:58,009
A big dumb bitch
from who cares where.

654
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:02,146
Never been with
a woman that big.

655
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:04,949
<i>She's Brienne of Tarth.</i>

656
00:47:04,984 --> 00:47:07,686
Her father
is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

657
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,321
Heard of Tarth?

658
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:12,190
<i>I'm gonna cut your throat!</i>

659
00:47:12,225 --> 00:47:15,226
They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?

660
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:18,263
Every sapphire in Westeros

661
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:19,831
was mined on Tarth.

662
00:47:19,865 --> 00:47:23,335
<i>Sapphires are gemstones.</i>

663
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,671
- <i>The blue ones.</i>
- I know what they are.

664
00:47:26,706 --> 00:47:30,442
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

665
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:33,178
in sapphires
if she's returned to him.

666
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:36,448
<i>But only if she's alive,</i>

667
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:39,384
her honor unbesmirched.

668
00:47:49,795 --> 00:47:51,829
Bring her back here.

669
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:53,264
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

670
00:47:53,298 --> 00:47:55,800
- <i>Get up.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

671
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:58,470
<i>Come on, on your feet.</i>

672
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:01,906
<i>Unbesmirched.</i>

673
00:48:03,408 --> 00:48:05,643
Not defiled.

674
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:08,445
Fancy word for a fancy man.

675
00:48:09,547 --> 00:48:12,182
I hated to read as a child,

676
00:48:12,216 --> 00:48:15,018
<i>but my father forced me</i>
<i>to study the books every morning</i>

677
00:48:15,052 --> 00:48:18,222
<i>before I could practice</i>
<i>with sword or horse.</i>

678
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:21,625
Two hours every day holed up in
the maester's chambers.

679
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:25,095
I learned a lot of fancy words.

680
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:27,331
I bet you did.

681
00:48:35,474 --> 00:48:37,508
Your father,

682
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:40,411
he'd pay your weight
in gold to get you back?

683
00:48:41,913 --> 00:48:44,849
You'll be a rich man
till the end of your days.

684
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:46,751
<i>And your sons will be rich men</i>

685
00:48:46,785 --> 00:48:49,119
<i>and their sons after them.</i>

686
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:51,456
Lands, titles--

687
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,758
you'll have them all.

688
00:48:55,427 --> 00:48:58,563
The North can't win this war.

689
00:48:58,597 --> 00:49:01,165
You're a smart man.
You understand that.

690
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,900
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.

691
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:05,003
Aye, you have both.

692
00:49:06,538 --> 00:49:09,474
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause

693
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:11,343
is admirable.

694
00:49:11,377 --> 00:49:14,046
Fighting for a winning cause

695
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,581
is far more rewarding.

696
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:19,017
Hard to argue with that.

697
00:49:22,289 --> 00:49:25,258
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

698
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:29,496
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree.

699
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,932
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

700
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:35,769
but if I could sleep
lying down,

701
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:37,605
my back would thank you for it.

702
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:39,674
I'm not as young

703
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:42,376
and resilient as I was once.

704
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:44,412
None of us are.

705
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:48,917
<i>Unchain Ser Jaime</i>
<i>from the tree.</i>

706
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:51,386
<i>Come on, men.</i>

707
00:49:56,793 --> 00:50:00,128
Suppose you'll be wanting
something to eat.

708
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,030
I'm famished, actually.

709
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,167
<i>I think we've got a spare</i>
<i>partridge on the fire.</i>

710
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,004
Well, I do like partridge.

711
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:17,414
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

712
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:23,353
Will this work
as a table, my lord?

713
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:25,255
Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do nic--

714
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,391
ah!

715
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:29,593
On the stump.

716
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:38,902
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

717
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:44,006
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape

718
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,142
and lick your boots.

719
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,677
- My father--
- And if you get in any trouble,

720
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,580
all you've got to do
is say "my father"

721
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:54,649
and that's it,
all your troubles are gone.

722
00:50:56,251 --> 00:50:59,154
- Don't.
- Have you got something to say?

723
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:06,460
Careful. You don't want to say
the wrong thing.

724
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:12,500
You're nothing
without your daddy,

725
00:51:12,534 --> 00:51:15,970
and your daddy ain't here.

726
00:51:16,004 --> 00:51:18,439
Never forget that.

727
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,464
Here, this should
help you remember.
