1
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,802
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

2
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,505
No.

3
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,574
It's dangerous.

4
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,178
If we take Tywin's
castle from him,

5
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:21,481
the lords of Westeros will
realize he's not invincible.

6
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:22,983
Take his home,

7
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:25,118
take his gold,
take his power.

8
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:27,254
Why are you telling me?

9
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,792
You begged me
not to send Theon

10
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:36,730
to negotiate with his father
and I ignored your advice.

11
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,068
Now Winterfell is burnt
to the ground,

12
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:43,270
the North is overrun
with ironborn,

13
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:45,372
and Bran and Rickon
are gone.

14
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,776
So Casterly Rock...

15
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:56,082
I'm asking your advice.

16
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:04,357
We have enough men?

17
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,197
If Walder Frey cooperates.

18
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,200
If Walder Frey
cooperates.

19
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,408
If reinforcements arrive
from King's Landing

20
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:23,810
<i>before we take</i>
<i>the castle...</i>

21
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:29,015
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

22
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:36,788
We'll lose the war and die
the way Father died.

23
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,823
Or worse.

24
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:47,665
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

25
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:20,464
<i>My honored guests...</i>

26
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,535
be welcome
within my walls

27
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,370
and at my table.

28
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:31,075
<i>I extend to you</i>
<i>my hospitality</i>

29
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,946
and protection
in the light of the Seven.

30
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,616
We thank you for your
hospitality, my lord.

31
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:44,456
I have come to make
my apologies, my lord,

32
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,358
and to beg
your forgiveness.

33
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:49,761
Don't beg my forgiveness,
Your Grace.

34
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:54,299
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.

35
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:09,481
<i>One of them was supposed</i>
<i>to be queen.</i>

36
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:11,182
Now none of them are.

37
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:15,753
This is Arwyen
my daughter.

38
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:20,391
<i>My daughter Walda,</i>
<i>my daughter Derwa,</i>

39
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:22,993
<i>my daughter Waldra.</i>

40
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:29,733
My eldest granddaughters

41
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:33,069
<i>Ginia and Neila.</i>

42
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:39,143
<i>Serra and Sarra,</i>
<i>granddaughters, twins.</i>

43
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:40,744
You could have
had either.

44
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:44,048
<i>Could have had both</i>
<i>for all I care.</i>

45
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,516
My granddaughter
Marianne.

46
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,419
<i>My granddaughter Freya.</i>

47
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:53,256
My granddaughter...

48
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,891
Wertha.

49
00:05:57,127 --> 00:06:00,195
<i>Waldra.</i>

50
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:02,231
Waldina.

51
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:05,067
- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

52
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:08,871
And here's my youngest
daughter Shirei,

53
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:11,842
<i>though she hasn't</i>
<i>bled yet.</i>

54
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:14,745
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

55
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,748
My ladies.

56
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:21,285
All men should keep their
word, kings most of all.

57
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:25,856
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

58
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:28,058
<i>The fault</i>
<i>is not with you.</i>

59
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:31,495
<i>Any man would be lucky</i>
<i>to have any one of you.</i>

60
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,431
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>not to slight you,</i>

61
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:36,300
but because I loved another.

62
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,235
<i>I know these words</i>
<i>cannot set right</i>

63
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,303
<i>the wrong I have done</i>
<i>to you and your house.</i>

64
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:43,640
I beg your forgiveness

65
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:46,776
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

66
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:49,646
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

67
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,614
may once again be friends.

68
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:00,824
<i>Very good.</i>

69
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,961
There she is.

70
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:07,130
<i>Come closer.</i>

71
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:09,131
Let me have a look at you.

72
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:18,273
Still can't see you.

73
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,442
Old eyes.

74
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,327
Love.

75
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:41,232
<i>That's what the Starks</i>
<i>of Winterfell call it, eh?</i>

76
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:45,369
Very honorable.

77
00:07:45,403 --> 00:07:47,671
I call it a pretty face.

78
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:50,775
Mmm, very pretty.

79
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,979
Prettier than this lot,
that's for sure.

80
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,583
Very shapely as well.

81
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:03,288
<i>Oh, you try to hide her</i>
<i>under that dress.</i>

82
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,290
If you wanted to hide her,

83
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:07,693
you shouldn't have brought her
here in the first place.

84
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,368
I can always see

85
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:18,237
what's going on
beneath a dress.

86
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:21,174
<i>Been at this a long time.</i>

87
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:25,077
<i>I bet when you take</i>
<i>that dress off,</i>

88
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,813
everything stays
right where it is.

89
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,647
Doesn't drop an inch.

90
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:35,185
Your king says he betrayed
me for love.

91
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,955
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits

92
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:40,591
and a tight fit.

93
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,293
And I can respect that.

94
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:48,331
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

95
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:51,800
to get into that
without a second thought.

96
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:58,607
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

97
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,709
We'll set up
tents outside

98
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:03,112
with food and ale
for the rest of your men.

99
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,314
Thank you, my lord.

100
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,153
Well, let's get ready.

101
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:12,222
The wine will flow red

102
00:09:12,256 --> 00:09:15,726
<i>and the music</i>
<i>will play loud</i>

103
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,964
and we'll put
this mess behind us.

104
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,674
Where?

105
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,309
There.

106
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,286
There.
It's a back gate.

107
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,222
My men use it when they
visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

108
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:46,958
Your men,
but not you?

109
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:48,626
<i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in slaves.</i>

110
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,929
A man cannot make love
to property.

111
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,834
This is where
we enter the city.

112
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,336
Very few guards.
They know me.

113
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,871
They let me inside--

114
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:01,140
We're not gonna sneak
an army through a back gate.

115
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:04,144
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men

116
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,547
and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,

117
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:09,682
and open the front gates.

118
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:11,317
Then comes the army.

119
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,986
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

120
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,924
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,

121
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,426
cutting the head
off our army.

122
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:22,196
<i>The masters of Yunkai</i>
<i>will pay you your fee</i>

123
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,598
and you won't have
to split it three ways

124
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:25,633
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

125
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,136
You have
a very suspicious mind.

126
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,239
In my experience, only dishonest
people think this way.

127
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:35,610
You command the Unsullied.

128
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:38,013
<i>What do you think?</i>

129
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:51,993
You leave tonight.

130
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,128
Very good.

131
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:55,963
We'll prepare.

132
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,669
Ser Jorah.

133
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,373
You can use
an extra sword.

134
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:08,909
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan.

135
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:10,978
Your place
is by the queen.

136
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:13,447
If we are truly
her loyal servants,

137
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:15,516
we'll do whatever
needs to be done

138
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,687
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

139
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:25,260
We're west
of Castle Black,

140
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,295
but the Nightfort's
closest to us.

141
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:30,465
It was the first
castle on the Wall.

142
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:33,901
The Watch abandoned it during
the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

143
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:37,605
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.

144
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,974
Other than
Castle Black itself,

145
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:42,476
the Nightfort's
the perfect castle for us.

146
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:45,980
It's got a secret
sally port,

147
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:48,616
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

148
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,386
No one's used it
in centuries most likely.

149
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,088
It leads through the Wall

150
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,023
right down
into the Nightfort,

151
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:58,925
if one knows
how to find it,

152
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,861
which, it just
so happens, I do.

153
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,201
How do you know
all that?

154
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,172
I read about it
in a very old book.

155
00:12:18,678 --> 00:12:20,245
You know all that

156
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,214
from staring
at marks on paper?

157
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:26,284
Yes.

158
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:29,087
You're like a wizard.

159
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,273
Our father
used to tell us

160
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,678
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

161
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:53,214
Here we are.

162
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:55,584
Alive.

163
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,602
Remember what happens
to children who run.

164
00:13:14,636 --> 00:13:17,472
I'm your father
and I'll do the talking.

165
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:29,718
The roads have gone
right to hell, haven't they?

166
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:31,887
Cracked three spokes
this morning.

167
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,923
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.

168
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,891
Oh!

169
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:38,093
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins

170
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:40,729
in time for the wedding.

171
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,265
Many thanks.

172
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,002
Don't!

173
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:48,337
Don't kill him.

174
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,539
Dead rats don't squeak.

175
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,241
You're so dangerous,
aren't you?

176
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,309
Saying scary things
to little girls.

177
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:57,112
Killing little boys
and old people.

178
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:58,580
A real hard man you are.

179
00:13:58,614 --> 00:14:00,582
More than anyone
you know.

180
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:03,351
You're wrong.
I know a killer.

181
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:06,021
- A real killer.
- That so?

182
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,656
You'd be like
a kitten to him.

183
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,025
He'd kill you
with his little finger.

184
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,160
That him?

185
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,563
- No.
- Good.

186
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:18,533
Don't kill him.

187
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,835
Please.

188
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:23,004
Please don't.

189
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,708
You're very kind.

190
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,710
Someday it'll
get you killed.

191
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:48,896
Where are we?

192
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:51,131
The Gift, I think.

193
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,800
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land

194
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,902
<i>south of the Wall</i>
<i>to the Night's Watch</i>

195
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,872
for their sustenance
and support.

196
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,175
Maester Luwin
taught me that.

197
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:04,246
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

198
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,983
It's good land
and there's no war up here.

199
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,518
Why leave?

200
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:11,253
Wildlings.

201
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:13,021
Sorry.

202
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:15,757
But they come over
the Wall and raid,

203
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:17,625
steal, carry off women.

204
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,860
Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup

205
00:15:19,895 --> 00:15:21,962
and make you drink
your own blood from it.

206
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,333
That's what Old Nan said.

207
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,035
There's a storm coming.

208
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,705
I don't see any--

209
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,910
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

210
00:15:40,181 --> 00:15:42,516
We can drink some blood
while we wait.

211
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,684
I don't need much.

212
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,933
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,069
What's one old man
doing with eight horses?

214
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:03,970
He breeds them
for the Watch.

215
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,973
How's he keep folks
from stealing them?

216
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,342
The Watch protects him.

217
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:10,611
Not today they don't.

218
00:16:10,646 --> 00:16:13,315
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

219
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,551
<i>- And proper steel.</i>
- Let's carve him up.

220
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:17,953
We just take
the horses and go.

221
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:20,656
The old man's no threat.

222
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,125
I keep telling you.

223
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:25,294
He's an old man.

224
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:27,796
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

225
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,344
than coughing up your last with
no one but your horses to hear.

226
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:35,170
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

227
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,073
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

228
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:39,942
I hope so.

229
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,912
Killing crows
in their castle is tough.

230
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:44,881
Killing them out here
in the open,

231
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:46,616
that's what we do.

232
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,384
Spread out.

233
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:50,987
Surround the hut
and move in.

234
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:34,997
Ygritte!

235
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,568
<i>Clear the barn!</i>

236
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:20,141
No one's going to believe you're a
hog farmer if you eat them all.

237
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,477
Best part of the animal.

238
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:29,385
Don't worry.
They're still there.

239
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:32,222
I know
they're still there.

240
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,990
You check
every five minutes

241
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:36,592
like you're afraid
they're gonna move.

242
00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:38,394
I'm not afraid.

243
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,663
Of course you are.

244
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:42,999
You're almost there

245
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,635
and you're afraid
you won't make it.

246
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:49,072
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

247
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:52,543
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

248
00:18:52,577 --> 00:18:55,479
<i>I know fear</i>
<i>when I see it.</i>

249
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:57,381
Seen it a lot.

250
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:01,218
I knew fear
when I saw it in you.

251
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,490
You're afraid of fire.

252
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:07,259
When Beric's sword
went up in flames,

253
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:09,127
you looked like
a scared little girl.

254
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:15,100
And I know why, too.

255
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,405
<i>I heard what</i>
<i>your brother did to you.</i>

256
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,841
Pressed your face
to the fire

257
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:24,477
like you're a nice
juicy mutton chop.

258
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:30,450
That give you some ideas?

259
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,956
Might do.

260
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,325
Go ahead, then.

261
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,727
You might get away.

262
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,297
Might even make it
there on your own.

263
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,600
They're just over
the river.

264
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,769
The closest you've
been to family

265
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,838
since Ilyn Payne
snipped your daddy's neck.

266
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:58,278
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

267
00:19:58,312 --> 00:19:59,946
and out the back
of your skull.

268
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,105
How are we going
to get past the Wall?

269
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,074
My uncle said
it's 700 feet high.

270
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:36,981
How did you get past it?

271
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:43,754
Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.

272
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,990
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

273
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,159
Some climb
straight up the ice.

274
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:52,495
Even Hodor's not strong enough to
climb the Wall with me on his back.

275
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:55,732
Hodor.

276
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,301
19 castles guard the Wall.

277
00:20:58,336 --> 00:21:01,705
- Only three are still manned.
- Hodor!

278
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,974
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

279
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:06,243
My uncle said the gates were
sealed with ice and stone

280
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:07,711
when the castles
were deserted.

281
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:11,048
Well, we'll have
to open them up again.

282
00:21:12,651 --> 00:21:15,386
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
<i>- There's a rider out there.</i>

283
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,623
Just one?

284
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:20,425
<i>- There's more.</i>
- Hodor!

285
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,294
Shh. Shh.

286
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:26,064
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

287
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:28,466
I yield.

288
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:30,168
- <i>I yield.</i>
- Wildlings.

289
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,776
Where's Shaggydog
and Summer?

290
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,811
Hunting.

291
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:40,847
Hodor!

292
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,182
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

293
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,217
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...

294
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:47,420
- Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor!

295
00:21:47,454 --> 00:21:50,356
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

296
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:51,724
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

297
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,926
<i>Hodor, be quiet.</i>

298
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:57,597
- Ah! Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

299
00:21:57,665 --> 00:22:00,633
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

300
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:24,590
What did you do?

301
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:27,359
Nothing.

302
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:29,328
I don't know.

303
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:35,034
What's that?

304
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:38,538
That's a horse dying.

305
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:51,183
<i>Bring them over here.</i>

306
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:54,386
<i>That was the last of them.</i>
<i>The rest are dead.</i>

307
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,654
<i>I heard shouting up there.</i>

308
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:58,823
Thunder.

309
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:01,425
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

310
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,594
Maybe it's ghosts.

311
00:23:14,505 --> 00:23:16,840
That won't
help you, grandpa.

312
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,879
Where you riding?

313
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:24,914
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

314
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,684
No, it doesn't
matter now.

315
00:23:29,387 --> 00:23:32,789
Cut his throat or he'll
tell the crows we're here.

316
00:23:38,696 --> 00:23:40,430
You understand.

317
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:42,432
Let me stand at least.

318
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,869
<i>Let me go</i>
<i>with a bit of dignity.</i>

319
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:52,609
Make the crow kill him.

320
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:59,550
You're one of us now.
Prove it.

321
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:06,358
The wolves are out there.

322
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:10,996
I can't do it by choice.

323
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:15,068
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.

324
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:17,204
You're a warg, Bran.

325
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:19,306
It's in your blood.

326
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,808
I can't.

327
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,743
You just did with him.

328
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:24,779
A wolf is nothing
compared to that.

329
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:34,221
She looks sharp.

330
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:45,901
Do it.

331
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,370
Do it.

332
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,539
I told you.
He's still one of them.

333
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,309
Go on, boy.

334
00:24:58,213 --> 00:24:59,513
Go on!

335
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,090
He's a crow.

336
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:12,058
<i>He'll always be a crow.</i>

337
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,460
And here's his crow wife
guarding him.

338
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:17,697
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

339
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:23,002
Kill him.

340
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:40,320
- He's one of them.
- No!

341
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:41,854
Do you hear me?

342
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:51,164
You're not gonna die
for one of them.

343
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,469
Do it.

344
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:57,337
They'll find us
if you don't.

345
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:29,005
You were right
the whole time.

346
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,564
Hyah!

347
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:18,253
<i>When you hear a songbird's</i>
<i>whistle, you come.</i>

348
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:22,057
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

349
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:30,031
Daario Naharis.

350
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,294
<i>That one was quick.</i>

351
00:28:03,064 --> 00:28:05,098
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

352
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:08,001
The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

353
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:55,918
That's what you call
a few guards?

354
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:22,312
Come on!
What do you got, huh?

355
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:39,087
Lord Edmure...

356
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,025
I hope I'm not
a disappointment to you.

357
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:54,037
You're a delight
to me, my lady.

358
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:57,341
You may now cloak
the bride

359
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,443
and bring her under
your protection.

360
00:31:28,507 --> 00:31:30,107
In the sight of the Seven,

361
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:33,811
I hereby seal
these two souls,

362
00:31:33,846 --> 00:31:37,448
binding them as one
for eternity.

363
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:40,418
<i>Look upon each other</i>
<i>and say the words.</i>

364
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,256
Father, Smith,

365
00:31:45,324 --> 00:31:47,658
Warrior, Mother,

366
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:50,729
Maiden, Crone,
Stranger...

367
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:52,864
- I am hers...
- I am his...

368
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:55,033
- <i>and she is mine...</i>
- <i>and he is mine...</i>

369
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:59,071
<i>...from this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.</i>

370
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:06,646
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.

371
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:13,618
You were right.

372
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:16,187
I can get inside Summer's
mind whenever I want.

373
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:18,422
Of course you can.

374
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:21,024
North of the Wall
there are wildlings

375
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,060
who can control
all sorts of animals.

376
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,429
<i>But you did a lot</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

377
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:31,334
You got inside
Hodor's mind.

378
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,203
They can't do that
north of the Wall?

379
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,642
No one can do that...

380
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:39,777
<i>anywhere.</i>

381
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:49,086
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes,

382
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,787
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

383
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,589
He was with the wildlings.

384
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:54,658
They tried to kill him,
but he got away.

385
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:56,326
<i>He'll be heading back</i>
<i>to Castle Black, then.</i>

386
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,195
That's where we should go.

387
00:32:58,229 --> 00:33:00,597
For all we know, Castle
Black's already under attack.

388
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:03,433
- If this many wildlings got through--
- I already told you.

389
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:05,469
I'm not going
north of the Wall.

390
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:08,472
Everything Jojen
told me is true.

391
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:12,676
You saw what I did
to Hodor.

392
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,678
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>the three-eyed raven.</i>

393
00:33:14,712 --> 00:33:16,280
Listen to me,
little lord.

394
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:17,547
Don't worry.

395
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:20,684
I'm not asking you
to come with me.

396
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:24,388
It won't be safe
for Rickon.

397
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:27,492
Me?
I'm coming with you.

398
00:33:27,526 --> 00:33:30,028
No.

399
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:32,697
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

400
00:33:32,732 --> 00:33:35,934
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

401
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:37,703
I'm coming with you.

402
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:39,605
I'm your brother.

403
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,941
I have to protect you.

404
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:47,179
Right now I have
to protect you.

405
00:33:47,214 --> 00:33:50,349
Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the Wall.

406
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:52,752
If something
happens to us,

407
00:33:52,786 --> 00:33:54,854
you're the heir
to Winterfell.

408
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,092
Would you know how
to find the Last Hearth?

409
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:02,229
You southerners build your big
castles and you never move.

410
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:03,897
You're easy to find.

411
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:06,667
We're not southerners.

412
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:09,770
And I don't want
to leave you.

413
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:12,606
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.

414
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:17,678
You and me, we're gonna
have some adventures.

415
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:20,081
You don't have to do
any of this.

416
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:22,883
Your family
took me in

417
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,253
and was good to me when
they had no cause to be.

418
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:27,622
<i>Shh.</i>

419
00:34:27,656 --> 00:34:29,924
We'll be fine,
you and me.

420
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,193
The Umbers
are great warriors.

421
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:34,862
Even I heard
about them growing up.

422
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:37,265
They'll teach you
how to swing a sword.

423
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:40,835
I know how
to swing a sword.

424
00:34:47,742 --> 00:34:50,511
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.

425
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:52,413
I learned to walk
in darkness.

426
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:56,584
Say your good-byes,
little man.

427
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:06,760
Keep this one safe.

428
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:10,596
He means
the world to me.

429
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:34,221
We've been waiting
a long time.

430
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,259
Haven't we?

431
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:41,195
I don't know,
you tell me.

432
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,431
How long does it take
to sack a city?

433
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:53,774
It was just as you said.

434
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:57,210
They did not believe
until it was too late.

435
00:35:57,244 --> 00:35:59,245
Their slave soldiers

436
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,749
threw down their spears
and surrendered.

437
00:36:06,853 --> 00:36:09,422
And Daario Naharis?

438
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,547
The city is yours,
my queen.

439
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,206
They're good,
aren't they?

440
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,974
They ought to be
because they cost enough.

441
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,385
Look at the crowd there.

442
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,024
He complained
about this marriage

443
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:17,293
the entire ride
from Riverrun,

444
00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:18,828
<i>and now look at him.</i>

445
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,829
<i>The gods love</i>
<i>to reward a fool.</i>

446
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,365
- Uncle.
- What?

447
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:26,368
He's my nephew.
I love him.

448
00:37:26,402 --> 00:37:28,404
And he's a damned fool.

449
00:37:33,776 --> 00:37:36,178
Don't you drink,
Lord Bolton?

450
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,514
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.

451
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,783
That's the point.

452
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:42,618
Didn't you marry
one of these Frey girls?

453
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:44,120
Aye.

454
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:46,222
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

455
00:37:46,256 --> 00:37:50,359
and promised me the girl's
weight in silver as a dowry.

456
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:52,228
So I have
a fat young bride.

457
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:56,232
I hope she makes you
very happy.

458
00:37:56,266 --> 00:37:58,067
Well, she's made me
very rich.

459
00:37:58,135 --> 00:38:00,737
Pardon, my lord,
my lady.

460
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:03,239
I need to find
a tree to piss on.

461
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,644
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton.

462
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,112
I should rescue her.

463
00:38:09,146 --> 00:38:11,080
Your mother is less
in need of rescue

464
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:13,082
than any woman
I've ever met.

465
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:14,184
Be kind.

466
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:16,219
She's finally starting
to like you.

467
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:19,689
And I like her.

468
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:22,926
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

469
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,229
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

470
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:29,266
<i>eating blackberries</i>
<i>out of Roslin Frey's hand.</i>

471
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,468
Perhaps I've made
a terrible mistake.

472
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:37,274
Striking your king
is an act of treason.

473
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,380
No, don't.

474
00:38:43,315 --> 00:38:44,949
Don't insult them.

475
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,620
Your Grace.

476
00:38:56,394 --> 00:39:00,297
The septon has prayed
his prayers,

477
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:02,532
<i>some words were said,</i>

478
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,367
and Lord Edmure

479
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:07,336
has wrapped my daughter
in a cloak.

480
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:11,808
But they are not yet
man and wife.

481
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:14,411
A sword needs a sheath.

482
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:24,220
And a wedding needs a bedding.

483
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:26,122
What does my sire say?

484
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:29,159
To bed! To bed! To bed!

485
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:36,867
If you think the time
is right, Lord Walder,

486
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:41,104
by all means,
let us bed them.

487
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,381
To bed! To bed! To bed!

488
00:39:56,388 --> 00:39:58,890
<i>Go on!</i>

489
00:40:16,576 --> 00:40:19,678
Oh!
Careful now, ladies.

490
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,746
Once you set
that monster free,

491
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:24,549
there's no caging
him again.

492
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:27,885
To bed! To bed! To bed!

493
00:40:31,623 --> 00:40:33,224
Poor girl.

494
00:40:33,258 --> 00:40:36,160
Every bride
suffers the same.

495
00:40:36,194 --> 00:40:38,796
I'm sure you endured
yours with grace.

496
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,332
Oh, Ned forbade it.

497
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:42,455
He said it wouldn't be right

498
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,512
if he broke a man's jaw
on our wedding night.

499
00:40:53,046 --> 00:40:56,147
That is a very
strange custom.

500
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:58,083
I suppose it does
seem strange

501
00:40:58,117 --> 00:40:59,784
from a foreigner's
perspective.

502
00:40:59,819 --> 00:41:01,620
It seems normal
to you?

503
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:04,056
It's a tradition.

504
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:08,760
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

505
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:11,330
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

506
00:41:11,364 --> 00:41:14,700
But there are other ways
of providing proof.

507
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,837
Boy or girl?

508
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,909
I don't know.

509
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:26,112
But if it's a boy, I know
what we should name him.

510
00:41:26,146 --> 00:41:28,314
Oh, do you?

511
00:41:28,348 --> 00:41:29,723
It seems to me the father

512
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,761
should have some say in
his son's naming.

513
00:41:31,852 --> 00:41:33,186
Eddard.

514
00:41:36,857 --> 00:41:38,892
Don't you want to teach
little Ned Stark

515
00:41:38,926 --> 00:41:41,361
how to ride horses?

516
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:43,596
I do.

517
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:41,686
<i>Go on, line 'em up!</i>

518
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,741
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

519
00:43:04,012 --> 00:43:05,546
Where are you going?

520
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:07,314
Got salt pork
for the feast.

521
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:09,549
The feast is over.

522
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:11,985
<i>Doesn't sound</i>
<i>like it's over.</i>

523
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:14,887
If I tell you
it's over, it's over.

524
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:19,124
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

525
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:21,126
Got pig's feet, too.

526
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:24,395
Are you soft
in the head?

527
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,164
Turn this cart around.

528
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,444
Your Grace.

529
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:50,621
<i>I feel</i>
<i>I've been remiss</i>

530
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,389
in my duties.

531
00:43:52,423 --> 00:43:56,127
<i>I've given you meat</i>
<i>and wine and music,</i>

532
00:43:56,161 --> 00:43:58,829
<i>but I haven't shown you</i>

533
00:43:58,864 --> 00:44:01,932
<i>the hospitality</i>
<i>you deserve.</i>

534
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,569
<i>My king has married</i>

535
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:08,039
<i>and I owe my new queen</i>
<i>a wedding gift.</i>

536
00:44:12,812 --> 00:44:15,314
Robb!

537
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:04,227
You ready to head home
to Winterfell, right?

538
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:08,965
<i>Feast over yet, is it?</i>

539
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,501
Aye, it's over.

540
00:45:41,832 --> 00:45:43,632
Follow him.

541
00:45:46,136 --> 00:45:48,437
<i>Aim!</i>

542
00:46:17,102 --> 00:46:19,437
It's too late.

543
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:03,379
The King
in the North arises.

544
00:47:25,036 --> 00:47:27,237
Lord Walder!

545
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:28,905
Lord Walder, enough!

546
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:31,374
Let it end!

547
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:35,011
Please.

548
00:47:35,078 --> 00:47:37,180
He is my son.

549
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:39,515
<i>My first son.</i>

550
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,118
Let him go and I swear
that we will forget this.

551
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:44,821
I swear it by
the old gods and new.

552
00:47:44,855 --> 00:47:46,356
We will take
no vengeance.

553
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:50,060
You already swore me one oath
right here in my castle.

554
00:47:50,095 --> 00:47:53,897
You swore by all the gods your
son would marry my daughter!

555
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:57,267
<i>Take me for a hostage,</i>
<i>but let Robb go.</i>

556
00:47:57,302 --> 00:47:59,469
Robb, get up.

557
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:01,238
Get up and walk out.

558
00:48:01,272 --> 00:48:03,673
Please!

559
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:08,078
Please!

560
00:48:08,112 --> 00:48:11,949
And why would I
let him do that?

561
00:48:14,586 --> 00:48:17,321
On my honor as a Tully,

562
00:48:17,389 --> 00:48:20,124
on my honor as a Stark,

563
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:23,027
let him go

564
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:26,164
or I will cut
your wife's throat.

565
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,241
I'll find another.

566
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:42,480
Mother.

567
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:45,249
The Lannisters send
their regards.
