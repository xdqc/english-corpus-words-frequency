1
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,202
I'll give you one try, girl.

2
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,907
Kill me and you're free.

3
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:41,677
But if I live,
I'll break both your hands.

4
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,748
Go on, hit me.

5
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:48,484
<i>Hit me hard.</i>

6
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,428
Sulk all you want.

7
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:03,331
The truth is,
you're lucky.

8
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,135
You don't want to be
alone out here, girl.

9
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,770
Someone worse than me
would find you.

10
00:03:09,804 --> 00:03:11,739
There's no one
worse than you.

11
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,974
Ha, you never knew
my brother.

12
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:16,543
He once killed a man
for snoring.

13
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:19,113
There's plenty
worse than me.

14
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,648
There's men who like
to beat little girls,

15
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,717
men who like
to rape them.

16
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,853
I saved your sister
from some of them.

17
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:29,156
You're lying.

18
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,258
Ask her, if you
ever see her again.

19
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,993
Ask her who
came back for her

20
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,863
when the mob
had her on her back.

21
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:39,300
They would have
taken her every which way

22
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:41,835
and left her there
with her throat cut open.

23
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:49,544
Is that the Blackwater?

24
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:52,013
The Blackwater?

25
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:54,381
Where do you think
I'm taking you?

26
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:59,120
Back to King's Landing
to Joffrey and the queen.

27
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:01,889
Fuck Joffrey.
Fuck the queen.

28
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,825
That's the Red Fork.

29
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,327
I'm taking you
to the Twins.

30
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,564
But why?

31
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,267
Because your mother
and brother will be there

32
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,402
and they'll pay me for you.

33
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,907
Why would they be
at the Twins?

34
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:22,812
Those outlaws you love
so much never told you?

35
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,481
The whole countryside
is yapping about it.

36
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:30,019
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

37
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:32,054
So quit trying
to bash my skull in

38
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,724
and we might just make it there
in time for the wedding.

39
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:55,576
Men who fight for gold
have neither honor nor loyalty.

40
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,178
<i>They cannot be trusted.</i>

41
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:59,847
<i>They can be trusted to kill</i>
<i>you if they're well paid.</i>

42
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,150
<i>The Yunkish</i>
<i>are paying them well.</i>

43
00:05:02,184 --> 00:05:03,918
You know these men?

44
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:06,620
Only by the broken swords
on their banners.

45
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:09,456
They're called
the Second Sons.

46
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,392
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero,

47
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:15,061
"The Titan's Bastard."

48
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:17,463
Is he more titan
or bastard?

49
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:19,766
He's a dangerous man,
khaleesi.

50
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,835
They all are.

51
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,172
How many?

52
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:27,775
<i>2,000, Your Grace.</i>

53
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:29,477
<i>Armored and mounted.</i>

54
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,713
Enough to make
a difference?

55
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,352
It's hard to collect
wages from a corpse.

56
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:41,189
I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for the winning side.

57
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:43,224
I imagine you're right.

58
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:47,495
I'd like to talk to the
Titan's Bastard about winning.

59
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,598
He may not agree
to meet.

60
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,066
He will.

61
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,803
A man who fights for gold can't
afford to lose to a girl.

62
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:57,406
<i>Your Grace,</i>
<i>allow me to present</i>

63
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,408
<i>the captains</i>
<i>of the Second Sons--</i>

64
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,444
Mero of Braavos,

65
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,547
Prendahl na Ghezn,

66
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,016
and...

67
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,551
Daario Naharis.

68
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:16,790
You are the Mother
of Dragons?

69
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:20,728
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

70
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:23,497
- Mind your tongue.
<i>- Why?</i>

71
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,934
I didn't mind hers.

72
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,870
She licked my ass
like she was born to do it.

73
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:34,510
You, slave girl,
bring wine.

74
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,846
We have no slaves here.

75
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,881
You'll all be slaves
after the battle

76
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,017
unless I save you.

77
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:45,455
Take your clothes off
and come and sit on Mero's lap

78
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,257
and I may give you
my Second Sons.

79
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,160
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

80
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:53,363
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

81
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,832
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

82
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:57,534
We have more,
don't we?

83
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,103
<i>10,000 Unsullied.</i>

84
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,138
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

85
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,207
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

86
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:07,678
can explain to me
how you propose to defeat us.

87
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:10,547
I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.

88
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:13,551
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

89
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:17,922
You're very young
to be a captain.

90
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,558
He's not a captain.
He's a lieutenant.

91
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:22,627
Even if your numbers
are right,

92
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:24,962
you must admit the odds
don't favor your side.

93
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:27,031
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and won.

94
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,800
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

95
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:32,971
Or you could
fight for me.

96
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:37,975
We've taken
the slavers' gold.

97
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,744
We fight for Yunkai.

98
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:43,047
<i>I would pay</i>
<i>you as much and more.</i>

99
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,217
Our contract
is our bond.

100
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,751
If we break our bond,

101
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:49,954
no one will hire
the Second Sons again.

102
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:53,224
Ride with me and you'll
never need another contract.

103
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:56,660
You'll have gold and castles
and lordships of your choosing

104
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:58,262
when I take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

105
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:00,798
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

106
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:02,500
You have no cavalry.

107
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,069
A fortnight ago,
I had no army.

108
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:07,438
A year ago,
I had no dragons.

109
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,042
You have two days
to decide.

110
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:18,015
Show me your cunt. I want
to see if it's worth fighting for.

111
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:26,589
You seem to be
enjoying my wine.

112
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:29,125
Perhaps you'd like
a flagon to help you ponder.

113
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,960
Only a flagon?

114
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:33,028
And what are my brothers
in arms to drink?

115
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:35,697
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

116
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:39,167
The Titan's Bastard
does not drink alone.

117
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,873
In the Second Sons,
we share everything.

118
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:46,308
After the battle,
maybe we'll all share you.

119
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:53,916
I'll come looking for you
when this is over.

120
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,221
Ser Barristan,

121
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:03,192
if it comes to battle,
kill that one first.

122
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,361
Gladly, Your Grace.

123
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,883
Half Robert,
half lowborn.

124
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,420
Show the boy
to his chambers.

125
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,724
<i>Have the maids draw him</i>
<i>a bath and find him some decent clothes.</i>

126
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,927
I'll come visit you soon.

127
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:20,437
What do you mean
to do with him?

128
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:22,106
You know what I mean
to do with him.

129
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,274
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

130
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,977
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

131
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:29,313
Have you ever slaughtered
a lamb, my king?

132
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,181
No.

133
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,284
If the lamb
sees the knife,

134
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,386
she panics.

135
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:38,555
Her panic seeps
into her meat,

136
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:40,824
darkens it,
fouls the flavor.

137
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:43,226
You've slaughtered
many lambs?

138
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,329
And none have seen
the blade.

139
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,509
"And tho-- and thowg...

Your Grace.

154
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,933
They feeding you enough?

00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,702
<i>Two meals a day.</i>

156
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,037
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper.

157
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,872
I cannot complain.

158
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:08,109
You don't belong
in a place like this.

159
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:11,245
Well, it's sad to say,
but I've seen worse.

160
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:13,881
Yeah.

161
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm sorry about your son.

162
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,357
<i>Didn't get the chance</i>
<i>to tell you before.</i>

163
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:25,594
Good lad.
Loyal lad.

164
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,867
Melisandre's returned.

165
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:34,170
I didn't know
she'd been gone.

166
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:36,339
Came back
with a bastard boy.

167
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:39,843
Robert's bastard boy.

168
00:12:39,877 --> 00:12:41,711
Why?

169
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:44,547
She says there's power
in king's blood.

170
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:47,650
She's going to kill him.

171
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,018
Sacrifice him.

172
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,587
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

173
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:53,856
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

174
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,625
The boy is your nephew.

175
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,127
What of it?
We're at war.

176
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:01,064
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

177
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:04,067
Robert bedded
one drunken night?

178
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,103
Because he has
your blood in his veins.

179
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:11,042
So did Renly.

180
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:13,311
Renly wronged you.

181
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:16,081
Renly declared himself king when
the throne belonged to you.

182
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:18,583
He raised an army,
stole your bannermen.

183
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,786
This boy has
done you no harm.

184
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,489
- He's an innocent.
- How many boys live in Westeros?

185
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:27,093
How many girls?
How many men? How many women?

186
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:29,361
The darkness will devour
them all, she says.

187
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,297
The night that never ends.

188
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,266
Unless I triumph.

189
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,801
I never asked for this.

190
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:36,536
No more than I asked
to be king.

191
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,940
We do not choose
our destiny,

192
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:42,509
but we must do
our duty, no?

193
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,278
Great or small,
we must do our duty.

194
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:50,617
What's one bastard boy
against a kingdom?

195
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,956
Your Grace,

196
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,091
why did you come
to see me today?

197
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,860
I came to free you.

198
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:04,564
If you swear never to raise your
hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

199
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:07,766
I swear it.

200
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:10,069
I can't swear never
to speak against her.

201
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,138
You have little regard
for your own life.

202
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,240
Quite little, Your Grace.

203
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:16,642
Verging on none.

204
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:20,479
You could have freed me
yesterday or tomorrow,

205
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:23,149
but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife

206
00:14:23,183 --> 00:14:26,986
because you knew
I'd counsel restraint.

207
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:31,323
You came to hear me say it
because you believe it yourself.

208
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:33,792
You're not a man
who slaughters innocents

209
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:36,228
for gain or glory.

210
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,269
When my son was five
he said to me,

211
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:45,771
"I don't ever
want to die."

212
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:49,107
I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child. You won't ever."

213
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:54,078
<i>I hated the idea of him</i>
<i>lying awake in the dark, afraid.</i>

214
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,784
I think mothers and fathers
made up the gods

215
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:02,987
because they wanted their children
to sleep through the night.

216
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,024
I saw a vision
in the flames.

217
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:12,129
A great battle
in the snow.

218
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:13,965
I saw it.

219
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:20,171
And you saw whatever
she gave birth to.

220
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:24,009
<i>I never believed,</i>
<i>but when you see the truth,</i>

221
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,578
when it's right there
in front of you

222
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:29,180
as real as these iron bars,

223
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:32,250
how can you deny
her god is real?

224
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,741
Little dragon bitch.
She talks too much.

225
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,476
You talk too much.

226
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,079
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

227
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:02,781
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

228
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:05,584
My cock will find a way.

229
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,294
Tell him.

230
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,583
Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

231
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:11,290
She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.

232
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:14,626
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

233
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,696
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

234
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:20,699
And I'm no whore,
my friend.

235
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:23,035
She sells her sheath
and you sell your blade.

236
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,537
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

237
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:27,072
For beauty?

238
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:28,673
We fight for gold.

239
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:33,045
The gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die--

240
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,981
the thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked

241
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:39,351
and the thrill of killing
a man who wants to kill you.

242
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:40,886
You'll die young.

243
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,487
<i>What do we do</i>
<i>about the dragon girl?</i>

244
00:16:42,522 --> 00:16:45,357
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

245
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:48,093
There won't be a battle. And we don't
have to deal with her eunuchs.

246
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,628
We only have
to deal with her.

247
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:52,230
- She's well guarded.
<i>- Tonight's a new moon.</i>

248
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:55,867
One of us slips into her camp past
her Unsullied and her knights.

249
00:16:57,236 --> 00:16:59,538
Which one of us?

250
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:02,507
Close your eyes, love.

251
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:11,082
Three coins.

252
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,984
A coin from Meereen,

253
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,253
a coin from Volantis,

254
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,855
and a coin from Braavos.

255
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:18,556
The Braavosi
does the deed.

256
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:25,129
One for each
of us, darling.

257
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,032
No peeking.

258
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,583
Do you hear me?

259
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:49,119
Follow my voice.
I'm right here.

260
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,489
You have
something for me?

261
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:58,896
Valar morghulis.

262
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:22,653
Lady Sansa.

263
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:26,057
You look very handsome,
my lord.

264
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,658
Oh, yes.

265
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:30,094
The husband
of your dreams.

266
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,763
But you do
look glorious.

267
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:39,770
Perhaps we could have
a moment alone.

268
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:41,439
Do you mind?

269
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:46,644
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

270
00:19:02,196 --> 00:19:04,164
My lady,

271
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,733
I want you to know

272
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,102
I didn't ask for this.

273
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:11,838
I hope I will not
disappoint you, my lord.

274
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:13,573
No, don't.

275
00:19:13,607 --> 00:19:16,543
You don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

276
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:18,578
You won't be a prisoner
after today.

277
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,681
You'll be my wife.

278
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:25,086
I suppose that's a different
kind of prison.

279
00:19:26,856 --> 00:19:28,757
I just wanted to say--

280
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:32,428
I'm just trying
to say very badly--

281
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,332
I just--

282
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:39,167
just want to say
I know how you feel.

283
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:44,405
I doubt that
very much, my lord.

284
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,875
You're right.

285
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,244
I have no idea
how you feel.

286
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,546
And you have no idea
how I feel.

287
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:02,622
But I promise you
one thing, my lady.

288
00:20:03,925 --> 00:20:06,326
I won't ever hurt you.

289
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:12,732
Do you drink wine?

290
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,302
When I have to.

291
00:20:15,336 --> 00:20:18,572
Well, today you have to.

292
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,848
<i>You look radiant,</i>
<i>Your Grace.</i>

293
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:30,484
Radiant?
Why radiant?

294
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:32,353
It's the word
that came to mind.

295
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:36,424
We're going
to be sisters soon.

296
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,860
We should be friends.

297
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:41,429
You're a musical girl,
aren't you?

298
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,299
I imagine you have
a lovely voice.

299
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,269
A better dancer
than a singer, I'm afraid.

300
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:49,871
Ah, but you know the song
"The Rains of Castamere"?

301
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:53,409
Of course. They play it
so often here at court.

302
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:56,412
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

303
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:58,914
Not as well as you,
I'm sure.

304
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:01,082
House Reyne
was a powerful family.

305
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:02,517
Very wealthy.

306
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:05,086
The second wealthiest
in Westeros.

307
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,490
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

308
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,959
Of course, ambitious climbers
don't want to stop

309
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:14,294
on the second highest rung.

310
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:17,163
If only you could take
that final step,

311
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:20,066
you'd see further
than all the rest.

312
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:23,069
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

313
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,039
So Lord Reyne
built a castle

314
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,041
as grand as Casterly Rock.

315
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:29,643
He gave his wife diamonds

316
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:32,212
larger than any
my mother ever wore.

317
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:34,581
And finally one day,

318
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:36,950
he rebelled
against my father.

319
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,653
Do you know where
House Reyne is now?

320
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:41,221
Gone.

321
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,523
Gone.

322
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:45,793
A gentle word.

323
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:48,328
Why not say slaughtered?

324
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:51,231
Every man, woman,
and child

325
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,734
put to the sword.

326
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,803
I remember seeing
their bodies hanging

327
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:58,472
high above the gates
of Casterly Rock.

328
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:01,409
My father let them rot
up there all summer.

329
00:22:01,443 --> 00:22:03,844
It was a long summer.

330
00:22:03,878 --> 00:22:07,514
"And now the rains
weep o'er their halls,

331
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:09,616
and not a soul to hear."

332
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:16,823
If you ever
call me sister again,

333
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:19,492
I'll have you strangled
in your sleep.

334
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,925
What are you doing?

335
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,694
Your father's gone.

336
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:57,830
As the father
of the realm,

337
00:22:57,865 --> 00:23:01,267
it is my duty to give you away
to your husband.

338
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,788
You may now
cloak the bride

339
00:24:25,823 --> 00:24:28,891
and bring her
under your protection.

340
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,924
Could you...

341
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,833
Thank you.

342
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,809
Your Grace,
Your Grace,

343
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:18,411
<i>my lords, my ladies,</i>

344
00:25:18,446 --> 00:25:21,615
<i>we stand here in the sight</i>
<i>of gods and men</i>

345
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:25,051
<i>to witness the union</i>
<i>of man and wife.</i>

346
00:25:25,086 --> 00:25:28,955
<i>One flesh, one heart,</i>
<i>one soul,</i>

347
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,892
now and forever.

348
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:51,209
Have you ever
seen one like it?

349
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:54,178
I've never seen anything
like any of this.

350
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:55,879
Not in my life.

351
00:25:55,914 --> 00:25:57,648
It's shocking, isn't it,

352
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,750
the first time
you encounter real wealth?

353
00:25:59,784 --> 00:26:03,720
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

354
00:26:03,755 --> 00:26:06,657
And stew
is a kind word for it.

355
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,528
In Flea Bottom we called them
bowls of brown.

356
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:14,632
We'd pretend that the meat
in them was chicken.

357
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:17,769
We knew
it wasn't chicken.

358
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:32,518
Here, taste this.

359
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:35,088
You think I'm trying
to poison you?

360
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,776
That's good.

361
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:03,981
That's really good.

362
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:06,316
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>it's from?</i>

363
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:08,085
I couldn't even guess.

364
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,853
Doesn't matter, does it?

365
00:27:09,888 --> 00:27:12,056
It's the real thing
or it's not.

366
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,259
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

367
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,630
Go on,
have some more.

368
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:26,570
You still
don't trust it.

369
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,172
You think this
is all a mistake

370
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:30,908
and that you'll have to pay
somehow for every bite you take.

371
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:33,277
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

372
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,414
There are no mistakes.

373
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,383
Not for us.

374
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:42,986
I'm a mistake.

375
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,222
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

376
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:47,190
instead of the girl
next to her in the tavern.

377
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:50,927
Your father chose your mother because
the Lord of Light willed it.

378
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,730
He willed it so you
could be here right now

379
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:55,998
with a power inside you

380
00:27:56,033 --> 00:27:59,034
you can't even begin
to understand.

381
00:28:01,338 --> 00:28:04,140
And He brought me here
to draw it from you

382
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:06,142
and birth it
into the world.

383
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:11,380
We're both a part
of His plan.

384
00:28:12,382 --> 00:28:14,049
He wants this for us.

385
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:16,919
No, He demands
this of us.

386
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:23,259
I don't understand.
This--

387
00:28:23,293 --> 00:28:25,094
this doesn't seem
very religious.

388
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:27,596
According to whom?

389
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:31,066
The Silent Sisters?

390
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,034
With their stern looks,

391
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:36,371
muzzled mouths,
and dried-up cunts?

392
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,341
What have their gods
done for you?

393
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:42,376
Hmm?

394
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:44,145
When you pray to them,

395
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:46,413
what's their answer?

396
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:49,016
A god is real
or he's not.

397
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,886
You only need eyes
to see.

398
00:28:57,257 --> 00:29:00,560
Death is coming
for everyone and everything.

399
00:29:00,594 --> 00:29:03,563
A darkness that will
swallow the dawn.

400
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:08,435
And we can stop it,
you and I.

401
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:38,732
Let me show you
what you have inside you.

402
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,801
Come fight death with me.

403
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:12,234
What are you doing?

404
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:17,339
You have to trust me.

405
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:42,064
What--?

406
00:30:42,098 --> 00:30:44,500
Get it away.

407
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:45,901
Get it off me.

408
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:48,704
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

409
00:30:49,773 --> 00:30:51,741
Why are you
doing this?

410
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,745
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

411
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,748
And you have so much blood.

412
00:30:57,782 --> 00:31:00,817
No. No, no, no, no!

413
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,022
Not there.
Not there!

414
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:12,662
You can blame Ser Davos.

415
00:31:12,697 --> 00:31:15,331
He didn't believe in
the power of king's blood.

416
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,602
He wanted a demonstration.

417
00:31:19,637 --> 00:31:22,806
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, Your Grace.</i>

418
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,309
<i>My lord!</i>

419
00:32:00,944 --> 00:32:03,412
The usurper Robb Stark.

420
00:32:06,616 --> 00:32:09,118
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

421
00:32:13,324 --> 00:32:15,825
The usurper
Joffrey Baratheon.

422
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:37,645
So their son
will be your nephew.

423
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,281
After you're wed
to Cersei, of course.

424
00:32:41,517 --> 00:32:44,620
And you will be
the king's stepfather

425
00:32:44,654 --> 00:32:46,956
and brother-in-law.

426
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,857
When you marry the king,

427
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:52,761
<i>Joffrey's mother will</i>
<i>become his sister-in-law</i>

428
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:56,865
<i>and your son</i>
<i>will be Loras' nephew?</i>

429
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,635
Grandson?
I'm not sure.

430
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,205
But your brother will become
your father-in-law.

431
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,474
That much
is beyond dispute.

432
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:28,496
Will you pardon me,
my lord?

433
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:32,233
Of course. Of course.
En-- enjoy.

434
00:33:36,037 --> 00:33:39,873
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

435
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,011
I've got a lifetime for that.

436
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:58,225
Stay.

437
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:09,069
You seem rather drunk.

438
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:11,906
Rather less
than I plan to be.

439
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,809
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

440
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:16,410
This isn't about
your wedding.

441
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,746
Renly Baratheon
had a wedding.

442
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,049
Your wife needs a child,

443
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:24,085
a Lannister child,
as soon as possible.

444
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,922
- And?
- If you're going to give her one,

445
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:28,957
you need to perform.

446
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:31,860
What did you once call me?

447
00:34:31,895 --> 00:34:34,363
A drunken little
lust-filled beast.

448
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:36,966
- More than once.
- <i>There you have it.</i>

449
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,068
Nothing to worry about.

450
00:34:39,102 --> 00:34:41,403
Drinking and lust,

451
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:44,072
no man can match me
in these things.

452
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:47,375
I am the god
of tits and wine.

453
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,845
I shall build
a shrine to myself

454
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,780
at the next brothel
I visit.

455
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:56,217
You can drink,
you can joke,

456
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:58,652
you can engage
in juvenile attempts

457
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:00,454
to make your father
uncomfortable,

458
00:35:00,488 --> 00:35:03,290
but you will do your duty.

459
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:43,832
Well...

460
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:49,806
My father once told me--

461
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,076
Nobody cares what
your father once told you.

462
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:17,669
Congratulations,
my lady.

463
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:19,137
Thank you,
Your Grace.

464
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:21,773
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

465
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:23,708
Soon you'll have
a Lannister baby.

466
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:26,945
It's a dream come true
for you, isn't it?

467
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,847
What a glorious day.

468
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:30,348
Yes, Your Grace.

469
00:36:30,383 --> 00:36:32,784
I suppose it doesn't
really matter

470
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,320
which Lannister
puts the baby into you.

471
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,423
Maybe I'll pay you
a visit tonight

472
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,892
after my uncle
passes out.

473
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:42,794
How'd you like that?

474
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,865
You wouldn't?

475
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:49,901
That's all right. Ser Meryn and
Ser Boros will hold you down.

476
00:36:54,174 --> 00:36:56,208
Time for the bedding
ceremony.

477
00:36:57,477 --> 00:36:59,245
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

478
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:02,080
Where's your respect
for tradition, Uncle?

479
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:03,615
Come, everyone.

480
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,918
Pick her up and carry her
to her wedding bed.

481
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:09,688
Get rid of her gown. She won't
be needing it any longer.

482
00:37:09,723 --> 00:37:12,625
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He's not heavy.

483
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:14,493
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

484
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:17,730
There will be
if I command it.

485
00:37:19,533 --> 00:37:22,469
Then you'll be fucking
your own bride

486
00:37:22,503 --> 00:37:25,606
with a wooden cock.

487
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,576
What did you say?

488
00:37:33,114 --> 00:37:37,818
What did you say?!

489
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:41,488
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

490
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,992
<i>I'm sure Tyrion did not mean</i>
<i>to threaten the king.</i>

491
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,034
A bad joke, Your Grace.

492
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:59,638
Made out of envy
of your own royal manhood.

493
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:03,542
Mine is so small.

494
00:38:03,576 --> 00:38:06,412
My poor wife won't
even know I'm there.

495
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:09,782
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

496
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:12,218
<i>I am.</i>

497
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:14,453
Guilty.

498
00:38:15,555 --> 00:38:17,356
But--

499
00:38:19,192 --> 00:38:21,293
but it is my wedding night.

500
00:38:21,328 --> 00:38:25,498
My tiny drunk cock
and I have a job to do.

501
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:29,935
Come, wife.

502
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:35,774
I vomited on a girl once

503
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:37,276
in the middle of the act.

504
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,944
Not proud of it.

505
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:41,881
But I think honesty
is important

506
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,451
between a man and wife,
don't you agree?

507
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:46,954
Come, I'll tell you
all about it.

508
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:49,023
Put you in the mood.

509
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,224
Is that wise,
my lord?

510
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:26,026
Tyrion, Sansa.

511
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:28,128
My name is Tyrion.

512
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:31,131
Is that wise, Tyrion?

513
00:39:36,103 --> 00:39:38,371
Nothing was ever wiser.

514
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:52,784
Astoundingly long.

515
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:54,852
What?

516
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:56,654
Neck.

517
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,489
You have one.

518
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:03,161
How old are you exactly?

519
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,430
14.

520
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:13,438
Well, talk won't
make you any older.

521
00:40:20,513 --> 00:40:24,183
My lord father
has commanded me

522
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,786
to consummate this marriage.

523
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,170
Stop.

524
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,607
I can't.

525
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,213
I could, I won't.

526
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:57,648
But your father--

527
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,250
If my father wants
someone to get fucked,

528
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,485
I know where he can start.

529
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,558
I won't share your bed.

530
00:42:12,862 --> 00:42:15,230
Not until you want me to.

531
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:20,569
What if I never
want you to?

532
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,749
And so my watch begins.

533
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:29,337
19?

534
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:30,639
Yes, Your Grace.

535
00:43:30,673 --> 00:43:33,608
How can anyone
speak 19 languages?

536
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:36,978
It only took Your Grace a year to
learn Dothraki reasonably well.

537
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,214
Yes, well, it was
either learn Dothraki

538
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:42,284
or grunt at my husband
and hope--

539
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,855
what do you mean
reasonably well?

540
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,260
Dothraki is difficult
for the mouth to master.

541
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,395
So guttural and harsh.

542
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,906
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

543
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,476
Athjahaka.

544
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,911
Ath-ja-hakar.

545
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,613
Athjahakar.

546
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:16,418
Well, I suppose
I'm a bit out of practice.

547
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:19,721
Your High Valyrian
is very good, Your Grace.

548
00:44:19,756 --> 00:44:23,191
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

549
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:26,128
<i>It is the only proper</i>
<i>language for poetry.</i>

550
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:34,503
No screaming or she dies.

551
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,218
What do you want?

552
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,288
You.

553
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,856
Let her go.

554
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:56,125
Don't scream,
lovely girl.

555
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:05,233
You were sent here
to kill me?

556
00:45:07,002 --> 00:45:09,103
So why haven't you?

557
00:45:09,138 --> 00:45:10,638
I don't want to.

558
00:45:10,672 --> 00:45:13,640
What do your captains
have to say about that?

559
00:45:13,675 --> 00:45:15,909
You should ask them.

560
00:45:21,248 --> 00:45:22,549
Why?

561
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:25,318
We had philosophical
differences.

562
00:45:25,353 --> 00:45:27,721
- Over what?
- Your beauty.

563
00:45:27,755 --> 00:45:30,691
<i>It meant more to me</i>
<i>than it did to them.</i>

564
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:32,693
You're a strange man.

565
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,728
I'm the simplest man
you'll ever meet.

566
00:45:34,763 --> 00:45:36,263
I only do
what I want to do.

567
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:38,199
And this is supposed
to impress me?

568
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:40,534
Yes.

569
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,106
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

570
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,542
They ordered me
to murder you.

571
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:49,744
<i>I told them</i>
<i>I preferred not to.</i>

572
00:45:49,778 --> 00:45:52,146
<i>They told me</i>
<i>I had no choice.</i>

573
00:45:52,181 --> 00:45:54,249
I told them
I am Daario Naharis.

574
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:57,118
I always have a choice.

575
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:01,023
They drew their swords

576
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:03,158
and I drew mine.

577
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:36,757
Will you fight for me?

578
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:45,534
Swear to me.

579
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:51,274
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

580
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,144
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

581
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,647
my heart is yours.

582
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,268
You really
ought to knock.

583
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:19,571
I brought your breakfast.

584
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,114
It's getting dark.

585
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,316
We could stay here
for the night.

586
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,856
How hard can it be
to build a fire?

587
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,258
It doesn't matter.

588
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,727
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.

589
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,515
He winked at me before.

590
00:49:44,617 --> 00:49:48,353
- I doubt it.
- I saw him wink at me.

591
00:49:48,387 --> 00:49:50,755
He blinked.

592
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:53,591
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

593
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:55,726
between a wink
and a blink.

594
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:58,262
A what?

595
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:03,901
Well, I mean,
there's no real difference.

596
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:08,973
A wink is on purpose.

597
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:13,645
You thought of a name yet?

598
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:20,519
It would be easier to refer
to him if he had a name.

599
00:50:20,553 --> 00:50:23,722
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

600
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:26,425
What? No.

601
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:29,162
This is just
the way I talk.

602
00:50:32,366 --> 00:50:34,501
I'll build that fire.

603
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:45,278
Don't you think
he should have a name?

604
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:49,583
I don't know
many boys' names.

605
00:50:49,617 --> 00:50:51,184
Let's see,

606
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:53,353
there's Duncan,

607
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:56,356
Kevan, Jon...

608
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,291
Guymon,

609
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:00,559
Feldan,
Tristifer.

610
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:03,295
Craster.

611
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,230
Uh, yes.

612
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,066
Maybe that's not--

613
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,101
Mormont.

614
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:12,570
That's a lovely idea,

615
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:14,538
but Mormont's a last name.

616
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:17,474
Why is it a last name?

617
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:20,211
Well, it's a family name.

618
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,882
For instance,
I'm Samwell Tarly.

619
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,185
Samwell is my birth name

620
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:30,588
and Tarly
is my family name.

621
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:35,092
You see?
So my father is also a Tarly.

622
00:51:36,395 --> 00:51:38,696
His name
is Samwell Tarly, too?

623
00:51:38,731 --> 00:51:41,633
No, Randyll Tarly.

624
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:43,702
Randyll is a handsome name.

625
00:51:44,904 --> 00:51:46,739
Please don't
name him Randyll.

626
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,878
Is your father
cruel like mine?

627
00:51:57,452 --> 00:51:59,853
Different manner of cruel.

628
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:14,401
Not Randyll, then.

629
00:52:37,492 --> 00:52:39,627
Don't.

630
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,462
Don't go out there.

631
00:52:41,496 --> 00:52:43,430
I'll be back.

632
00:52:43,465 --> 00:52:45,466
I just want to look.

633
00:53:20,768 --> 00:53:22,969
Go inside.

634
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:25,338
Go back inside.
I'll--

635
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:41,788
It's come for the baby.

636
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:58,205
Stay back!

637
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:07,447
You stay back!

638
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,194
No, you can't have him! No!

639
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:26,398
No!
