1
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,367
How far are we?

2
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,569
About a week, I think.

3
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:15,138
You think?
You don't know?

4
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:18,841
When we went to Castle Black,
we took the kingsroad.

5
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,576
You and your roads.

6
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:24,078
Is that how you lot
do your fighting?

7
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:27,514
You march down the road banging
drums and waving banners?

8
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:29,182
Most of the time, yes.

9
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:32,886
How do the men holding
the banners fight?

10
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,888
They don't, really.

11
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:38,959
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

12
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:42,062
And the drummers--
is that a great honor, too?

13
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:45,098
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

14
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,767
So what good are they?

15
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,204
- They help the men march.
- How?

16
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,808
Well, it's--
it's the rhythm.

17
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:56,344
Oh, you mean right foot,
left foot,

18
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,379
right foot,
left foot, right foot?

19
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:01,583
You need help
remembering that?

20
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:04,853
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

21
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:08,357
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

22
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:10,459
No.

23
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:13,762
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

24
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:17,232
the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

25
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:19,868
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

26
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:24,772
She's right, you don't.

27
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:30,077
I know you cut me
loose on the Wall.

28
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:31,845
Cut her loose, too.

29
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,913
Do you see her
sulking about it?

30
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,017
That's because she understands
the way things are.

31
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,622
And are you gonna
share it with me?

32
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,992
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

33
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,394
People work together
when it suits them.

34
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,096
They're loyal
when it suits them.

35
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,632
They love each other
when it suits them.

36
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,535
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

37
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,705
She knows that,
you don't.

38
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,142
Which is why you'll
never hold onto her.

39
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,627
That rain will cost us
another day.

40
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,032
Frey will wait.
He knows we're coming.

41
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,234
Lord Walder is prickly
by nature.

42
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,636
Prickly?
That what you call it?

43
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,005
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

44
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,674
- Yes, and that is why--
- I've seen wet shits

45
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:36,877
<i>I liked better</i>
<i>than Walder Frey.</i>

46
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,414
Apologies, Your Grace.

47
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,517
Spent too many years around
lancers and pikemen.

48
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:47,353
I've spent the last two years
nursing wounded men,

49
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,555
watching them
bleed and die.

50
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,624
I'm not afraid
of wet shits.

51
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:55,895
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

52
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,597
He can take it
as he likes.

53
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,733
He's getting
the wedding he wanted.

54
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,401
He's getting a wedding.

55
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:03,737
It was a king he wanted.

56
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,773
<i>Edmure is the best match</i>
<i>a Frey has had</i>

57
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,676
in the history
of their house.

58
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,444
We should all
get some sleep.

59
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,125
If you don't put
some clothes on,

60
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,661
I can't promise
I won't attack you again.

61
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,896
Attack. Attack.

62
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,855
<i>Who are you writing?</i>

63
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,291
My mother.

64
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:06,862
- Is that Valyrian?
- Gaaa.

65
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:08,697
Gaaa?

66
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,640
Say hello for me.

67
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,009
<i>Rytsas.</i>

68
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:23,246
<i>"Ritsas."</i>

69
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,281
That was close enough.

70
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,954
Does she know
her daughter's a queen?

71
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:33,090
Not yet.

72
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:37,428
That will be
a surprise, I expect.

73
00:07:40,032 --> 00:07:42,066
Many surprises for her.

74
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,740
How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war

75
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:51,076
when you're over there
looking like that?

76
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:58,283
Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?

77
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,886
<i>When all this is over?</i>

78
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,155
I will.

79
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,558
I promise.

80
00:08:09,763 --> 00:08:13,266
<i>I know she'd love</i>
<i>to meet you.</i>

81
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,402
And her grandchild.

82
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,208
What, now?

83
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:29,282
Are you certain?

84
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,453
Are you angry with me?

85
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:35,255
Angry?

86
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,660
You're my queen.

87
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:47,200
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

88
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:50,737
Maybe one of each.

89
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,772
Don't get greedy.

90
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:05,017
Can you leave the war
for one night?

91
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:09,422
I love you.

92
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,327
Do you hear me?

93
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:15,863
I love you.

94
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,947
Most men fuck like dogs.

95
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,584
No grace, no skill.

96
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,653
A few dozen thrusts
and done.

97
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:42,789
You need to be patient.
Give her time.

98
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,091
Your cock shouldn't
go near her

99
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,427
till she's slick
as a baby seal.

100
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:51,196
And then you go inside,

101
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:52,865
<i>but slowly.</i>

102
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,335
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

103
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:57,937
Come on!

104
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:01,407
Hey, come on.

105
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,721
You think he loves you,
is that it?

106
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:18,591
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady

107
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,094
and live with you
in some castle?

108
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:23,763
No, he didn't
tell me anything.

109
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:25,532
He barely talks.

110
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,768
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

111
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,970
giggling like
a pair of girls.

112
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,871
What, you're jealous?

113
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,807
Of course I'm jealous.

114
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,675
You should be
with one of your own.

115
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,510
And you're one of my own?

116
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:39,304
I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.

117
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:42,514
You would
if you were mine.

118
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:47,218
I'd tell you
that you're beautiful

119
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:50,589
and fierce and wild.

120
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:52,757
I'd be good to you.

121
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:57,695
You love him?

122
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,870
'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?

123
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:10,007
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

124
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,810
You think pretty
is gonna make you happy?

125
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:14,678
Don't touch me.

126
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,882
You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.

127
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:25,022
Growing up at Winterfell, all
I ever wanted was to escape,

128
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:29,193
to come here
to the capital.

129
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:31,862
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

130
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:35,366
and King's Landing
after dark--

131
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:39,904
all the candles burning
in all those windows.

132
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:44,074
I'm stupid.

133
00:11:44,943 --> 00:11:46,577
A stupid little girl

134
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,580
with stupid dreams
who never learns.

135
00:11:49,614 --> 00:11:51,548
Come on.

136
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,452
Come walk with me.

137
00:11:57,188 --> 00:12:00,156
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

138
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:03,459
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

139
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:05,928
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

140
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:08,097
and so does my grandmother.

141
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:13,135
You would have been
happy at Highgarden.

142
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,703
But women in our position

143
00:12:14,738 --> 00:12:17,740
must make the best
of our circumstances.

144
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:20,777
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

145
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,079
I have to marry him.

146
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:28,118
- Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
- No.

147
00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:30,654
Has he been kind to you?

148
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:32,956
He's tried.

149
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,457
You don't want
him, though.

150
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:35,792
He's a Lannister.

151
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:38,428
Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

152
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:41,665
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,534
Here I am
complaining to you...

154
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:47,137
My son will be king.

155
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:48,639
Sons learn
from their mothers.

156
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:51,574
I plan to teach mine
a great deal.

157
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,411
And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,

158
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:58,382
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

159
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,284
and the North someday.

160
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:04,588
What?

161
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,090
My son...

162
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:09,225
with him.

163
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,997
I'll have to--

164
00:13:14,031 --> 00:13:15,966
we'll have to--

165
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,935
If it's the pain
you're worried about--

166
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:20,170
I'm not afraid
of the pain.

167
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:22,306
Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.

168
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,941
What is it, then?

169
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,479
He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.

170
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:30,715
Especially with the scar.

171
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,150
He's a dwarf.

172
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:35,386
And Loras--

173
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:37,188
Loras.

174
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:42,427
Some women like tall men.

175
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:44,096
Some like short men.

176
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,899
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.

177
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:50,135
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,

178
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,538
pretty girls.

179
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:55,641
Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.

180
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:59,311
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

181
00:13:59,345 --> 00:14:01,613
before we're old and gray.

182
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:04,683
Tyrion may surprise you.

183
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,420
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

184
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:11,690
And that's a good thing?

185
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,125
<i>It can be.</i>

186
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,927
We're very complicated,
you know.

187
00:14:14,962 --> 00:14:17,296
Pleasing us
takes practice.

188
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,732
How do you know
all this?

189
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:22,167
Did your mother teach you?

190
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:28,206
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.

191
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,713
<i>She's a child.</i>

192
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,281
<i>She's a foot</i>
<i>taller than you.</i>

193
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,116
A tall child.

194
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,185
What's the youngest
you've ever had?

195
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,720
Not that young.

196
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,989
How much older?

197
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:44,758
Older.

198
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,895
You're a lord,
she's a lady.

199
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,763
And a beauty at that.

200
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:51,331
I don't see the problem.

201
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,634
Shae isn't going
to like it.

202
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:55,402
Shae is a whore.

203
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,039
Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?

204
00:14:58,073 --> 00:15:01,142
How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?

205
00:15:01,177 --> 00:15:04,112
I should never have
told you about that.

206
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:07,515
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

207
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,719
All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.

208
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:12,621
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

209
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,856
You can rule the North
in his name.

210
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,659
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

211
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:19,528
Two women to despise me

212
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:21,863
and a whole kingdom
to join them.

213
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,701
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

214
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:29,504
you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.

215
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:35,611
You want to fuck
that Stark girl.

216
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:38,246
<i>You just don't want</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

217
00:15:38,281 --> 00:15:42,184
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

218
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:45,054
The ones already there
don't need company.

219
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:47,656
You pay me to kill people
who bother you.

220
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:52,561
Evil notions come free.

221
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,627
Your Grace.

222
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:28,763
Grandfather.

223
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:31,099
You wanted
to speak to me?

224
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:32,900
Yes.

225
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:36,938
I'd like a report on the meetings
of my small council.

226
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:39,041
You're welcome
to attend the meetings

227
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:41,277
of your small council,
Your Grace.

228
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,779
Any or all of them.

229
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,648
I've been very busy.

230
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:47,284
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

231
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:49,486
Of course.

232
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:53,056
You've been holding
the council meetings

233
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,659
in the Tower of the Hand instead of
the small council chamber.

234
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:58,361
I have, yes.

235
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:01,398
May I ask why?

236
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:04,434
The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.

237
00:17:04,469 --> 00:17:07,637
To walk from there
to here would take time,

238
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:10,340
time I could otherwise
spend productively.

239
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:12,742
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

240
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:16,646
I would now have to climb
all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

241
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:34,965
We could arrange
to have you carried.

242
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,270
Tell me about
the Targaryen girl

243
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:43,339
in the east
and her dragons.

244
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,008
Where did you hear
about this?

245
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:47,510
Is it true?

246
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,612
Apparently so.

247
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,884
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

248
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,620
When I was
Hand of the King

249
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:00,889
under your father's
predecessor,

250
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:03,525
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

251
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,993
were kept in this room.

252
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,763
The skull
of the last of them

253
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,832
was right here.

254
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:15,302
It was the size
of an apple.

255
00:18:16,504 --> 00:18:19,306
And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.

256
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:22,109
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged

257
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,312
died 300 years ago.

258
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:27,948
Curiosities on the far
side of the world

259
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,316
are no threat to us.

260
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:32,753
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

261
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:35,823
and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?

262
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:38,826
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

263
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,995
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

264
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,963
on matters about
which he knows nothing.

265
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,432
But I haven't
been counseled.

266
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:49,136
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

267
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,375
I should be consulted
about such things.

268
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:55,910
From now on,
I will see to it

269
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:58,012
that you are
appropriately consulted

270
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,314
on important matters

271
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,450
whenever necessary.

272
00:19:08,423 --> 00:19:09,957
Your Grace.

273
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,004
Yunkai.

274
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,105
The Yellow City.

275
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:34,212
<i>The Yunkish train</i>
<i>bed slaves, not soldiers.</i>

276
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:36,281
We can defeat them.

277
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:38,750
On the field,
with ease.

278
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:40,519
But they won't
meet us on the field.

279
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:43,722
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

280
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:46,225
<i>If they're wise,</i>
<i>they'll hide behind those walls</i>

281
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,961
and chip away at us,
man by man.

282
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:52,965
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

283
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:56,235
We don't need
Yunkai, khaleesi.

284
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,939
Taking this city will not bring
you any closer to Westeros

285
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:01,241
or the Iron Throne.

286
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,346
How many slaves
are there in Yunkai?

287
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:10,351
200,000,
if not more.

288
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:14,388
Then we have 200,000 reasons
to take the city.

289
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:57,221
Now comes the noble
Razdal mo Eraz

290
00:21:57,256 --> 00:22:00,692
of that ancient
and honorable house,

291
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,061
<i>master of men</i>
<i>and speaker to savages,</i>

292
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:06,698
<i>to offer terms of peace.</i>

293
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:09,000
Noble lord, you are
in the presence

294
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,903
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

295
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:14,572
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

296
00:22:14,606 --> 00:22:16,774
<i>Khaleesi</i>
<i>of the Great Grass Sea,</i>

297
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:20,144
<i>Breaker of Chains,</i>
<i>and Mother of Dragons.</i>

298
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:24,382
You may approach.
Sit.

299
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:36,092
Will the noble lord
take refreshment?

300
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,107
Ancient and glorious
is Yunkai.

301
00:22:51,141 --> 00:22:52,775
Our empire was old

302
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:55,845
before dragons stirred
in old Valyria.

303
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:59,148
<i>Many an army has broken</i>
<i>against our walls.</i>

304
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:01,918
You shall find no easy
conquest here, khaleesi.

305
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:08,291
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.

306
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:10,293
I was told
to blood them early.

307
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,498
If blood is your desire,
blood shall flow.

308
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,268
But why?

309
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:20,637
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

310
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:24,875
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

311
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:30,748
The wise masters of Yunkai
have sent a gift

312
00:23:30,783 --> 00:23:32,416
for the silver queen.

313
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,827
There is far more than this awaiting
you on the deck of your ship.

314
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,895
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

315
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,732
As I said,
we are a generous people.

316
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:50,435
<i>You shall have</i>
<i>as many ships as you require.</i>

317
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:52,537
And what do you ask
in return?

318
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:56,774
All we ask is that
you make use of these ships.

319
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,310
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

320
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:02,213
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

321
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:07,486
I have a gift
for you as well.

322
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:10,889
- Your life.
- My life?

323
00:24:10,923 --> 00:24:12,624
And the lives
of your wise masters.

324
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,228
But I also want
something in return.

325
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:19,832
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

326
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:22,935
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

327
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:24,770
clothing, and property
as they can carry

328
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:28,107
as payment
for their years of servitude.

329
00:24:28,141 --> 00:24:30,175
Reject this gift,

330
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,577
and I shall
show you no mercy.

331
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,613
You are mad.

332
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,448
<i>We are not Astapor</i>
<i>or Qarth.</i>

333
00:24:36,482 --> 00:24:39,684
We are Yunkai and we have
powerful friends.

334
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:43,455
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

335
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:46,458
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

336
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,827
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

337
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,598
You swore me
safe conduct.

338
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:57,502
I did, but my dragons
made no promises.

339
00:24:57,536 --> 00:25:00,071
And you threatened
their mother.

340
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:02,274
Take the gold.

341
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:14,786
My gold.
You gave it to me, remember?

342
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,588
And I shall put it
to good use.

343
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:19,457
You'd be wise to do the same
with my gift to you.

344
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:21,193
Now get out.

345
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,866
The Yunkish
are a proud people.

346
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,468
They will not bend.

347
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:32,471
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

348
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,540
He said he had
powerful friends.

349
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:36,375
Who was he talking about?

350
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,677
I don't know.

351
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,113
Find out.

352
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,564
Chains?

353
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,835
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

354
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:04,038
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

355
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:06,473
Golden chains.

356
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:10,111
You could buy
a ship with these.

357
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:11,879
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

358
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:15,717
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not going anywhere.

359
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:19,854
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

360
00:26:21,557 --> 00:26:24,325
I didn't ask
for this marriage.

361
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,862
- I didn't want it.
- No?

362
00:26:26,896 --> 00:26:29,198
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

363
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,267
That doesn't mean that--

364
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:33,502
this is duty,
not desire.

365
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,105
Is that what you will tell yourself
when you fuck her?

366
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,241
I don't have a choice.
My father--

367
00:26:38,276 --> 00:26:40,877
Does not rule
the world.

368
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:46,617
We can still go
across the Narrow Sea.

369
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,485
What would I do there?

370
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,253
Juggle?

371
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:53,390
I am a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

372
00:26:53,424 --> 00:26:56,025
And I'm Shae
the funny whore.

373
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,929
My feelings for you
have not changed.

374
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:03,165
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

375
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,434
While I empty
her chamber pot

376
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:07,236
and lick your cock
when you're bored?

377
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,771
I swear to you
it will not be like that.

378
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:12,607
No?
What will it be like?

379
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,012
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

380
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:20,215
You will have
fine clothes,

381
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:23,018
guards to keep
you safe, servants.

382
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:27,490
Any children
we might have

383
00:27:27,524 --> 00:27:29,458
will be
well provided for.

384
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:31,860
Children?
You think I want children

385
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:33,529
who can never see
their father?

386
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:35,130
Who would be killed
in their sleep

387
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:37,466
if their grandfather
found out about them?

388
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,367
Listen.

389
00:27:39,402 --> 00:27:41,669
Listen to me, my lady.

390
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:44,038
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

391
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:47,308
You'll always
be my lady.

392
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,547
I'm your whore.

393
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:56,917
And when you are tired
of fucking me,

394
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,052
I will be nothing.

395
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:31,484
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

396
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,654
I should have been here.

397
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,558
After all the running
and fighting,

398
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,461
here I am,
back where I started.

399
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:43,730
Do you miss it?

400
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,732
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

401
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,669
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.

402
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:53,272
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

403
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:55,074
Your talent for fighting?

404
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,609
I'm lowborn.

405
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:58,878
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

406
00:28:58,912 --> 00:29:00,746
Mine was a slave.

407
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,782
So was I.

408
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:04,818
Bought and sold,

409
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:06,820
scourged and branded,

410
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:09,122
until the Lord of Light
reached down,

411
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:11,257
took me in his hand
and raised me up.

412
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:14,661
I was born in Flea Bottom.

413
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:17,130
Your blood is noble.

414
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,435
Are you saying my father,

415
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,971
he was some lord or...

416
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:25,272
There.

417
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,541
Your father's house.

418
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:35,950
I'm just a bastard.

419
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:41,256
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

420
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,558
First of His Name,
King of the Andals

421
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,360
and the First Men.

422
00:29:45,394 --> 00:29:49,064
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

423
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:53,234
There is power
in a king's blood.

424
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,584
Come sit
by the fire, child.

425
00:30:14,321 --> 00:30:15,721
Not talking, eh?

426
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:17,924
That's a first.

427
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:20,292
I don't talk
to traitors.

428
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,463
I didn't like
giving up the boy.

429
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:26,165
But you did.

430
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,368
You took the gold
and you gave him up.

431
00:30:30,436 --> 00:30:33,405
The Red God
is the one true god.

432
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,874
You've seen his power.

433
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:38,109
When he commands,
we obey.

434
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:42,146
He's not
my one true god.

435
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,683
No?
Who's yours?

436
00:30:48,153 --> 00:30:49,954
Death.

437
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,668
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

438
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:05,171
- How many?
- <i>No more than 20.</i>

439
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:07,841
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

440
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:13,447
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

441
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:15,517
Yeah!

442
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:18,687
But what about Riverrun?

443
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:20,555
It's not south.
It's west of here.

444
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,791
It will still be west of here
two days from now.

445
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,961
- You swore.
- To take you home, and I will.

446
00:31:25,995 --> 00:31:28,163
But we need
to do this first.

447
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:30,065
Why? So you can
steal their gold?

448
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,633
I swear to you,
this isn't--

449
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:34,303
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

450
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:35,971
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

451
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:39,375
You'll lie to anyone.
I hope the Lannisters kill you all.

452
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:42,445
One day you'll understand,
but now--

453
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:47,984
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

454
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:14,276
Kick all you like,
wolf girl.

455
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,779
Won't do you no good.

456
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:35,964
I thought you were gone.

457
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,133
Tomorrow.

458
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,472
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

459
00:32:46,074 --> 00:32:49,043
Lord Bolton's traveling
tomorrow as well.

460
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:52,213
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

461
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:54,649
You're to remain here.

462
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,152
With Locke?

463
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:06,129
I owe you a debt.

464
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:11,934
When Catelyn Stark
released you,

465
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:14,671
we both made
a promise to her.

466
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:16,672
<i>Now it's your promise.</i>

467
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:19,408
You gave your word.

468
00:33:19,442 --> 00:33:21,009
Keep it

469
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:24,012
and consider
the debt paid.

470
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:28,082
I will return the Stark
girls to their mother.

471
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:31,352
I swear it.

472
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:39,327
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

473
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:01,485
Here.
Let me.

474
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:10,795
It will take time.

475
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:18,569
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

476
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:20,338
<i>to give him back</i>
<i>his chain.</i>

477
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:22,240
My father will make him
Grand Maester

478
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,742
if he grows me
a new hand.

479
00:34:24,777 --> 00:34:28,680
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

480
00:34:30,382 --> 00:34:33,752
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

481
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:36,955
The Lannisters send
their regards.

482
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:44,230
Safe journey,
Kingslayer.

483
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:46,533
Nothing to say?

484
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,969
I liked you
better before.

485
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,305
I don't remember chopping
your balls off, too.

486
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,241
And don't you worry
about your friend.

487
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:58,411
We'll take
good care of her.

488
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,897
Shh.

489
00:35:42,621 --> 00:35:44,088
Gentle, my lord.

490
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:46,323
Gentle.

491
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,902
Shh shh shh.

492
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:00,605
Myranda knows
what she's doing.

493
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,307
Let her.

494
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:05,610
She trained
as a septa, only...

495
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:09,914
she had other urges.

496
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:13,785
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

497
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:16,855
Where is he?

498
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:18,389
Who, my lord?

499
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:21,960
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

500
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:24,562
Please.

501
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:26,798
Don't you want us
to see it?

502
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:28,867
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.

503
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:31,136
Everybody talks about it.

504
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,173
He sent you.

505
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:35,707
Who sent us?

506
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:37,810
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy.

507
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:39,779
We heard so much
about it.

508
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:44,117
- Please.
- Oh!

509
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,687
There it is.

510
00:36:47,989 --> 00:36:50,424
Oh.

511
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,127
Do you think
we're ugly?

512
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,195
He thinks we're ugly.

513
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,131
Well, he's been
through so much.

514
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:59,567
Look at his poor face.

515
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:02,570
Help me.

516
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:06,073
If he comes back...

517
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:10,912
We need to make him
feel better.

518
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:13,915
And how can we make
him feel better?

519
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:16,651
I have an idea.

520
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:39,808
Oh, she's shy.

521
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:43,845
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

522
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:48,049
Maybe he doesn't
know how we are.

523
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:01,662
Oh.

524
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,631
I felt something.

525
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:09,771
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

526
00:38:12,274 --> 00:38:14,743
- As good as they say?
- Mmm.

527
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:26,788
And why should you
get all the fun?

528
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:39,968
What?
You like her better?

529
00:38:43,774 --> 00:38:45,808
Plenty there
for both of us.

530
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:50,012
I was here first.

531
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,454
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

532
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:02,556
Terrible timing.

533
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,261
But I was getting jealous.

534
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:13,967
Well?

535
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:17,538
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

536
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,587
Everyone knows
you love girls.

537
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:36,558
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

538
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:49,173
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

539
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:53,177
Would you say it's
your most precious part?

540
00:39:56,281 --> 00:39:59,517
Please.

541
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:02,486
No.

542
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:04,589
<i>No!</i>
<i>Mercy, please!</i>

543
00:40:04,623 --> 00:40:06,591
<i>Please, mercy!</i>
<i>Mercy!</i>

544
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,394
This is mercy.

545
00:40:09,428 --> 00:40:11,629
I'm not killing you.

546
00:40:11,664 --> 00:40:15,734
<i>Just making</i>
<i>a few alterations.</i>

547
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:20,339
No! No! No!

548
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:22,175
Please, no! No!

549
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:25,578
No! No, please!
Please!

550
00:40:28,381 --> 00:40:29,815
You're gonna scare it off.

551
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,718
I'm not gonna scare it.
I'm gonna kill it.

552
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,121
It's too far away.

553
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,211
Is that a palace?

554
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:05,682
It's a windmill.

555
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,452
Windmill.

556
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:11,989
Who built it?
Some king?

557
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:14,358
Just the men
who used to live here.

558
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,993
<i>They must have been</i>
<i>great builders,</i>

559
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:18,262
<i>stacking stones so high.</i>

560
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:21,365
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

561
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:24,301
"I'm Jon Snow
and I'm from Winterfell.

562
00:41:24,335 --> 00:41:25,502
My daddy
was a fancy lord

563
00:41:25,537 --> 00:41:28,472
and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

564
00:41:28,506 --> 00:41:30,475
If you're impressed
by a windmill,

565
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:33,478
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

566
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:35,347
What's swooning?

567
00:41:35,381 --> 00:41:37,182
Fainting.

568
00:41:37,217 --> 00:41:39,751
What's fainting?

569
00:41:42,522 --> 00:41:44,623
When a girl sees blood
and collapses.

570
00:41:44,658 --> 00:41:46,826
Why would a girl
see blood and collapse?

571
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,695
Well...

572
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,930
not all girls
are like you.

573
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,134
Well, girls see
more blood than boys.

574
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:59,237
Or do you like girls
who swoon, Jon Snow?

575
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:01,005
Oh, a spider!

576
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,574
Save me, Jon Snow.

577
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,910
My dress is made
of the purest silk

578
00:42:05,944 --> 00:42:08,312
from Tralalalaleeday.

579
00:42:08,346 --> 00:42:10,914
I'd like to see you
in a silk dress.

580
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:15,552
Would you?

581
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:20,558
So I could
tear it off you.

582
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:23,527
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress,

583
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:25,696
I'll blacken your eye.

584
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:35,472
Maybe one day
I'll take you to Winterfell.

585
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:39,443
Or maybe one day
I'll take you there.

586
00:42:39,477 --> 00:42:41,778
After we've taken
our land back.

587
00:42:44,949 --> 00:42:46,583
Ygritte.

588
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,823
You won't win.

589
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,660
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

590
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:58,897
- You know nothing--
- Six times in the last thousand years,

591
00:42:58,932 --> 00:43:01,200
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

592
00:43:01,234 --> 00:43:04,871
- Six times they failed.
- And how do you know that?

593
00:43:04,905 --> 00:43:06,806
Every boy in the North
knows it.

594
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:08,275
We grow up learning it.

595
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:09,676
Where the battles
were fought,

596
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,444
the names of the heroes,
who died where.

597
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,346
Six times you've invaded

598
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,549
and six times
you've failed.

599
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,584
The seventh
will be the same.

600
00:43:18,618 --> 00:43:21,820
- Mance is different.
- You don't have the discipline.

601
00:43:21,854 --> 00:43:25,423
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

602
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:26,858
You don't know
how to fight together.

603
00:43:26,892 --> 00:43:29,394
- You don't know that.
- I do.

604
00:43:29,428 --> 00:43:31,195
I know it.

605
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:33,564
If you attack the Wall,
you'll die.

606
00:43:33,598 --> 00:43:35,499
All of you.

607
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:45,776
All of <i>us.</i>

608
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,728
You're mine

609
00:44:03,762 --> 00:44:06,297
as I'm yours.

610
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,866
And if we die,
we die.

611
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:12,370
But first we'll live.

612
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:16,374
Yes, first we'll live.

613
00:44:32,825 --> 00:44:35,493
What's he going on about?

614
00:44:35,528 --> 00:44:37,896
And how come he always
gets to sit and chat

615
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,998
while we do all the work?

616
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:44,570
Hodor.

617
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:49,776
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

618
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,511
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

619
00:44:51,545 --> 00:44:53,512
You think I can't
hear you every day?

620
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:55,181
Filling his head
with black magic.

621
00:44:55,215 --> 00:44:58,217
<i>Talking about visions</i>
<i>and three-eyed ravens and worse.</i>

622
00:44:58,252 --> 00:45:01,087
- Leave him alone.
- He can speak for himself.

623
00:45:01,122 --> 00:45:02,822
I don't fill his head
with anything.

624
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:05,391
<i>So what do you</i>
<i>talk about?</i>

625
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:08,527
What's happening to him
and what that means.

626
00:45:08,562 --> 00:45:11,129
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.

627
00:45:11,164 --> 00:45:12,731
It's not like that.

628
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:14,532
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>tell him all the answers.</i>

629
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:16,935
<i>It would be much easier.</i>

630
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:19,737
I don't want you
talking to him anymore.

631
00:45:19,772 --> 00:45:21,239
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

632
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:24,208
- We're not going to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

633
00:45:24,242 --> 00:45:27,744
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn't there.

634
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:29,479
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

635
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:31,148
Oh, no.
I'm not going back there.

636
00:45:31,182 --> 00:45:34,251
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

637
00:45:35,987 --> 00:45:37,788
Look at me.

638
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:41,091
The raven's
been coming to me

639
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:43,494
ever since I fell
from that tower.

640
00:45:43,528 --> 00:45:46,297
He wants me
to find him.

641
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:49,700
I don't have
my legs anymore.

642
00:45:49,735 --> 00:45:51,636
This is what I have now.

643
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,838
You have a family.

644
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:55,706
You need to go back
to Castle Black

645
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:58,509
so you can get back to them
where you belong.

646
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:01,513
What if I belong
in the North?

647
00:46:01,547 --> 00:46:05,850
What if I fell from
that tower for a reason?

648
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:08,086
Is that what
he's telling you?

649
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,288
That it's all
for a reason?

650
00:46:10,322 --> 00:46:14,526
All these bad things happened because
the gods got big plans for you?

651
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,528
I wish it were true,
little lord.

652
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:20,733
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

653
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:23,035
You don't understand.
You don't know.

654
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,037
You don't know.
None of you know.

655
00:46:25,071 --> 00:46:27,306
None of you
have been up there.

656
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,744
I had a man once.

657
00:46:32,778 --> 00:46:34,513
A good man.

658
00:46:34,547 --> 00:46:36,315
Bruni, his name was.

659
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,352
I was his
and he was mine.

660
00:46:39,386 --> 00:46:42,354
But one night
Bruni disappears.

661
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:44,990
People said he left me,

662
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:46,358
but I knew him.

663
00:46:46,392 --> 00:46:50,328
<i>He'd never leave me.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>

664
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:52,731
I knew he'd come back.

665
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,501
And he did.

666
00:46:57,737 --> 00:47:00,906
<i>He came in through</i>
<i>the back of the hut.</i>

667
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:03,743
Only it wasn't Bruni.

668
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:06,345
Not really.

669
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,916
His skin was pale

670
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,319
like a dead man's.

671
00:47:13,354 --> 00:47:16,189
His eyes bluer
than clear sky.

672
00:47:19,928 --> 00:47:21,696
<i>He came at me,</i>

673
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,698
grabbed me by the neck

674
00:47:23,732 --> 00:47:26,568
and squeezed so hard

675
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:29,438
I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

676
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:34,176
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I got the knife.</i>

677
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,113
<i>When I did, I stuck it</i>

678
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,849
deep into his heart.

679
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,788
And he hardly
seemed to notice.

680
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:51,494
<i>I had to burn our hut down</i>
<i>with him inside.</i>

681
00:47:53,897 --> 00:47:56,632
I didn't ask the gods
what it meant.

682
00:47:56,666 --> 00:48:00,402
I didn't need to.
I already knew.

683
00:48:00,437 --> 00:48:03,605
<i>It meant the North</i>
<i>was no place for men to be.</i>

684
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,908
<i>Not anymore.</i>

685
00:48:08,245 --> 00:48:10,480
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black

686
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,082
and no further.

687
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:23,225
How is the pain,
my lord?

688
00:48:26,228 --> 00:48:29,330
What's the purpose
of an arm with no hand?

689
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:35,869
Well, we've stymied
the corruption.

690
00:48:35,904 --> 00:48:38,706
Yes, we've stymied
the corruption.

691
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,808
You're a learned man.

692
00:48:40,842 --> 00:48:42,443
All the good
it's done me.

693
00:48:42,477 --> 00:48:44,645
You did well
sewing up this mess.

694
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,014
You're far better
at this sort of work

695
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,717
than Grand Maester
Pycelle.

696
00:48:49,752 --> 00:48:52,353
Faint praise, my lord.

697
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:57,192
So why did the Citadel
take your chain?

698
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,193
Did you fondle
one boy too many?

699
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:02,497
No, my lord.
That's not my weakness.

700
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:06,267
What is?

701
00:49:08,537 --> 00:49:10,071
Curiosity.

702
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:14,075
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

703
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:16,377
And the only way
to understand it

704
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,780
is to study the afflicted.

705
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:21,483
You performed experiments
on living men.

706
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:23,385
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

707
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,456
My studies
have given me insight

708
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,158
that has saved
many lives.

709
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:30,560
Dying paupers,
I assume.

710
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:34,163
Men with no families
to complain.

711
00:49:34,198 --> 00:49:35,999
You found them moaning
in the poorhouse

712
00:49:36,033 --> 00:49:38,468
and had them carted
back to your garret

713
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:41,771
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

714
00:49:41,806 --> 00:49:44,240
How many men have
you killed, my lord?

715
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:45,909
I don't know.

716
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:49,079
50? 100?

717
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:52,917
Countless.

718
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:54,953
Countless has
a nice ring to it.

719
00:49:54,987 --> 00:49:57,289
And how many lives
have you saved?

720
00:49:57,323 --> 00:50:00,158
Half a million.

721
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,595
The population
of King's Landing.

722
00:50:08,702 --> 00:50:12,204
You were in charge
of the ravens at Harrenhal.

723
00:50:12,238 --> 00:50:16,441
Did you-- did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

724
00:50:16,476 --> 00:50:19,077
A bird flew off
and a bird flew back.

725
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:22,680
Lord Selwyn Tarth

726
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:26,417
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.

727
00:50:26,452 --> 00:50:30,288
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

728
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,859
Why not?

729
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:35,260
He's convinced Lord Tarth

730
00:50:35,295 --> 00:50:37,996
owns all the sapphire
mines in Westeros.

731
00:50:39,432 --> 00:50:41,734
He feels
he's being cheated.

732
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:43,937
They'd be fools
to kill her.

733
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:46,406
These men have been
at war a long time.

734
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:48,608
Most of them
will be dead by winter.

735
00:50:48,643 --> 00:50:51,578
She'll be their
entertainment tonight.

736
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:53,847
Beyond tonight,

737
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:56,149
I don't think
they care very much.

738
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:17,704
We have to return
to Harrenhal.

739
00:51:17,738 --> 00:51:19,171
Why?

740
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:20,673
I've left
something behind.

741
00:51:20,707 --> 00:51:22,308
Absolutely not.

742
00:51:22,342 --> 00:51:24,310
I've got orders
from Lord Bolton.

743
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:25,878
And what are those orders?

744
00:51:25,912 --> 00:51:29,415
To deliver you to your father
at King's Landing.

745
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:31,684
You think you'll get
a reward.

746
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,488
I serve Lord Bolton.

747
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:38,056
Any appreciation
your father--

748
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,424
You think
you're getting a reward.

749
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:40,758
Let me explain
something to you.

750
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:42,793
When my father sees me,
the first thing

751
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:45,195
he's going to ask
is what happened to my hand.

752
00:51:45,229 --> 00:51:48,078
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

753
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:48,818
I had nothing--

754
00:51:48,843 --> 00:51:51,693
Or I could tell him
this man saved my life.

755
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:56,607
We return
to Harrenhal now.

756
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:18,161
Whoa.

757
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:22,066
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

758
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:30,275
<i>♪ The bear, the bear</i>
<i>and the maiden fair ♪</i>

759
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:32,344
<i>♪ From there to here,</i>
<i>from here to there ♪</i>

760
00:52:32,378 --> 00:52:34,713
<i>♪ All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered in hair ♪</i>

761
00:52:34,747 --> 00:52:37,115
♪ He smelled that girl
in the summer air ♪

762
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,351
♪ The bear, the bear,
and the maiden fair! ♪

763
00:52:43,823 --> 00:52:45,857
<i>Don't spare her.</i>

764
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:48,426
<i>Don't spare her!</i>

765
00:52:50,129 --> 00:52:53,698
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

766
00:52:53,733 --> 00:52:55,366
Stop running and fight.

767
00:53:02,108 --> 00:53:04,443
A wooden sword?

768
00:53:04,478 --> 00:53:07,280
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

769
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:09,082
We've only got
one bear.

770
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:10,750
I'll pay
her bloody ransom.

771
00:53:10,784 --> 00:53:12,752
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want.

772
00:53:12,786 --> 00:53:14,387
Just get her
out of there.

773
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:16,789
All you lords and ladies

774
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:19,725
still think that the only thing
that matters is gold.

775
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:23,162
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

776
00:53:23,196 --> 00:53:26,265
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

777
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:28,701
So go buy yourself
a golden hand

778
00:53:28,735 --> 00:53:31,370
and fuck yourself
with it.

779
00:53:41,781 --> 00:53:43,916
Ah!

780
00:53:50,256 --> 00:53:51,790
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

781
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:05,136
What the fuck are you
doing to my bear?

782
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,071
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

783
00:54:07,105 --> 00:54:10,140
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

784
00:54:13,644 --> 00:54:15,578
Pull her up.

785
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:30,692
Hold my legs.

786
00:54:53,381 --> 00:54:55,149
Pull him up!

787
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,562
The bitch stays.

788
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,066
We're taking her
to King's Landing.

789
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,734
Unless you kill me.

790
00:55:16,238 --> 00:55:17,972
She belongs to me.

791
00:55:18,006 --> 00:55:20,908
Lord Bolton's orders.

792
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,711
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

793
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:25,446
Getting his pet rat
a reward

794
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,816
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

795
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:52,108
Well, we must be on our way.

796
00:55:55,646 --> 00:55:57,814
Sorry about the sapphires.
