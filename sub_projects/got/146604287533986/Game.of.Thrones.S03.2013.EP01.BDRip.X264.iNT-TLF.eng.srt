1
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,879
<i>Fall back!</i>

2
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,463
Brother?

3
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,314
Did you send the ravens?

4
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:34,721
Tarly, look at me.

5
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,392
Did you send the ravens?

6
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,931
<i>That was your job.</i>

7
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,734
Your only job.

8
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:58,912
We need to get
back to the Wall.

9
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,581
<i>It's a long march.</i>

10
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,350
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

11
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:08,154
but we have to make it,
have to warn them

12
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,024
or before winter's done,

13
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,226
everyone you've ever known

14
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,061
will be dead.

15
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,670
First time you've seen
a giant, Jon Snow?

16
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,310
Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

17
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,949
When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

18
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,118
And when they're angry,

19
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:27,255
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

20
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,290
like a hammer on a nail.

21
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:41,602
<i>- Crow!</i>
<i>- Crow!</i>

22
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:44,739
<i>- Look over there!</i>
<i>- Crow!</i>

23
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,607
<i>Crow! Look over here!</i>
<i>Look!</i>

24
00:06:47,642 --> 00:06:50,777
<i>Ah, look, crow coming!</i>

25
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,513
<i>Crow!</i>

26
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,917
You're wearing
the wrong color.

27
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:59,453
Mance was a ranger.

28
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:04,592
In your hearts, all you
crows want to fly free.

29
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:06,527
When I'm free,
will I be free to go?

30
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:07,562
- Crow!
- Crow!

31
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:08,897
Sure, you will.

32
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:12,132
Oh!

33
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:15,036
And I'll be free
to kill you.

34
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:18,672
<i>Got no respect, this lot.</i>

35
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:21,876
Got no fathers to slap 'em
when they're foul.

36
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,245
What happened
to their fathers?

37
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:28,516
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

38
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,987
Don't look so grim,
Jon Snow.

39
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,057
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

40
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:38,960
And if he don't...

41
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,184
I smell a crow.

42
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:05,419
We killed his friends.

43
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:07,255
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

44
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:10,392
What do we want
with a baby crow?

45
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:13,362
This baby killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

46
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:16,598
<i>He wants to be</i>
<i>one of us.</i>

47
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:25,307
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

48
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:27,743
Friends twice your size.

49
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:33,315
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

50
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,819
<i>if you put a sword</i>
<i>through their hearts.</i>

51
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,688
Plenty of little men

52
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,658
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

53
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:45,460
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

54
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:47,162
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

55
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:52,234
- <i>What's your name, boy?</i>
- Jon Snow.

56
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:00,443
Your Grace.

57
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:05,181
Your Grace?

58
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,883
Did you hear that?

59
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,986
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

60
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,422
Stand, boy.

61
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,561
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

62
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:26,436
So, you're
Ned Stark's bastard.

63
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,604
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

64
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,308
You can leave us.

65
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:41,618
The girl likes you.

66
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,820
You like her back, Snow?

67
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:46,223
That why you want
to join us?

68
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:48,025
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

69
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,261
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

70
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:52,497
where we make you
swear off girls.

71
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:56,200
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

72
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:58,670
Can't believe this pup

73
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,005
<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>

74
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,240
He was our enemy

75
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:06,143
and I'm glad he's dead.

76
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,621
He was my brother once.

77
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:21,324
Back when he had
a whole hand.

78
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:24,861
What were you
doing with him?

79
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,198
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

80
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:30,066
Why?

81
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,868
He wants me to lead
one day.

82
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:35,372
But here you are,
a traitor

83
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:37,874
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

84
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:41,478
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

85
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:52,089
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

86
00:10:58,062 --> 00:11:00,030
I want to be free.

87
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:03,200
No, I don't think so.

88
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:06,403
I think what you want
most of all

89
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:08,638
is to be a hero.

90
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:12,576
I'll ask you
one last time--

91
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:15,645
why do you want
to join us?

92
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:23,686
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

93
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:27,590
I saw...

94
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:29,191
You saw what?

95
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,562
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

96
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:36,331
and leave it
in the woods.

97
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:38,633
I saw what took it.

98
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:46,275
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

99
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:51,615
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

100
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,718
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

101
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:56,753
he already knew.

102
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:01,358
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

103
00:12:01,392 --> 00:12:04,728
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

104
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:08,732
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

105
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:14,004
Did I come
to the right place?

106
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:21,544
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

107
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,868
What if you took off
that bit there?

108
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:50,607
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

109
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:54,543
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

110
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:59,715
I want you to take it off.

111
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,889
Mouth.

112
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,663
Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.

113
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,534
I didn't hear that.

114
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:22,569
- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>

115
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,539
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

116
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:29,209
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

117
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,212
I will murder you, boy.

118
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,714
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

119
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:54,732
- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>

120
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,337
<i>The queen.</i>

121
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,386
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

122
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,589
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

123
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,458
No, I don't think so.

124
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:20,194
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

125
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,896
I'd let a wooden door
stop me?

126
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:30,404
They stay outside.

127
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:32,673
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

128
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:51,091
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

129
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:54,696
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

130
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,166
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

131
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,569
I should hope so.

132
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:03,905
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

133
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,007
Thanks to Father.

134
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:08,510
Thanks to Father.

135
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,114
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

136
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:14,683
No? Curious.

137
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:18,520
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

138
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,756
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

139
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,759
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

140
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:27,096
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

141
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,897
You're meeting
Father today?

142
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:31,000
How do you know that?

143
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:33,870
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

144
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:37,406
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

145
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:42,044
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

146
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,712
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

147
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:46,248
Do I need
to want something?

148
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:50,918
I'm sure
he loves me dearly,

149
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,653
as any father loves
his child,

150
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:55,356
his baby boy.

151
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,458
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

152
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,126
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

153
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,262
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

154
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,832
but Father never came.

155
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,405
You're going
to make me cry.

156
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,807
Why do you care
what I want from him?

157
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,311
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

158
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,579
Slandered?
When?

159
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,848
<i>You told him</i>
<i>I had my guards</i>

160
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,749
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

161
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,618
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

162
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,886
A girl of nine,
I believe.

163
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,721
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

164
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,789
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

165
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,224
If I remember correctly,

166
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,493
she never stole
a necklace again.

167
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,098
It's not slander
if it's true.

168
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,834
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

169
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,602
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

170
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,871
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

171
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,973
Because you're a liar.

172
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,077
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

173
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,580
Any lies in particular?

174
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,751
You're a clever man,

175
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,054
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

176
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:04,124
Still makes me
more clever than you.

177
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:10,931
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

178
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:14,434
Ser Taryn Mant and...

179
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,203
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

180
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,604
Ser Meryn Trant.

181
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,174
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

182
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,810
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

183
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:24,278
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater

184
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,213
was anointed
by the king himself.

185
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:28,949
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

186
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:30,585
nothing more.

187
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,554
That's exactly who I am.

188
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,355
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

189
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,659
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

190
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:40,462
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

191
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:43,332
You put your hand
on that door,

192
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,968
you lose the hand.

193
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:04,486
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

194
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:06,655
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

195
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,790
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

196
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,124
You're here to protect me.

197
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,360
I've been doing that
for a while now.

198
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:14,162
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

199
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,663
I grow poor
protecting you.

200
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:17,598
Poor?
Poor?

201
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,700
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

202
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,802
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

203
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:24,572
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

204
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,674
And now my pockets
are empty.

205
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,043
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

206
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:31,079
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

207
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:32,447
you'll need to pay more.

208
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:34,949
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

209
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:37,752
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

210
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:39,553
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

211
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:41,021
- How much?
- Double.

212
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:43,223
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

213
00:18:43,258 --> 00:18:44,691
Knights
are worth double.

214
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:47,094
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

215
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:49,196
Which means
you can afford it.

216
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,768
Here. Here!

217
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,580
Help me!

218
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,539
Who are you?

219
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:11,280
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

220
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,319
I was a captain
and a knight.

221
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:20,223
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

222
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,566
The one true king
of Westeros--

223
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,270
Stannis Baratheon.

224
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:44,447
I thought you were dead.

225
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:47,116
Everyone thought
you were dead.

226
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:52,688
And your son?

227
00:20:58,461 --> 00:21:00,863
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

228
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:03,933
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

229
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:16,678
I'm so sorry,
my friend.

230
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:19,248
I, too, have lost a son.

231
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:21,650
There is nothing worse
in this world.

232
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:26,554
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

233
00:21:26,588 --> 00:21:30,124
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

234
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,728
Stannis lives?

235
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:36,964
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

236
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:38,765
Will you take me there?

237
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,201
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

238
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:42,702
This war is not over.

239
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:44,070
Not for you, maybe.

240
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,840
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

241
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,875
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

242
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,378
I am sworn to no man.

243
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:55,215
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

244
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:56,750
I delivered the ships.

245
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:58,953
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

246
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:01,389
- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

247
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:03,892
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

248
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:05,561
They say he sees no one--

249
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,830
not his generals,
not even his wife.

250
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:10,867
Only the Red Woman

251
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:12,268
whispering in his ear,

252
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:15,137
telling him what
she sees in the flames

253
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:16,806
and burning men alive.

254
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,274
What?

255
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:21,811
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

256
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:24,747
All those who spoke
against her she called

257
00:22:24,781 --> 00:22:27,383
servants of darkness.

258
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:31,887
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

259
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,194
I'm a pirate.

260
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:40,529
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

261
00:22:40,564 --> 00:22:42,231
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

262
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:45,534
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

263
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:47,835
Take me back there, please.

264
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,770
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

265
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:52,439
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

266
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:54,074
You could try.

267
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,477
If you fail,
they will burn you.

268
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:59,380
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

269
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:01,549
And you've only
just come back to life.

270
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,818
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

271
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:06,587
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

272
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:09,089
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

273
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:11,025
but I don't ask you
for favors.

274
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,660
I have to stop her.

275
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:15,830
Please, do this for me.

276
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:21,036
When you are dead,

277
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,505
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

278
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:26,642
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

279
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,858
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

280
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:45,661
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

281
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:47,196
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

282
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,097
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

283
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:51,300
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

284
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:54,036
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

285
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:56,873
I don't think
we're going to get one.

286
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:49,194
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

287
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:52,265
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

288
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:55,101
For them
and for your sons.

289
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:57,303
Will it?

290
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,671
They rot in the ground

291
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:01,907
<i>while their killer</i>
<i>runs free.</i>

292
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:04,876
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

293
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:07,746
My best hunters
are after him.

294
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:30,402
<i>- A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

295
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:32,971
My father's bannerman.

296
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,195
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

297
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:09,909
<i>She's your mother.</i>

298
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,578
She freed
Jaime Lannister.

299
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,981
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

300
00:26:15,015 --> 00:26:16,783
and she robbed them
of their justice.

301
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:20,086
<i>Water.</i>

302
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,923
Water.

303
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,192
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

304
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,934
What's your name, friend?

305
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,835
Qyburn.

306
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,237
You're lucky to be alive.

307
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:41,976
Lucky?

308
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:09,941
The badge
looks good on you.

309
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:14,412
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

310
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:19,784
Are you enjoying
your new position?

311
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:22,954
Am I enjoying it?

312
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:25,390
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

313
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,458
Yes.

314
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:29,460
I heard how happy you were.

315
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,964
You brought a whore
into my bed.

316
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:36,600
It wasn't your bed
at the time.

317
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:41,972
I sent you here
to advise the king.

318
00:27:42,006 --> 00:27:46,042
I gave you real power
and authority.

319
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:48,411
You chose
to spend your days

320
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,613
as you always have,

321
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:53,082
bedding harlots

322
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:55,484
and drinking with thieves.

323
00:27:57,487 --> 00:28:00,289
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

324
00:28:00,323 --> 00:28:02,691
What do you want, Tyrion?

325
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:05,728
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

326
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:08,664
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

327
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:12,301
My beloved father who

328
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:15,037
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

329
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:16,905
after he fell
on the battlefield.

330
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,509
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

331
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:23,545
I organized
the defense of this city

332
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,748
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

333
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:29,516
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

334
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,819
while your grandson,
the king,

335
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:34,488
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

336
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:38,125
I bled in the mud
for our family.

337
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:40,628
And as my reward,

338
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:43,998
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

339
00:28:44,032 --> 00:28:46,033
But what do I want?

340
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:49,503
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

341
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:52,773
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

342
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:55,243
You are a Lannister.

343
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:58,312
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

344
00:28:58,347 --> 00:29:01,049
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

345
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,050
Hmm?

346
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:06,887
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

347
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:09,289
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

348
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:14,094
So tell me what you want.

349
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,802
I want what is mine
by right.

350
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:25,841
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

351
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:30,180
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

352
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:32,249
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

353
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:36,052
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

354
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:39,155
I am your son
and lawful heir.

355
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:43,760
You want Casterly Rock?

356
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:45,762
It is mine by right.

357
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:52,436
We'll find you
accommodations

358
00:29:52,471 --> 00:29:54,372
more suited
to your name

359
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:56,774
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

360
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:59,677
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

361
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,381
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

362
00:30:03,415 --> 00:30:05,082
<i>fit for your talents</i>

363
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:07,652
so that you can
serve your family

364
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,787
and protect our legacy.

365
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:11,456
<i>And if you serve</i>
<i>faithfully,</i>

366
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,025
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

367
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:17,895
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

368
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,197
<i>before mocking</i>
<i>the family name</i>

369
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:22,167
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

370
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:26,570
- Why?
- Why?

371
00:30:26,604 --> 00:30:28,739
You ask that?

372
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:32,175
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

373
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,346
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

374
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:40,384
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

375
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:42,986
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

376
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:47,624
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

377
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,695
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

378
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:55,131
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

379
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:59,069
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

380
00:30:59,103 --> 00:31:00,804
But neither gods nor men

381
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:03,740
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

382
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:06,876
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

383
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:09,779
Go, now.

384
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,686
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

385
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:20,890
Go.

386
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:32,000
Oh, one more thing.

387
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:37,539
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

388
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:48,285
<i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

389
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,221
<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

390
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:54,725
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

391
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,097
But it's not
coming back.

392
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:03,733
The captain's tired
of risking his life

393
00:32:03,768 --> 00:32:05,936
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

394
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,039
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

395
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:12,610
He's going
to stay in Dorne.

396
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:15,980
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

397
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:19,784
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

398
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:21,787
Don't ruin the game.

399
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:24,557
I told you,
I don't want to play.

400
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:27,693
What about that one there?

401
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,195
That one?

402
00:32:29,229 --> 00:32:31,231
It's going to Volantis.

403
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:32,699
Why?

404
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,434
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

405
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:37,003
it looked like that one.

406
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,839
That's not how
the game works.

407
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,443
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

408
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:44,077
You've got
to invent a story

409
00:32:44,112 --> 00:32:47,547
about where the ship
is going and why.

410
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:50,451
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

411
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:52,519
Because the truth

412
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,089
is always either
terrible or boring.

413
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,892
Lovely day for it.

414
00:32:57,926 --> 00:32:59,828
Watching the ships.

415
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:02,831
Lord Baelish.

416
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:05,901
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa

417
00:33:05,936 --> 00:33:07,570
alone for a moment?

418
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:21,917
I saw your mother
not long ago.

419
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,620
She's very eager
to see you.

420
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,691
And your sister.

421
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:33,328
Arya's alive?

422
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:38,499
You said
you'd take me home.

423
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,902
You said King's Landing
was your home.

424
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,471
You are the property
of the crown.

425
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,872
Stealing you
would be treason.

426
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:48,141
If you were to tell
just one person--

427
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:50,177
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

428
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,145
Because I'm a terrible liar.

429
00:33:52,179 --> 00:33:54,814
You said so yourself.

430
00:33:54,848 --> 00:33:58,017
Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

431
00:34:01,254 --> 00:34:02,788
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

432
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:06,024
that will take me far away
from the capital.

433
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:07,759
When I set sail,

434
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:10,328
I might be able
to take you with me.

435
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:13,364
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

436
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:18,069
You're her handmaiden?

437
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,941
Yes.
And you're his...?

438
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:26,445
I help manage
his affairs.

439
00:34:26,479 --> 00:34:29,882
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

440
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:32,450
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

441
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:34,486
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

442
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,922
from sunrise till sunset.

443
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:41,927
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

444
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:46,265
Yes.

445
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:49,535
Given where we started.

446
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:51,804
And where is that?

447
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:55,340
It's not easy
for girls like us

448
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,543
to dig our way out.

449
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:04,916
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

450
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:07,785
I always do.

451
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,521
Watch out for her
with him.

452
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,912
They're growing fast.

453
00:36:08,116 --> 00:36:09,649
Not fast enough.

454
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:13,087
I can't wait that long.

455
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:17,959
I need an army.

456
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,762
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

457
00:36:23,665 --> 00:36:25,833
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

458
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:28,670
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

459
00:36:28,704 --> 00:36:31,006
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

460
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,874
Do those people
have any better ideas

461
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:36,177
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

462
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,714
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

463
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,052
You're right.

464
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:50,257
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

465
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,058
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

466
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,461
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

467
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,863
They followed me
across the poison water.

468
00:36:56,897 --> 00:36:58,198
If they'll do it,
others will.

469
00:36:58,232 --> 00:36:59,765
And with a true
khalasar--

470
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,903
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

471
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:07,706
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

472
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:09,942
And not before.

473
00:37:37,203 --> 00:37:38,770
Your Grace.

474
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:52,352
I heard you were dead.

475
00:37:52,386 --> 00:37:54,254
Not yet.

476
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,259
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

477
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:02,329
We are alone.

478
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:15,510
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

479
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,413
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

480
00:38:18,447 --> 00:38:21,416
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

481
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,752
And there is still
a war to fight.

482
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:26,487
I am fighting.

483
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:29,157
By burning
prisoners alive?

484
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:33,228
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

485
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:35,698
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

486
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,833
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

487
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,602
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

488
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:43,338
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

489
00:38:47,277 --> 00:38:49,678
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

490
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:53,482
<i>Did I set</i>
<i>your ships ablaze?</i>

491
00:38:56,987 --> 00:39:01,124
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

492
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:05,796
I could have
saved those men.

493
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,464
You would have
taken the city,

494
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:09,373
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

495
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:11,069
and you would
stand beside him.

496
00:39:11,103 --> 00:39:13,638
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

497
00:39:13,672 --> 00:39:17,342
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

498
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:28,553
Do you hear them screaming?

499
00:39:28,587 --> 00:39:31,890
All those burning men
in the water

500
00:39:31,924 --> 00:39:34,592
crying for their mothers,

501
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:37,495
for their gods for help?

502
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:40,264
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

503
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:49,539
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

504
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:51,941
What I told
your son is true.

505
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,343
Death by fire

506
00:39:54,378 --> 00:39:56,079
is the purest death.

507
00:39:57,982 --> 00:40:00,216
This woman is evil!

508
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:01,918
She's the mother of demons.

509
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:04,787
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

510
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:06,322
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

511
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:07,624
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

512
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,526
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

513
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:12,562
<i>Your Grace!</i>

514
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:42,625
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

515
00:40:43,794 --> 00:40:46,696
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

516
00:40:52,804 --> 00:40:54,171
Why have we stopped?

517
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:55,739
It's Lady Margaery,
Your Grace.

518
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:02,913
<i>What is she doing?</i>
<i>Who gave her permission?</i>

519
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:06,850
My lady. We should have
guards, my lady.

520
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:09,253
Why?

521
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,158
Pardon me.

522
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:24,603
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

523
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:26,438
I have others.

524
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:34,646
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

525
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:39,918
No.

526
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:41,686
He was a soldier.

527
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:43,621
He went to fight
on the walls

528
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:46,224
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

529
00:41:46,258 --> 00:41:48,326
He never came back.

530
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,161
And your mother?

531
00:41:50,195 --> 00:41:52,596
She died
when she had me.

532
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:57,435
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

533
00:41:57,469 --> 00:42:01,138
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

534
00:42:07,145 --> 00:42:09,147
Whenever you look
at this knight,

535
00:42:09,181 --> 00:42:12,016
I want you to remember
your father.

536
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:16,486
He wasn't a knight.

537
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:18,455
He was just a soldier.

538
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,857
And what do knights
swear to do?

539
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:24,226
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

540
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:27,996
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

541
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:33,902
Was your father
a soldier, too?

542
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,839
You should be proud, too.

543
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:42,010
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

544
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:44,779
your fathers
saved the city.

545
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:47,115
They saved us all.

546
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:50,519
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

547
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:54,956
All of you.

548
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:03,764
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

549
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:05,866
clothe them,
or house them.

550
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,769
Directly to me.

551
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,686
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

552
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:28,321
Please, sit.
Sit.

553
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,824
I do apologize,
my lady.

554
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,194
Small council meetings.

555
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:35,329
At what point
does it become treason

556
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,231
to waste the king's time?

557
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:43,672
That's a lovely gown,
my lady.

558
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:45,708
Yes, it suits you
perfectly.

559
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:48,144
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

560
00:43:48,178 --> 00:43:51,548
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

561
00:43:51,582 --> 00:43:55,284
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

562
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,787
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

563
00:43:57,822 --> 00:44:01,024
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

564
00:44:01,058 --> 00:44:03,026
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

565
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,163
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

566
00:44:06,197 --> 00:44:09,065
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

567
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,734
I've never seen
anything like it.

568
00:44:10,768 --> 00:44:12,669
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

569
00:44:12,703 --> 00:44:15,305
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

570
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:19,142
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

571
00:44:19,176 --> 00:44:20,944
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

572
00:44:20,978 --> 00:44:25,348
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

573
00:44:25,382 --> 00:44:26,916
the High Septon
told me about.

574
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,631
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

575
00:44:29,653 --> 00:44:33,957
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

576
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:36,260
and approach them
with an open heart.

577
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:38,362
<i>An open heart is what</i>
<i>you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

578
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:39,963
<i>if you're not careful,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

579
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:43,833
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

580
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:46,803
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

581
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:49,806
The king barely escaped
with his life.

582
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,310
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

583
00:44:53,377 --> 00:44:55,913
Facts become less and less
important to her

584
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:57,948
<i>as she grows older.</i>

585
00:44:58,016 --> 00:45:00,918
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

586
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:03,887
You're right, of course.

587
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:07,157
But you are
your father's son.

588
00:45:07,192 --> 00:45:09,359
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

589
00:45:17,536 --> 00:45:19,737
Hunger turns men
into beasts.

590
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:23,608
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

591
00:45:23,643 --> 00:45:27,479
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

592
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:31,016
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

593
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:33,719
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

594
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:35,788
in time of need.

595
00:45:35,822 --> 00:45:37,523
Well, as Ser Loras said,

596
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:40,693
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

597
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:42,661
charitable work before.

598
00:45:43,797 --> 00:45:45,831
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

599
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,235
I'm sure she does.

600
00:46:17,665 --> 00:46:20,467
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

601
00:46:20,502 --> 00:46:22,637
with no food or water.

602
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:30,879
They will stand
until they drop.

603
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:35,116
Such is their
obedience.

604
00:46:37,153 --> 00:46:39,221
They may suit my needs.

605
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,223
Tell me of their training.

606
00:47:01,512 --> 00:47:04,080
They begin their
training at five.

607
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:06,082
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

608
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:08,285
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

609
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,720
the shield,
and the three spears.

610
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:14,358
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

611
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:20,430
<i>Their discipline</i>
<i>and loyalty are absolute.</i>

612
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:22,232
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

613
00:47:22,266 --> 00:47:25,301
Even the bravest men
fear death.

614
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:49,426
<i>My master says</i>
<i>the Unsullied are not men.</i>

615
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,828
Death means nothing
to them.

616
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:03,305
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

617
00:48:17,953 --> 00:48:19,955
Tell the good master
there is no need.

618
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,698
<i>My master points out</i>
<i>that men don't need nipples.</i>

619
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:48,684
To win his shield,

620
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:52,454
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

621
00:48:52,488 --> 00:48:57,459
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

622
00:48:59,796 --> 00:49:02,230
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

623
00:49:02,265 --> 00:49:04,366
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

624
00:49:05,702 --> 00:49:08,504
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

625
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:12,841
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

626
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:29,357
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

627
00:49:29,392 --> 00:49:31,960
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

628
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,068
How many do you
have to sell?

629
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:47,377
8,000.

630
00:49:52,016 --> 00:49:54,652
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

631
00:49:54,686 --> 00:49:57,521
Many other buyers
are interested.

632
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:10,834
8,000 dead babies.

633
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:13,437
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

634
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:15,806
Once I own them,
these men--

635
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:18,375
They're not men.
Not anymore.

636
00:50:18,409 --> 00:50:21,778
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

637
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,880
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

638
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:27,350
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

639
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:42,564
You'll be fair to them.

640
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:45,367
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

641
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,141
You won't order them
to murder babies.

642
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:55,011
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

643
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:57,880
A great injustice
has been done to them.

644
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,584
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

645
00:51:58,373 --> 00:52:00,308
The warlocks.

646
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,649
I owe you my life, ser.

647
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:08,318
The honor is mine,

648
00:52:08,352 --> 00:52:10,553
my queen.

649
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:16,192
You know this man?

650
00:52:16,226 --> 00:52:18,027
I know him

651
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:22,532
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

652
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:24,134
and as the Lord Commander

653
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:26,936
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

654
00:52:28,472 --> 00:52:30,407
King Robert is dead.

655
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:33,310
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

656
00:52:33,344 --> 00:52:35,879
to ask your forgiveness.

657
00:52:35,913 --> 00:52:38,949
I was sworn to protect
your family.

658
00:52:40,685 --> 00:52:42,619
I failed them.

659
00:52:48,026 --> 00:52:50,294
I am Barristan Selmy,

660
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:52,630
Kingsguard to your father.

661
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:55,065
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

662
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,169
and I will not
fail you again.
