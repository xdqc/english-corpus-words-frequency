1
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,997
Lord, cast your light
upon us.

2
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,232
Lord of Light, defend us.

3
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,003
Show us the truth.

4
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:14,404
Strike this man down
if he is guilty.

5
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,906
Give strength to his sword
if he is true.

6
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,043
<i>Lord of Light,</i>
<i>give us wisdom.</i>

7
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,416
For the night is dark

8
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,918
and full of terrors.

9
00:02:29,952 --> 00:02:33,021
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

10
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,549
Get back.

11
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:26,346
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

12
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,115
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

13
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,852
Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.

14
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:34,788
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

15
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:36,256
Kill him!

16
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,938
Lord, cast your light
upon this man, your servant.

17
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,814
Bring him back
from death and darkness.

18
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:00,116
His flame has been
extinguished.

19
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,884
Restore it.

20
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,453
<i>For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

21
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,722
- <i>Lord, cast...</i>
- Arya, don't!

22
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:08,191
Bring him back
from death and darkness...

23
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,960
No!

24
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:13,063
Let go of me!
Let me go!

25
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:16,199
Looks like their god likes me
more than your butcher's boy.

26
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,834
Burn in hell!

27
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,836
<i>He will.</i>

28
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,409
But not today.

29
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,106
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

30
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,708
Tell me what you know.

31
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:57,476
There are four
to a patrol--

32
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:59,378
two builders to check
for structural damage,

33
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:00,846
two rangers to watch
for enemies.

34
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,948
How often do these
patrols go out?

35
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,884
It varies.

36
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,554
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

37
00:06:08,588 --> 00:06:11,057
You'd like to know that.

38
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:15,562
There are 19 castles
guarding the Wall.

39
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,399
How many are manned?

40
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,769
Three.

41
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:24,472
You sure of that?

42
00:06:26,141 --> 00:06:27,742
Which three?

43
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,913
Castle Black.

44
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:33,781
Aye, Castle Black.

45
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:35,916
Everyone knows
Castle Black.

46
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,951
Which others?

47
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,559
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

48
00:06:45,593 --> 00:06:48,495
and the Shadow Tower.

49
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:52,732
How many men remain
in Castle Black?

50
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,501
- 1,000.
- Liar.

51
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:58,672
What happens to your eagle
after I kill you?

52
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:01,241
Does he drift away like a
kite with his strings cut

53
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:03,576
or does he just flop
dead to the ground?

54
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,111
He's no crow.

55
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:07,546
Just 'cause you want him inside
you don't make him one of us.

56
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:10,050
I'm not afraid of you.

57
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:18,224
I like you, boy.

58
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:21,161
But if you lie to me,

59
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:24,431
I'll pull your guts out
through your throat.

60
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,968
1,000 men.

61
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:36,843
We'll find out soon enough.

62
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:45,418
I don't need you
to protect me.

63
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:46,853
Of course you do.

64
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:49,722
Who stopped Rattleshirt
when he was about to cut your throat?

65
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:52,558
Who vouched for you
with Mance?

66
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,627
It seems
you owe me a debt.

67
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:58,498
- Give it back.
- Well, I stole it.

68
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:02,234
It's mine.
If you want it, come steal it back.

69
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:06,038
<i>Ygritte!</i>

70
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:09,141
<i>Ygritte!</i>

71
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:15,414
Ygritte!
Seven hells.

72
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:17,583
<i>Ygritte!</i>

73
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,490
Is Orell right?

74
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:25,492
Are you still a crow?

75
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:30,263
It's time you
proved yourself.

76
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,032
Ygritte.

77
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,668
You swore some vows.

78
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:36,603
I want you to break 'em.

79
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,874
I want you to see me.

80
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,712
All of me.

81
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,161
We shouldn't.

82
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:06,432
We should.

83
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:28,387
Why are you
still dressed?

84
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:30,923
You know nothing,
Jon Sno--

85
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,973
That thing you did

86
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,975
with your mouth--

87
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:54,347
is that what lords
do to their ladies in the South?

88
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:56,516
I don't know.

89
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,318
I just wanted to kiss
you there is all.

90
00:09:58,386 --> 00:09:59,820
Hmm.

91
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:01,555
You seemed to like it.

92
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,991
Aye, I liked it some.

93
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,593
Who taught you that?

94
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:08,496
There's been no one else.
Only you.

95
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,431
A maid.

96
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,300
You were a maid.

97
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:15,236
I was a man
of the Night's Watch.

98
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:19,173
How about you?
Were you a maid?

99
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:20,608
What do you think?

100
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:23,510
- Who was he?
- Just a boy.

101
00:10:23,545 --> 00:10:26,146
He came trading
with his brothers.

102
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:29,349
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.

103
00:10:29,384 --> 00:10:31,284
But...

104
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,820
he was weak.

105
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,555
Not like you.

106
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,524
That was the first one.

107
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,527
Then there was
this Thenn boy.

108
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:42,997
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.

109
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:46,200
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

110
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,838
We'd best get back.

111
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:53,241
Tormund--

112
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,579
I'm not done
with you yet.

113
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,021
How long's it been
since you had a bath?

114
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:24,672
Let's not go back.

115
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:28,576
Let's stay here
a while longer.

116
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:34,248
I don't ever want
to leave this cave, Jon Snow.

117
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:38,418
Not ever.

118
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:50,465
<i>I want my gold.</i>

119
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:51,933
It says it clearly
right there on that note

120
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,535
you'll be repaid in full
when the war is over.

121
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,904
Piss on that!
You're nothing but thieves.

122
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:58,139
We're outlaws.
Outlaws steal.

123
00:11:58,173 --> 00:11:59,674
You're lucky
we didn't kill you.

124
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,675
Come try it, archer.

125
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,310
I'll shove those arrows
up your ass.

126
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:04,880
You can't let him go.
He's a murderer. He's guilty.

127
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:07,048
- Not in the eyes of god.
- You can't!

128
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,252
Enough! The judgment
isn't ours to make.

129
00:12:12,822 --> 00:12:16,091
Go in peace,
Sandor Clegane.

130
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,859
The Lord of Light
isn't done with you yet.

131
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:25,833
<i>Riders coming through!</i>

132
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,946
The Kingslayer.

133
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,048
Down!

134
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:41,250
On your knees.

135
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:44,387
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

136
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,991
Pick him up, Locke.

137
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,066
You've lost a hand.

138
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,935
No, my lord,
he has it here.

139
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,373
- Take this away.
- Send it to his father?

140
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,509
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

141
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:10,213
Cut her free.
Apologies, my lady.

142
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,281
You're under
my protection now.

143
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:14,951
Thank you, my lord.

144
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:20,256
Find suitable rooms
for our guests.

145
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,026
We'll speak later.

146
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:26,163
Lord Bolton.

147
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,035
Is there word
from the capital?

148
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:34,838
You haven't heard?

149
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:39,009
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

150
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:41,478
<i>Sailed into Blackwater Bay.</i>

151
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:44,749
<i>Stormed the gates</i>
<i>with thousands of men.</i>

152
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:47,785
And your sister...

153
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:55,259
How can I put this?

154
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,196
Your sister...

155
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:02,733
is alive and well.

156
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:05,569
Your father's forces
prevailed.

157
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,172
Ser Jaime isn't well.

158
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:11,641
Take him to Qyburn.

159
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:33,462
- Will I die?
- No.

160
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:34,897
The corruption
has spread.

161
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,932
I fear it must
be cut away.

162
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:40,035
The safest course would be
to take the whole arm off.

163
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,504
Then you'll die.

164
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,509
You're no maester.

165
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:49,278
Where's your chain?

166
00:14:49,313 --> 00:14:51,380
The Citadel
stripped me of it.

167
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:54,650
They found some
of my experiments

168
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,652
too bold.

169
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:00,324
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

170
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,128
I don't need my right hand
to kill you.

171
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,598
I can take away
the rotting flesh

172
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:10,301
and try and burn out
the corruption

173
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,570
- with boiling wine.
- Mmm.

174
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:14,805
With any luck,
that will suffice.

175
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,341
You'll need
milk of the poppy.

176
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:20,644
- No milk of the poppy.
- There will be pain.

177
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,848
- I'll scream.
- Quite a bit of pain.

178
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,984
I'll scream loudly.

179
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,354
Lord Baelish.

180
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:04,022
Your Grace.

181
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:06,024
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

182
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:07,459
Of course, Your Grace.

183
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:08,893
I have reason to believe
that House Tyrell

184
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,962
do not hold the crown's
best interests at heart.

185
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:15,466
I see. And have you shared these
suspicions with Lord Tywin?

186
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,435
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

187
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,138
Myself, I often
find them a hindrance.

188
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:24,275
And he appreciates those
who aid his family, as you well know.

189
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,844
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

190
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:29,080
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

191
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,581
You have a good working
relationship with the Tyrells.

192
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,517
I thought you might look into it
before you leave the capital.

193
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:36,719
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

194
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:40,223
And your best will prove better than
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

195
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:42,025
I assure you
that it will.

196
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,633
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

197
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:53,068
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

198
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,304
Are there any figs?
Fetch some.

199
00:16:55,338 --> 00:16:57,440
I always take figs
midafternoon.

200
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,941
They help move the bowels.

201
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,043
To what do I owe
this summons?

202
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:03,112
Thank you for seeing me,
my lady.

203
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,381
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

204
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:09,185
I climbed all those steps to discuss
financial matters?

205
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:10,486
It's the royal wedding.

206
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,921
I'm told you had a hand
in planning it.

207
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:13,122
Naturally.

208
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:15,624
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

209
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:17,759
The word extravagant
has been used.

210
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:19,461
What good
is the word extravagant

211
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,897
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

212
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:23,999
- I understand that.
- Good.

213
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,501
But, as Master of Coin,
it falls upon me

214
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:28,169
to calculate the cost
for the crown.

215
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:30,706
As of now,
it's a huge expense.

216
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,873
And?

217
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:35,577
And we're at war,
Lady Olenna.

218
00:17:35,611 --> 00:17:37,980
Oh, I'd nearly
forgotten.

219
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,381
Yes, and maintaining
supply lines--

220
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:41,149
<i>I can't think</i>
<i>how it slipped my mind.</i>

221
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,785
What is it,
12,000 infantrymen

222
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,620
<i>the Tyrell family</i>
<i>has supplied?</i>

223
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:47,922
1,800 mounted lances.

224
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,924
<i>2,000 in support.</i>

225
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:53,061
Provisions so this city
might survive the winter.

226
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:54,796
<i>A million bushels</i>
<i>of wheat.</i>

227
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,366
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

228
00:17:58,401 --> 00:18:00,168
<i>20,000 head of cattle.</i>

229
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:01,770
<i>50,000 sheep.</i>

230
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:04,273
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

231
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:06,309
I'm quite familiar
with them.

232
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:08,011
And we are so grateful
for your contributions

233
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,580
which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.

234
00:18:10,648 --> 00:18:12,483
As is a royal wedding.

235
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:15,086
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

236
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,554
They crave distractions.

237
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:19,857
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

238
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,527
And their distractions
are likely to end

239
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,829
with us being torn
to pieces.

240
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:27,198
<i>A royal wedding</i>
<i>is much safer.</i>

241
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,268
- Wouldn't you say?
- I would.

242
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:32,470
<i>And traditionally</i>
<i>paid for</i>

243
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:34,573
by the royal family.

244
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,243
I was told you were
drunk, impertinent,

245
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:40,278
and thoroughly debauched.

246
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:41,880
You can imagine
my disappointment

247
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:44,883
at finding nothing
but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

248
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:49,354
Where did you go
for them, Volantis?

249
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,290
- My lady--
- Oh, very well.

250
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:54,326
I won't have it said
that House Tyrell

251
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,061
refuses to play
its part.

252
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:57,629
We'll pay for half
the expenses

253
00:18:57,664 --> 00:19:00,298
and the celebrations
will go on as planned.

254
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,133
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite sufficient. Thank you.

255
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,503
Very good, then.
That's settled. Good day.

256
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,641
Give me that.

257
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,281
<i>What are you doing?</i>

258
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:19,418
Just mending
Lord Beric's armor.

259
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:21,654
Why?

260
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,089
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

261
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:25,991
Have you lost your mind?

262
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:29,528
When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?

263
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:31,163
They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.

264
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:33,965
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long
before I joined the Brotherhood.

265
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:35,934
You don't have to do this.

266
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,769
I want to.

267
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,237
They need good men.

268
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:42,574
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

269
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,976
- And then you--
- What? Serve him?

270
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:49,047
I've served men
my entire life.

271
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,882
I served Master Mott
at King's Landing

272
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,518
and he sold me
to the Watch.

273
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:55,153
I served Lord Tywin
at Harrenhal,

274
00:19:55,187 --> 00:19:58,122
wondering every day
if I'd get tortured or killed.

275
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,558
I'm done serving.

276
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:02,927
You just said you were
serving Lord Beric.

277
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:07,731
He may be their leader,
but they chose him.

278
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:10,901
These men are brothers.
They're a family.

279
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,505
I've never had a family.

280
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:19,177
I can be your family.

281
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:25,050
You wouldn't be
my family.

282
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,685
You'd be "my lady."

283
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,373
Willem.

284
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,544
Willem!

285
00:20:54,582 --> 00:20:57,918
- Is this a rescue?
- Lannister filth! Take him!

286
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,320
Please, I didn't do anything.
I'm just a squire.

287
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:02,155
Please--

288
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:16,370
Bring them in.

289
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:34,353
Is that all of them?

290
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:39,693
It took five of you to murder
two unarmed squires?

291
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:41,628
Not murder,
Your Grace.

292
00:21:41,662 --> 00:21:43,196
Vengeance.

293
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,732
Vengeance?

294
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:48,134
Those boys didn't
kill your sons.

295
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:51,237
I saw Harrion die
on the battlefield and Torrhen--

296
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:53,272
Was strangled
by the Kingslayer.

297
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:55,574
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

298
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,511
Look at them.

299
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:02,947
Tell your mother
to look at them.

300
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:05,283
<i>She killed them</i>
<i>as much as I.</i>

301
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:07,952
My mother had nothing
to do with this.

302
00:22:07,986 --> 00:22:09,820
This was your treason.

303
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:12,289
It's treason
to free your enemies.

304
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:14,424
In war, you kill
your enemies.

305
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,560
Did your father
not teach you that, boy?

306
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:18,628
Leave him.

307
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,401
Aye.

308
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,769
Leave me to the king.

309
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:30,440
He wants to give me
a scolding before he sets me free.

310
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:34,944
That's how he deals
with treason.

311
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,280
Our King in the North.

312
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,682
Or should I call him

313
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:42,752
the King Who Lost
the North?

314
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:48,090
Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon.

315
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,825
Hang the rest.

316
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,327
Mercy, sire!
I didn't kill anyone.

317
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:52,829
I only watched
for the guards.

318
00:22:52,863 --> 00:22:54,998
This one was only
the watcher.

319
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:57,100
Hang him last so he can watch
the others die.

320
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,236
<i>Please! Please, no.</i>
<i>They made me do it!</i>

321
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,206
They made me!
They made me!

322
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:13,717
Word of this
can't leave Riverrun.

323
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,619
They were Tywin
Lannister's nephews.

324
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,354
The Lannisters
pay their debts.

325
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:18,789
<i>They never stop</i>
<i>talking about it.</i>

326
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,758
Would you make me a liar
as well as a murderer?

327
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:22,526
It wouldn't be lying.

328
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,761
We will bury them
and remain silent

329
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:26,196
<i>until the war is done.</i>

330
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,631
I'm not fighting
for justice

331
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:30,534
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

332
00:23:30,568 --> 00:23:33,504
<i>no matter how highborn.</i>

333
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,107
He has to die.

334
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,843
The Karstarks
are Northmen.

335
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:41,212
They won't forgive
the killing of their lord.

336
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:43,214
Your mother's right.

337
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:46,017
If you do this, the Karstarks will
abandon you.

338
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,119
You tended to their wounds.

339
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:50,856
You brought them supper.
Now they're dead.

340
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,727
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

341
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:56,896
<i>You need Karstark men</i>
<i>to end it.</i>

342
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,365
Spare his life.
Keep him as a hostage.

343
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:01,467
A hostage.

344
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:04,805
<i>Tell the Karstarks</i>
<i>that as long as they remain loyal,</i>

345
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,907
he will not be harmed.

346
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:35,202
The blood of the First Men
flows through my veins

347
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:38,238
as much as yours, boy.

348
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:40,974
I fought the Mad King
for your father.

349
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:44,612
I fought Joffrey
for you.

350
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,114
We are kin--

351
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:48,449
Stark and Karstark.

352
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:50,884
That didn't stop you
from betraying me.

353
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:52,486
And it won't save you now.

354
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,388
I don't want it
to save me.

355
00:24:55,423 --> 00:24:59,059
I want it to haunt you
to the end of your days.

356
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:01,728
Kneel, my lord.

357
00:25:10,705 --> 00:25:13,206
Rickard Karstark,

358
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:14,808
<i>Lord of Karhold,</i>

359
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:18,346
here in sight of gods and men,
I sentence you to die.

360
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,282
Would you speak
a final word?

361
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:24,953
Kill me
and be cursed.

362
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:28,090
You are no king of mine.

363
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:44,706
<i>Joffrey.</i>

364
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,741
Cersei.

365
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,412
Ilyn Payne.

366
00:25:51,982 --> 00:25:53,983
Ser Meryn.

367
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,189
The Hound.

368
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,628
What are you
going to do with me?

369
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,298
At first light
we'll ride for Riverrun.

370
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,166
Your brother's there now.

371
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,669
He'll make a contribution
to our cause

372
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,371
and you can go home.

373
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,140
I'm a hostage
and you're selling me.

374
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,609
Don't think of it
that way.

375
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:20,311
- But it is that way.
- <i>It is.</i>

376
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:23,180
- And it isn't.
- More is than isn't.

377
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,319
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

378
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,488
He wanted to refuse
your ransom altogether.

379
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:34,024
- So why don't you?
- We need the gold.

380
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,805
Do I frighten you, child?

381
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,674
No.

382
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,245
You're angry with me.

383
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,913
And I don't blame you.

384
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,467
But letting him go
was the right thing.

385
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:00,051
I have more reason than most
to want him hanged.

386
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,586
- I thought he killed you.
- He did.

387
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,455
But how...?

388
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,657
Thoros...

389
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,559
how many times
have you brought me back?

390
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,062
It's the Lord of Light
brings you back.

391
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,330
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

392
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:16,999
- How many times?
- <i>Five, I think.</i>

393
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:19,168
<i>No, this makes six.</i>

394
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:20,536
Six.

395
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:23,539
There was the first time--
the Mountain.

396
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:25,107
<i>Show her.</i>

397
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:28,910
Lance right through
the chest.

398
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:31,380
Then I was stabbed
in the belly.

399
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,781
Then it was an arrow
in the back.

400
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:35,550
<i>And that axe in the side.</i>

401
00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:38,920
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

402
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,791
Was it a hanging
or a dagger in the eye?

403
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,994
Both.
Fuckers couldn't decide.

404
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:48,563
<i>And the Hound makes six.</i>

405
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:50,733
Second time I've been
killed by a Clegane.

406
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:52,768
<i>You'd think you'd learn.</i>

407
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:57,006
It's not getting
any easier, you know.

408
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,041
<i>I know.</i>

409
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:01,176
<i>Every time I come back,</i>

410
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:03,245
I'm a bit less.

411
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:07,249
Pieces of you
get chipped away.

412
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:11,053
Could you bring back
a man without a head?

413
00:28:13,055 --> 00:28:16,691
Not six times.
Just once.

414
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:19,628
I don't think it works
that way, child.

415
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:28,204
He was a good man,
Ned Stark.

416
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:32,141
<i>He's at rest now,</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>

417
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:34,576
I would never wish
my life upon him.

418
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,745
I would.

419
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:41,150
You're alive.

420
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:49,157
Lord, cast your light
upon me.

421
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:53,562
Protect me
in the darkness.

422
00:28:53,596 --> 00:28:57,099
Burn away my sins.

423
00:28:57,133 --> 00:29:00,369
Help me serve you.

424
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:02,572
Use me as you will.

425
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,644
For the night is dark

426
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,180
and full of terrors.

427
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,161
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

428
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,865
My lady.

429
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,734
I meant to come sooner.

430
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,004
- The battle--
- I know of your troubles, my king.

431
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,774
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

432
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,310
Yes, of course.

433
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:51,824
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true.

434
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,626
- You will be victorious.
- I believed that once.

435
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:58,097
You are
the one god's champion

436
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,366
and the finest man
I've ever known.

437
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,868
Selyse.

438
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,705
I've broken a sacred vow.

439
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,544
I've sinned.

440
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:14,714
- No.
- I've wronged you.

441
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:18,351
- I have shamed you.
- You're doing god's work.

442
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:20,454
You don't understand.

443
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:28,162
The Red Woman--

444
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:31,632
the Lady Melisandre--

445
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,634
I know, Stannis.

446
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:37,705
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

447
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:40,975
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light

448
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,778
can ever be a sin.

449
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:47,082
When she told me,

450
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:51,319
I wept with joy.

451
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,467
Oh, my sweet boys.

452
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:10,639
<i>Petyr, Tommard,</i>

453
00:31:10,673 --> 00:31:12,675
<i>Edric.</i>

454
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:17,513
I thank god
every day

455
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:20,584
<i>for bringing</i>
<i>Melisandre to us.</i>

456
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:22,953
She gave you a son.

457
00:31:24,256 --> 00:31:26,924
I gave you...

458
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:30,527
- <i>nothing.</i>
- That's not true.

459
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,967
So you've come
to see her as well?

460
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:42,337
There is no need.

461
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,307
You must keep away
from such distractions.

462
00:31:46,342 --> 00:31:48,042
She's my daughter.

463
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:51,679
I want to see her.

464
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:57,019
You are a king.

465
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:59,855

my permission.

Father!

475
00:32:35,527 --> 00:32:37,627
You've grown
since I last saw you.

476
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:41,165
Mother said you fought
in a battle.

477
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:42,767
Did you win?

478
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:46,070
No.

479
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:48,539
Did the Onion Knight
come back with you?

480
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,009
He did.

481
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:53,778
He fought bravely.

482
00:32:53,812 --> 00:32:55,479
He hasn't come
to visit me.

483
00:32:55,513 --> 00:32:58,515
He said he'd bring me back a
present from the capital.

484
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,217
He won't be visiting, child.

485
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,785
Why not?
He's my friend.

486
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,387
Look.

487
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:13,595
He made this for me.

488
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,998
But don't tell Mother
I have it.

489
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,933
It's a secret.

490
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:20,636
Mother doesn't like
the Onion Knight.

491
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:25,108
Ser Davos
is a traitor.

492
00:33:27,077 --> 00:33:30,380
He's rotting in a dungeon
cell for his crime.

493
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:41,591
Best forget him.

494
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:56,273
Not so hard.
You'll scrub the skin off.

495
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:57,741
What are you
doing here?

496
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:59,109
I need a bath.

497
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:01,779
Help me out
of these rags.

498
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:11,255
Now get out.

499
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:25,303
There's another tub.

500
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:28,272
This one suits me fine.

501
00:34:40,985 --> 00:34:43,786
Don't worry.
I'm not interested.

502
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:49,191
<i>If I faint, pull me out.</i>

503
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:52,260
I don't intend to be the first Lannister
to die in a bathtub.

504
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:54,062
Why should I care
how you die?

505
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:57,065
You swore a solemn vow,
remember?

506
00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:00,768
You're supposed to get me to
King's Landing in one piece.

507
00:35:01,737 --> 00:35:04,238
Not going so well, is it?

508
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:06,907
No wonder Renly died
with you guarding him.

509
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:19,053
That was unworthy.
Forgive me.

510
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:21,055
You protected me
better than most--

511
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,825
- Don't you mock me.
- I'm apologizing.

512
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,696
I'm sick of fighting.

513
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,198
<i>Let's call a truce.</i>

514
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:31,033
You need trust
to have a truce.

515
00:35:32,435 --> 00:35:34,704
I trust you.

516
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:44,582
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>There's the look.</i>

517
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:47,085
I've seen it for 17 years

518
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,753
on face after face.

519
00:35:48,787 --> 00:35:52,023
<i>You all despise me.</i>

520
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:53,791
Kingslayer.

521
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:55,994
Oathbreaker.

522
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,930
A man without honor.

523
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:06,103
You've heard of wildfire?

524
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:07,638
Of course.

525
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:10,441
<i>The Mad King</i>
<i>was obsessed with it.</i>

526
00:36:10,475 --> 00:36:13,010
He loved to watch
people burn,

527
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:15,579
the way their skin
blackened and blistered

528
00:36:15,613 --> 00:36:18,215
<i>and melted</i>
<i>off their bones.</i>

529
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,418
<i>He burned lords</i>
<i>he didn't like.</i>

530
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:22,520
<i>He burned Hands</i>
<i>who disobeyed him.</i>

531
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:25,989
He burned anyone
who was against him.

532
00:36:27,392 --> 00:36:30,693
Before long, half the country
was against him.

533
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:36,098
Aerys saw traitors
everywhere.

534
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:41,637
So he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire

535
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,106
<i>all over the city--</i>

536
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,408
beneath the Sept
of Baelor

537
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,210
and the slums
of Flea Bottom.

538
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,548
Under houses,
stables, taverns.

539
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:54,918
Even beneath
the Red Keep itself.

540
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:59,056
Finally,

541
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,326
the day
of reckoning came.

542
00:37:02,361 --> 00:37:04,729
Robert Baratheon
marched on the capital

543
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:06,831
after his victory
at the Trident.

544
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,267
But my father
arrived first

545
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:12,036
with the whole Lannister
army at his back,

546
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:16,474
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

547
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:20,377
I knew my father
better than that.

548
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:23,747
<i>He's never been one</i>
<i>to pick the losing side.</i>

549
00:37:23,781 --> 00:37:26,350
<i>I told the Mad King</i>
<i>as much.</i>

550
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:30,120
I urged him
to surrender peacefully.

551
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:33,356
<i>But the king didn't</i>
<i>listen to me.</i>

552
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:36,093
He didn't listen to Varys
who tried to warn him.

553
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:40,497
But he did listen
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

554
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:43,200
that grey, sunken cunt.

555
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:47,505
"You can trust
the Lannisters," he said.

556
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,409
"The Lannisters
have always been

557
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:53,678
true friends
of the crown."

558
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:58,549
So we opened the gates

559
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:00,818
and my father
sacked the city.

560
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:04,255
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>I came to the king,</i>

561
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,458
begging him to surrender.

562
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:13,564
He told me to...

563
00:38:13,598 --> 00:38:16,133
bring him
my father's head.

564
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,536
Then he...

565
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,539
turned to his pyromancer.

566
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:25,341
"Burn them all,"
he said.

567
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,446
"Burn them
in their homes.

568
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,615
Burn them
in their beds."

569
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:37,756
Tell me,
if your precious Renly

570
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,659
commanded you to kill
your own father

571
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:43,729
and stand by while
thousands of men,

572
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:45,998
women, and children
burned alive,

573
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,734
would you have done it?

574
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:50,569
Would you have
kept your oath then?

575
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,143
First, I killed
the pyromancer.

576
00:38:58,177 --> 00:39:01,780
<i>And then when the king</i>
<i>turned to flee,</i>

577
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:05,317
I drove my sword
into his back.

578
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,054
<i>"Burn them all,"</i>
<i>he kept saying.</i>

579
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:11,056
"Burn them all."

580
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:13,325
I don't think
he expected to die.

581
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,295
He-- he meant to...

582
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,332
burn with the rest of us

583
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:23,168
and rise again,

584
00:39:23,203 --> 00:39:25,070
reborn as a dragon

585
00:39:25,105 --> 00:39:27,005
to turn his enemies
to ash.

586
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:34,346
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

587
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:42,220
That's where Ned Stark
found me.

588
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,455
If this is true...

589
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:47,959
why didn't you tell anyone?

590
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:51,829
Why didn't you tell
Lord Stark?

591
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:53,364
Stark?

592
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:55,867
You think

593
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:59,838
the honorable Ned Stark

594
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:03,142
wanted to hear my side?

595
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:05,877
He judged me guilty

596
00:40:05,912 --> 00:40:08,313
the moment
he set eyes on me.

597
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:15,254
By what right
does the wolf

598
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,289
judge the lion?

599
00:40:18,592 --> 00:40:20,159
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

600
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:21,827
The Kingslayer!

601
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:25,164
Jaime.

602
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:27,200
My name is Jaime.

603
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:32,773
<i>Onion Knight.</i>

604
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,742
<i>Ser Onion Knight.</i>

605
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:38,412
Princess?
Gods, what are you doing here?

606
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:40,914
- Shh, you'll wake Bert.
- Bert?

607
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:44,018
He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.

608
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:45,953
He likes to drink wine
and sleep a lot.

609
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:48,555
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

610
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:50,724
- If your father knew--
- He said you were a traitor.

611
00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:52,993
Are you?

612
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:55,595
I am, child.

613
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:57,564
I disobeyed my king,
your father,

614
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:59,432
and now I'm paying
the price.

615
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,968
I don't care.
You're my friend.

616
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:03,937
You must get bored
down here.

617
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:05,906
I brought you
something to read.

618
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,775
It's about Aegon
and his dragons.

619
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:11,244
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?

620
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,080
- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

621
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:15,382
- So they did.
- You can hide the book under your cloak.

622
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,785
It's a good one.
I'll bring you more.

623
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:20,688
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

624
00:41:20,722 --> 00:41:22,123
but it's wasted on me.

625
00:41:22,157 --> 00:41:24,625
Take it.
I have more.

626
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:28,362
My lady, I can't read
the words.

627
00:41:28,397 --> 00:41:30,465
You can't?

628
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:33,201
I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.

629
00:41:33,235 --> 00:41:35,069
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

630
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:37,238
- Go. We can't.
- Why not?

631
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:40,041
What will they do,
lock us in cells?

632
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:48,016
I wouldn't know
where to start.

633
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,784
At the beginning.

634
00:41:49,818 --> 00:41:51,719
This word is Aegon.

635
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:55,857
When you see A, E, and G
together like that,

636
00:41:55,891 --> 00:41:57,792
it sounds like egg.

637
00:41:57,826 --> 00:41:59,728
And the title
of the whole book

638
00:41:59,762 --> 00:42:01,930
is "An History
of Aegon the Conqueror

639
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:04,132
<i>and His Conquest</i>
<i>of Westeros."</i>

640
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:17,979
It was a bitch
of a siege.

641
00:42:18,014 --> 00:42:20,182
Mm, you were first
through the breach at Pyke?

642
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:23,685
The second.
Thoros of Myr went in alone,

643
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:25,887
waving that
flaming sword of his.

644
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:28,623
Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.

645
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:31,593
Robert knighted you
after the battle?

646
00:42:31,627 --> 00:42:33,495
Proudest moment
of my life.

647
00:42:33,529 --> 00:42:36,731
One knee in the dust,
the king's sword on my shoulder,

648
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:38,066
listening to the words.

649
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,803
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

650
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,774
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

651
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:48,711
In full plate metal
for 16 hours.

652
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:50,714
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

653
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:53,951
I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss on the king's boots.

654
00:42:55,787 --> 00:42:58,022
Robert would have
laughed.

655
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:00,658
He was a good man,
a great warrior.

656
00:43:02,494 --> 00:43:04,428
And a terrible king.

657
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:07,831
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

658
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:09,400
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

659
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:11,302
And a man of honor
keeps his vows,

660
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:14,738
even if he's serving
a drunk or a lunatic.

661
00:43:14,773 --> 00:43:17,341
Just once in my life
before it's over,

662
00:43:17,376 --> 00:43:20,411
I want to know what it's like
to serve with pride,

663
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:23,581
to fight for someone
I believe in.

664
00:43:23,615 --> 00:43:25,382
Do you believe in her?

665
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:30,054
With all my heart.

666
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:36,660
These are the ones?

667
00:43:36,695 --> 00:43:38,829
Yes, khaleesi.
The officers.

668
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:16,901
All Unsullied boys
are given new names

669
00:44:16,935 --> 00:44:18,535
when they are cut--

670
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:21,438
Grey Worm, Red Flea,
Black Rat.

671
00:44:21,473 --> 00:44:24,241
<i>Names that remind them</i>
<i>what they are--</i>

672
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:26,777
vermin.

673
00:45:13,693 --> 00:45:16,061
<i>King Robert</i>
<i>wanted her dead.</i>

674
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:17,329
Of course
he wanted her dead.

675
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:20,466
She's a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.

676
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:23,603
I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

677
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,172
- I didn't sit on the small council.
- No?

678
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:28,808
Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard traditionally--

679
00:45:28,843 --> 00:45:30,710
Traditionally, yes,
but I killed a dozen

680
00:45:30,744 --> 00:45:32,879
of Robert's friends
during his rebellion.

681
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:36,715
He didn't want advice
on how to govern

682
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,684
from a man who had fought
for the Mad King.

683
00:45:38,718 --> 00:45:41,620
Can't say
I minded much.

684
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,822
I always hated
the politics.

685
00:45:43,857 --> 00:45:45,791
Yeah, I imagine
I would, too.

686
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:48,260
Hours spent jabbering
about backstabbings

687
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:51,463
- and betrayals the world over.
- Mm-hmm.

688
00:45:54,634 --> 00:45:56,535
Still, she'll have
to wade through that muck

689
00:45:56,569 --> 00:45:58,771
if she wants to rule
the Seven Kingdoms.

690
00:45:58,805 --> 00:46:00,873
She'll have good men
around her to advise her,

691
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:02,374
men with experience.

692
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:03,909
Which men do you
have in mind?

693
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:05,945
Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
for what I'm about to say,

694
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:09,549
but your reputation in Westeros
has suffered over the years.

695
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,985
It suffered for a reason.

696
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,786
I sold men into slavery.

697
00:46:13,821 --> 00:46:15,655
I don't know
if your presence by her side

698
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,957
will help our cause
when we go home.

699
00:46:17,991 --> 00:46:19,792
Our cause?

700
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:21,861
Forgive me, Ser Barristan,
but I was busy

701
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:24,097
defending the khaleesi against
King Robert's assassins

702
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:25,932
while you were still
bowing to the man.

703
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:28,968
We both want her to rule.
Am I wrong?

704
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:31,604
You only joined us
a few days ago.

705
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:33,772
I can't speak
to your intentions.

706
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:35,941
If we're truly
her loyal servants,

707
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:38,777
we will do whatever
needs to be done,

708
00:46:38,811 --> 00:46:41,413
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

709
00:46:41,447 --> 00:46:44,015
You're not
Lord Commander here.

710
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,618
You're just another exile.

711
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:48,720
And I take my orders
from the queen.

712
00:46:56,895 --> 00:46:59,730
<i>- Come to bed.</i>
- You were right.

713
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:02,700
The Karstarks are gone.

714
00:47:03,668 --> 00:47:05,903
Almost half our forces.

715
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:09,440
Tywin Lannister knows what he
needs to do to make us unravel.

716
00:47:09,474 --> 00:47:12,343
Nothing.

717
00:47:12,378 --> 00:47:14,512
Only wait.

718
00:47:14,546 --> 00:47:17,048
Don't let him.

719
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:19,183
What can I do?

720
00:47:19,218 --> 00:47:20,651
Attack King's Landing?

721
00:47:20,686 --> 00:47:22,820
There's nothing
he'd like better.

722
00:47:22,854 --> 00:47:24,855
He'd crush us
in a day.

723
00:47:25,891 --> 00:47:27,024
We could ride north.

724
00:47:27,058 --> 00:47:29,727
<i>Take your land back</i>
<i>from the Greyjoys.</i>

725
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:33,030
- Wait out the winter.
- Winter could last five years.

726
00:47:33,065 --> 00:47:34,431
Once my bannermen
are home again,

727
00:47:34,466 --> 00:47:37,235
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

728
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:40,338
warm and safe,
they'll never ride south again.

729
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:42,507
When I gathered
my lords together,

730
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:44,443
we had a purpose,
a mission.

731
00:47:44,477 --> 00:47:47,245
Now we're like a band
of bickering children.

732
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:51,517
Give them a new purpose.

733
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,252
What?

734
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:56,955
Oh, I don't know.

735
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,491
I don't even know
where Winterfell is.

736
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:04,096
Here.

737
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:10,903
And we're here.
King's Landing--

738
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:19,312
What is it?

739
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:25,718
I can't force them
to meet us in the field

740
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:28,153
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

741
00:48:28,187 --> 00:48:31,090
but I can attack them
where they're not.

742
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:35,127
And Casterly Rock
can't run away.

743
00:48:36,396 --> 00:48:39,432
I'm going to take
their home away from them.

744
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,869
Can you do it?

745
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:45,906
I need men to replace the Karstarks
who marched home.

746
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,542
There is only one person
in this kingdom

747
00:48:48,576 --> 00:48:51,778
with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.

748
00:48:53,214 --> 00:48:55,915
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

749
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:58,851
Walder Frey.

750
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:09,995
He's such
a splendid fighter.

751
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:13,365
Do you have any idea
when we might...

752
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,036
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

753
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:18,537
It should grow quickly.

754
00:49:18,571 --> 00:49:20,205
Joffrey won't let me leave.

755
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,975
He's got too many reasons
to keep me here.

756
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:26,345
And only one
to let you go.

757
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:28,580
Because it will
please me.

758
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:30,649
<i>Squire!</i>

759
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,888
Well fought, ser.

760
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:38,690
That was no fight.
I don't know you.

761
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,059
Olyver,
if it please you.

762
00:49:43,229 --> 00:49:46,097
I should like to see you spar with
a proper partner, ser.

763
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,673
How did you know?

764
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:57,609
Know what?

765
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:00,779
That I wanted to.

766
00:50:00,813 --> 00:50:02,680
My lord...

767
00:50:06,718 --> 00:50:08,386
I'll have you know
I'm to be married soon

768
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,489
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

769
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:14,626
They rarely do,
in my experience.

770
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:17,028
You have a good deal
of experience, do you?

771
00:50:17,963 --> 00:50:20,131
With the husbands.

772
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:31,310
That didn't take long.

773
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:33,547
Well, it took long enough.

774
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,085
It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

775
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,920
Is he?

776
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,255
And...

777
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,091
who's the lucky girl?

778
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:47,628
<i>She may not be the grandest</i>
<i>ship in the world</i>

779
00:50:47,662 --> 00:50:50,130
or the fastest,

780
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:52,333
but she's mine.

781
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,805
I've always wanted a ship.

782
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,974
Now I want a dozen.

783
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:02,644
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

784
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:04,847
It doesn't matter
what we want,

785
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:06,682
once we get it,

786
00:51:06,716 --> 00:51:08,451
then we want
something else.

787
00:51:11,221 --> 00:51:13,923
Your hair is different.

788
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:15,591
Is it?

789
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,226
Lady Margaery
wears it that way.

790
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,662
Many ladies
wear it this way.

791
00:51:19,696 --> 00:51:21,431
I have good news.

792
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:23,566
I'll be leaving
the city soon.

793
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,067
You still want me
to come with you?

794
00:51:25,102 --> 00:51:27,303
It's not a question
of what I want.

795
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,539
It's what you want.

796
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:30,773
You want to go home,
don't you?

797
00:51:30,807 --> 00:51:33,242
Of course.
More than anything.

798
00:51:35,412 --> 00:51:38,814
But maybe it would
be better to wait.

799
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:41,651
I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.

800
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:44,553
Not just for me,
but for you.

801
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:45,854
You've been so kind.

802
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:49,057
I'd feel terrible if anything
happened to you.

803
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:52,427
I can't tell you
how touched I am

804
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:55,697
by your concern
for my welfare.

805
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:58,534
I hope you know that
I'm your friend, Sansa.

806
00:51:58,601 --> 00:52:00,602
Your true friend.

807
00:52:00,637 --> 00:52:02,337
I do, Lord Baelish.

808
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,041
- Petyr.
- Petyr.

809
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:07,176
If you wish to stay,

810
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:10,212
then of course
you will stay.

811
00:52:15,118 --> 00:52:17,486
We'll speak again
when I return.

812
00:52:30,499 --> 00:52:32,633
<i>You're late.</i>

813
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:35,469
What's she doing here?

814
00:52:35,504 --> 00:52:37,538
Our business
concerns her, too.

815
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,406
<i>Sit.</i>

816
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:43,010
You'll be pleased to learn

817
00:52:43,045 --> 00:52:46,113
that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

818
00:52:46,147 --> 00:52:48,181
I've saved the crown

819
00:52:48,216 --> 00:52:51,018
hundreds of thousands
on this wedding.

820
00:52:51,052 --> 00:52:52,086
Never mind that now.

821
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,640
We have something
important to discuss.

822
00:52:53,655 --> 00:52:56,090
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

823
00:52:56,992 --> 00:52:58,426
Stop that.

824
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,394
You're making me
uncomfortable.

825
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:03,398
Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

826
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:06,436
are plotting to marry
Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

827
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:08,238
Very well.

828
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,306
She's a lovely girl.

829
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,341
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits,

830
00:53:12,376 --> 00:53:14,177
but I'm sure
they'll make do.

831
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:16,746
- Your jokes are not appreciated.
- It wasn't my best, but--

832
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,882
I bring them into the royal fold
and this is how they repay me,

833
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:23,386
by trying to steal the key to
the North out from under me.

834
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,088
Sansa is the key
to the North?

835
00:53:25,122 --> 00:53:27,490
I seem to remember
she has an older brother.

836
00:53:27,524 --> 00:53:29,525
The Karstarks
have marched home.

837
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,495
The young wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

838
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:35,632
<i>Theon Greyjoy murdered</i>
<i>both his brothers.</i>

839
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:39,002
That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell.

840
00:53:39,037 --> 00:53:42,873
And I am not about
to hand her over to the Tyrells.

841
00:53:42,908 --> 00:53:45,209
<i>The Tyrell army is helping</i>
<i>us to win this war.</i>

842
00:53:45,244 --> 00:53:48,012
Do you really think
it's wise to refuse them?

843
00:53:48,047 --> 00:53:49,847
There's nothing to refuse.
This is a plot.

844
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:52,684
<i>Plots are not</i>
<i>public knowledge.</i>

845
00:53:52,718 --> 00:53:54,452
And the Tyrells
won't carry this one out

846
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:56,654
until after
Joffrey's wedding.

847
00:53:56,689 --> 00:54:00,458
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

848
00:54:00,492 --> 00:54:01,893
And how do we do that?

849
00:54:01,927 --> 00:54:04,194
We find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

850
00:54:04,229 --> 00:54:06,830
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

851
00:54:14,406 --> 00:54:15,973
You can't mean it.

852
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:17,474
I can and I do.

853
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:20,611
Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable

854
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:22,680
since the day he took
her father's head.

855
00:54:22,714 --> 00:54:25,749
Now she's finally free of
him and you give her to me?

856
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:27,484
That's cruel even for you.

857
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:29,386
Do you intend
on mistreating her?

858
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:31,355
The girl's happiness
is not my concern,

859
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,624
- nor should it be yours.
- She's a child!

860
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:36,528
She's flowered, I assure you.
She and I have discussed it at length.

861
00:54:36,562 --> 00:54:40,065
There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.

862
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:43,135
- <i>Surely you're capable of that.</i>
- And if I refuse?

863
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,839
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

864
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:49,876
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
you could ever dare hope for.

865
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:52,412
And it is past time
you were wed.

866
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:55,281
I was wed.

867
00:54:55,316 --> 00:54:57,884
Or don't you remember?

868
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,454
Only too well.

869
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:04,858
<i>You should be thanking</i>
<i>the gods for this.</i>

870
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:06,526
This is more
than you deserve.

871
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:09,029
<i>Tyrion will do as he's bid.</i>

872
00:55:09,063 --> 00:55:11,131
As will you.

873
00:55:12,533 --> 00:55:14,634
What do you mean?

874
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:16,536
You'll marry Ser Loras.

875
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:21,141
- I will not.
- The boy is heir to Highgarden.

876
00:55:21,175 --> 00:55:23,644
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

877
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:26,414
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

878
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,150
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

879
00:55:29,184 --> 00:55:31,352
I am Queen Regent,
not some broodmare.

880
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:34,055
You're my daughter!

881
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:35,724
You will do as I command

882
00:55:35,758 --> 00:55:37,993
and you will marry
Loras Tyrell

883
00:55:38,027 --> 00:55:40,362
and put an end
to the disgusting rumors

884
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:43,198
about you
once and for all.

885
00:55:43,233 --> 00:55:45,334
Father, don't make me
do it again, please.

886
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:47,904
Not another word.

887
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:51,006
My children.

888
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:54,944
You've disgraced the Lannister
name for far too long.
