1
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,743
You've got too much
wood in there.

2
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:11,413
But the more wood,
the bigger the fire.

3
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,549
It needs to breathe.

4
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,518
<i>Take off that big log.</i>

5
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,399
Huh.
You know your fires.

6
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:39,911
Someone built your fires
for you growing up?

7
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:42,814
It doesn't get so cold
down in the Reach.

8
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,684
And there were
servants, of course.

9
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,987
I knew you were highborn.

10
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:56,394
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

11
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,931
Buried treasure.

12
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:03,468
Thousands of years old.

13
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,102
I think.

14
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,206
What does it do?

15
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:11,942
I'm not sure
that it does anything.

16
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:14,178
It's beautiful, though,
isn't it?

17
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:25,456
- How much longer?
- Not so far.

18
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,658
A few more days.

19
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:31,029
Is the Wall
as big as they say?

20
00:03:31,063 --> 00:03:32,931
Bigger.

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,169
So big you can't even see
the top sometimes.

22
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:39,205
It's hidden in clouds.

23
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:42,575
You're playing with me.

24
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:46,780
I'm not.
It's 700 feet high,

25
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:49,116
all made of ice.

26
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:51,819
On a warm day
you can see it weeping.

27
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:59,727
Castle Black
is nice enough.

28
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:03,097
They keep a fire burning
in the long hall

29
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,866
day and night.

30
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,037
And Hobb makes
venison stew

31
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,838
with onions.

32
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:12,273
Very tasty.

33
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:16,611
Sometimes, one of
the brothers will sing.

34
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:19,180
Dareon sings best.

35
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:21,315
- Do you sing?
- No.

36
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,151
No, no, no.
Not very well.

37
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:28,723
Sing me a song.

38
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:32,360
Oh, all right.

39
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,296
Let's see.

40
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:39,066
Oh... ahem.

49

That's not how
you skin a rabbit.

50
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,508
I know how
to skin a rabbit.

51
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,877
Not by the looks of it.

52
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:40,994
You grow up
north of the Wall,

53
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,863
you learn the proper
way to handle game.

54
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:45,332
I didn't see any game
before I got here.

55
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,936
If I had a bow, I could have shot
a dozen rabbits.

56
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,504
Well, I made
this bow myself.

57
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,639
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.

58
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:54,807
You learn how to use
your fists, though.

59
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,876
Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?

60
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,378
I had someone else in mind.

61
00:05:58,412 --> 00:05:59,879
Well, someone else
is sitting right here.

62
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:02,382
You're both very good
at skinning rabbits.

63
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,251
Some of us are just
a little better.

64
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:07,253
Well, some of us would say
thank you when someone else

65
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:09,355
hunts down their
breakfast for them.

66
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,324
Or don't they teach you to say
thank you north of the Wall?

67
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,994
You've got a big mouth, girl,
and too many teeth.

68
00:06:15,028 --> 00:06:17,196
- Stop it!
- Hodor.

69
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,732
You've been fighting since you met.
Just stop it.

70
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,568
Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

71
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:24,069
it's a wonder her feet
touch the ground.

72
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:26,439
You've been nasty
to her every day.

73
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:27,873
Of course she's nasty back.

74
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:29,508
Me? It's my fault?

75
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,710
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

76
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:34,079
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

77
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,950
We can't fight each other.

78
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:40,253
We'll never make it
to the Wall.

79
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:43,022
I want you both
to make peace.

80
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,201
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

81
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:56,837
- I said so, didn't I?
- Osha!

82
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:02,008
You're a good
little hunter.

83
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,476
Thank you.

84
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:04,944
See?

85
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,712
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.

86
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:08,147
Don't push me.

87
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,559
Shh.

88
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,628
I'm right here with you.

89
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:24,596
What's happening?

90
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:26,799
I'm right here with you.

91
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:29,701
What's wrong with him?

92
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,907
The visions
take their toll.

93
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,244
He's having one now?

94
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:01,432
I saw Jon Snow.

95
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,435
You saw him?

96
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,036
At Castle Black?

97
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,739
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall...

98
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,375
surrounded by enemies.

99
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,555
Used to be you couldn't
find a tree within a mile of the Wall.

100
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,725
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

101
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:35,464
Your flock gets smaller
every year.

102
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:43,573
You ever climbed it before?

103
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,676
No.

104
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,646
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

105
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:56,455
You're afraid.

106
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:00,692
- Aren't you?
- <i>Aye.</i>

107
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:03,462
It's a long way up
and a long way down.

108
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,865
But I've waited
my whole life

109
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,900
to see the world
from up there.

110
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,408
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.

111
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:19,712
They're too big for you,
but they're good.

112
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:21,581
You kill someone
for them?

113
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:23,783
Nah.

114
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,585
<i>I didn't kill him,</i>

115
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:27,987
but I bet his balls
are still bruised.

116
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:37,631
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,269
He didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

118
00:09:43,404 --> 00:09:45,072
Can we not talk
about that here?

119
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:47,575
"Can we not talk
about that here?

120
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,410
I'm Jon Snow.

121
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,446
I've killed dead men
and Qhorin Halfhand,

122
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,582
but I'm scared
of naked girls."

123
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,117
Did I seem scared
the other day?

124
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:56,785
You were trembling
like a leaf.

125
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:58,353
Only in the beginning.

126
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:01,757
Only in the beginning.

127
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:06,896
You're a proper lover,
Jon Snow.

128
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,799
And don't worry.

129
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,901
Your secret's safe
with me.

130
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:14,370
What secret?

131
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:17,873
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls

132
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,843
in silk dresses
you knew growing up?

133
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:24,813
You're loyal
and you're brave.

134
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:30,685
You didn't stop
being a crow

135
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,421
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

136
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,464
But I'm your woman now,
Jon Snow.

137
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:47,970
You're going to be loyal
to your woman.

138
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,645
The Night's Watch
don't care if you live or die.

139
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,048
Mance Rayder don't care
if I live or die.

140
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:00,650
We're just soldiers
in their armies

141
00:11:00,684 --> 00:11:02,986
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

142
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,197
It's you and me

143
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:16,300
that matters
to me and you.

144
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,272
Don't ever betray me.

145
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,081
I won't.

146
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:34,184
'Cause I'll cut
your pretty cock right off

147
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:36,520
and wear it
'round my neck.

148
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,098
Sink your metal deep

149
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:53,668
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

150
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,204
And if you fall,

151
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,973
don't scream.

152
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:01,644
You don't want that to be the
last thing she remembers.

153
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,926
<i>Joffrey.</i>

154
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,932
Cersei.

155
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:23,834
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

156
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:26,970
You're good.

157
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:34,311
You're not as good
as you think you are.

158
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:38,648
Face, tits, balls--

159
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,250
I hit 'em right
where I wanted to.

160
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:44,020
Aye, but you took
your sweet time of it.

161
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:47,557
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

162
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,827
Show me your position.

163
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,398
Keep your elbow high.

164
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:59,401
You want your back
doing the hard labor.

165
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,337
You're holding.

166
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,106
Never hold.

167
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,075
- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.

168
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,377
Pull the string back
to the center of your chin

169
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:11,878
and release.

170
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:13,813
Never hold.

171
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,882
But I have to aim.

172
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,584
Never aim.

173
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:19,185
Never aim?

174
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,956
Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.

175
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,191
Trust your eye.

176
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:31,397
There's someone out there.

177
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:52,451
That's about far enough.

178
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:58,590
We come as friends.

179
00:13:58,624 --> 00:14:00,425
<i>Begging</i>
<i>your pardon, m'lady,</i>

180
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:02,560
but we'll be
the judge of that.

181
00:14:04,863 --> 00:14:06,530
Valar morghulis.

182
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:08,599
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

183
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:47,405
My friends here
don't speak High Valyrian.

184
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,175
<i>Why are you here,</i>
<i>my lady?</i>

185
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:05,890
Forgive my manners.

186
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:08,926
I don't see many ladies
these days.

187
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,828
Lucky for the ladies.

188
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,392
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

189
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,261
Six.

190
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:12,157
I've always been
a terrible priest.

191
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:16,061
Drank too much rum.

192
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,196
Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.

193
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,932
It's a terrible
thing to say,

194
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:24,868
but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.

195
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:30,373
I decided that He,
that all the gods,

196
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:33,944
<i>were stories we told</i>
<i>the children to make them behave.</i>

197
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,716
So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,

198
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,819
but it was just for show.

199
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,558
A spectacle
for the locals.

200
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:50,028
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

201
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,570
I knelt beside
his cold body

202
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,405
and said the old words.

203
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,141
Not because I believed
in them, but...

204
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,414
he was my friend

205
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:09,750
and he was dead.

206
00:17:10,952 --> 00:17:12,887
And they were
the only words I knew.

207
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:17,424
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

208
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,761
Beric's eyes opened

209
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:24,530
<i>and I knew the truth.</i>

210
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:27,567
Our god
is the one true god.

211
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,304
And all men
must serve Him.

212
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:42,382
You've been
to the other side.

213
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,385
The other side?

214
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,289
There is no other side.

215
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:52,992
I have been
to the darkness, my lady.

216
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:59,800
He sent you to us
for a reason.

217
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:03,604
You have someone
He needs.

218
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,475
Bodkin point.

219
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,412
Penetrates plate
at 200 yards.

220
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,285
Can you make 'em?

221
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,687
Yeah, nothing tricky
about it.

222
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,023
Just need decent steel.

223
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,357
I'll get you the steel.

224
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,627
<i>Come on.</i>

225
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:27,897
<i>I don't like that woman.</i>

226
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:32,769
That's 'cause
you're a girl.

227
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:34,537
What does that have
to do with anything?

228
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:42,411
Forgive me, lad.

229
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,284
What are you doing?
Let go of him.

230
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,953
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

231
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:52,787
He wants to be one of you.

232
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:55,089
He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!

233
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:57,291
We serve
the Lord of Light

234
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:59,527
and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.

235
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:02,163
Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?

236
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,272
You're not doing this
for your god.

237
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:12,974
You're doing it for gold.

238
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:15,176
We're doing it
for both, girl.

239
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:18,380
We can't defend the people
without weapons

240
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:20,682
and horses and food.

241
00:19:20,717 --> 00:19:24,387
And we can't get weapons
and horses and food without gold.

242
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:27,356
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

243
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,859
You told me
I could be one of you.

244
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:38,502
You are more
than they can ever be.

245
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:41,404
They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.

246
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,074
You will make kings
rise and fall.

247
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:59,022
You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.

248
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:06,296
I see a darkness in you.

249
00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:10,767
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--

250
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:12,803
brown eyes,

251
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,107
blue eyes,
green eyes.

252
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:19,310
Eyes you'll shut forever.

253
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:24,850
We will meet again.

254
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:42,797
You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?

255
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:54,575
You all right?

256
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,547
Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.

257
00:22:14,162 --> 00:22:17,264
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?

258
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:19,366
Wa--

259
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:24,438
Wa--? Wa--?

260
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,375
Water?

261
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:29,444
You want some water.

262
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:34,516
I wish I had
some for you.

263
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,900
So let's play a game.

264
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:55,305
Which body part
do you need the least?

265
00:22:56,908 --> 00:23:00,377
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

266
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,713
I'll tell you everything,
please.

267
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:07,284
But you've already
told me everything.

268
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,820
<i>Remember?</i>

269
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:12,290
Your daddy
was mean to you.

270
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,660
The Starks didn't
appreciate you.

271
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,297
One good bit, though.

272
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,532
The Stark boys,

273
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,268
they're still alive.

274
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:29,405
Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?

275
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:33,376
You failed, but I'm a better
hunter than you.

276
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:37,113
<i>Now...</i>

277
00:23:37,147 --> 00:23:39,115
how about
your little finger?

278
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,984
You don't use that
for much, do you?

279
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:44,187
No? Good.
Let's start with that.

280
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,900
You've been wondering
why you're here.

281
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:59,436
<i>Haven't you?</i>

282
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,304
<i>Where you are.</i>

283
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,106
Who I am.

284
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,942
Why I'm doing
this to you.

285
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,780
So guess.

286
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:12,049
<i>If you guess right,</i>

287
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,650
I'll tell you.

288
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,653
By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.

289
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,090
You win the game

290
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,192
if you can
figure out who I am

291
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,760
and why
I'm torturing you

292
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,130
and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.

293
00:24:29,033 --> 00:24:32,803
If I win,
you'll let me go?

294
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,607
If you think this has
a happy ending,

295
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,643
you haven't been
paying attention.

296
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:42,311
Please.

297
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:46,282
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

298
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,887
You first.

299
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,022
Where are we?

300
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:57,626
- The North.
- Too vague.

301
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,294
Deepwood Motte.

302
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:03,765
Terrible guess.

303
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:13,976
Now, where?

304
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:16,980
Last Hearth.

305
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:20,083
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

306
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,288
Karhold!

307
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,829
Karhold?

308
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:38,567
How did you know that?

309
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,006
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

310
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,640
No.

311
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:47,243
It was just a guess.

312
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,781
Very good, Lord Theon.

313
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,718
And who am I?

314
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,921
Torrhen Karstark.

315
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,857
He's dead.

316
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,493
Strangled by
the Kingslayer.

317
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,830
He was your brother.

318
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:15,605
Your father
is Lord Rickard Karstark.

319
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:27,382
- You swore to tell me if I--
- You're right.

320
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:33,054
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

321
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,022
<i>I betrayed Robb.</i>

322
00:26:35,057 --> 00:26:38,659
That's why you're
torturing me.

323
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,630
Yes.

324
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:47,802
You win.

325
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,849
Of course, you forgot
to ask one question.

326
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:05,386
You forgot to ask
if I'm a liar.

327
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,795
I'm afraid I am.

328
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:19,000
Everything I told you
is a lie.

329
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:24,507
This isn't happening
to you for a reason.

330
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:28,277
Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.

331
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:31,548
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!

332
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:39,289
I win.

333
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,992
Thank you for riding
here so quickly.

334
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:44,527
I know travel
isn't easy in these times.

335
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,297
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

336
00:27:47,331 --> 00:27:50,801
But when the King
of the North summons us, we come.

337
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,236
<i>Our father has</i>
<i>instructed us to tell you</i>

338
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,006
that his alliance
with the North can continue

339
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,709
if his terms are met.

340
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,678
Lord Frey requires
a formal apology

341
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,714
for your violation
of your sacred oath

342
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,082
to marry one
of his daughters.

343
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,218
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

344
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,687
As restitution
for this betrayal,

345
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,824
<i>he demands Harrenhal</i>
<i>and all its attendant lands.</i>

346
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,193
- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.

347
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,196
Harrenhal is not
in the North.

348
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,900
It is his
once the war is over

349
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,569
and we have no further
strategic need for it.

350
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:30,405
And there's
something else.

351
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,241
We will do whatever we can
to give Lord Frey what he needs.

352
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:36,845
Not what, whom.

353
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,249
What?

354
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:47,223
No.

355
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:49,492
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

356
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:51,461
one of his daughters--
Roslin.

357
00:28:51,495 --> 00:28:53,330
How old is she?

358
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,598
19.

359
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,199
Could I see her first?

360
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,367
You want to count
her teeth?

361
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:00,136
<i>We depart for the Twins</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

362
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,205
<i>We need an answer</i>
<i>before we leave</i>

363
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,939
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

364
00:29:03,974 --> 00:29:06,008
or this alliance
is at an end.

365
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,611
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

366
00:29:08,645 --> 00:29:11,313
Father is old.

367
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:13,348
It will put
his heart at peace

368
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:16,250
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

369
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:19,120
And his recent experience
has made him wary

370
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:21,056
<i>of long engagements.</i>

371
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,891
He has every right to be.

372
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:26,227
Please excuse us
while we discuss it.

373
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:46,348
Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?

374
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:49,452
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

375
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm his liege lord.

376
00:29:50,954 --> 00:29:53,155
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

377
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,157
I didn't wound him.

378
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,826
My answer is no.

379
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,798
Listen to me

380
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,802
and listen very carefully.
You--

381
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:08,538
The laws of gods and men
are very clear.

382
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:11,040
No man can compel
another man to marry.

383
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,643
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

384
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:16,879
It's all right.
You heard him.

385
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:20,116
If you refuse, our alliance with
the Freys is dead.

386
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,552
He's wanted me for one
of his daughters since I was 12.

387
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:26,355
He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.

388
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,758
When I say no,
he will come back

389
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,793
and offer me a daughter
of my choosing.

390
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:32,662
You're willing to risk
our freedom

391
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:35,131
and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?

392
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:37,500
I have a war to fight.

393
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:39,535
We can't win it
without them.

394
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,404
I have no time to haggle.

395
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:43,573
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

396
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:47,511
You recall that
heroic engagement?

397
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:54,452
I had something
less permanent in mind.

398
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:56,921
I've won every battle,

399
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,790
but I'm losing this war.

400
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,795
If we don't do this
and do it now,

401
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,897
we're lost.

402
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,171
I'll marry her.

403
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,107
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.

404
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,977
It's not fair or right.

405
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,812
I'll remember it.

406
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,453
<i>I see my men have</i>
<i>finally found you</i>

407
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,555
<i>something appropriate</i>
<i>to wear.</i>

408
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:34,492
Yes. Most kind of them.

409
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,593
You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.

410
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:39,263
I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

411
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,298
<i>to return Jaime Lannister</i>
<i>to King's Landing.</i>

412
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,934
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

413
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,569
If she wasn't his mother,

414
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:48,704
<i>he'd have hanged her</i>
<i>for treason.</i>

415
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:58,179
I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

416
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:00,448
You should.

417
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:02,917
But instead,
you're sitting here

418
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:05,587
watching me fail at dinner.

419
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:07,789
Why might that be?

420
00:32:07,823 --> 00:32:09,691
Wars cost money.

421
00:32:09,725 --> 00:32:11,693
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

422
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:14,396
We both know
who would pay the most.

423
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,499
<i>Or make you pay the most</i>

424
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,200
if he found out
you had captured me

425
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:21,469
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

426
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,872
You're right.

427
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:27,709
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

428
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:29,678
It would be,

429
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:33,015
if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.

430
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:35,717
King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

431
00:32:35,752 --> 00:32:38,086
He doesn't have time
for anything else.

432
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:40,289
He'll make time for you.

433
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:45,127
As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

434
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:47,964
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

435
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:51,501
as restitution for the mistakes
my soldiers made.

436
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,904
And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,

437
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,474
that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.

438
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,916
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

439
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,456
You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?

440
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,926
Very well.

441
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,995
My lady,

442
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,098
may our journey continue
without further incident.

443
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,866
Oh, she won't be
going with you.

444
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,602
I am charged with
bringing Ser Jaime to--

445
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:28,404
<i>You are charged</i>
<i>with abetting treason.</i>

446
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,573
I'm afraid I must insist.

447
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,275
<i>You're in no place</i>
<i>to insist on anything.</i>

448
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:35,444
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

449
00:33:35,478 --> 00:33:39,314
about overplaying
your position.

450
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:45,454
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- Why?

451
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:47,823
My grandson is the pride
of Highgarden.

452
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:50,993
<i>The most desirable bachelor</i>
<i>in all seven kingdoms.</i>

453
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,629
- Your daughter--
- Is rich,

454
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:57,399
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms...

455
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:00,435
and the mother
of the king.

456
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,870
Old.

457
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:03,739
Old?

458
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:06,842
Old.

459
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:09,344
<i>I'm something of an expert</i>
<i>on the subject.</i>

460
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:11,980
<i>Her change will be</i>
<i>upon her before long.</i>

461
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:15,517
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

462
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:18,253
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

463
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:20,689
but this is another
matter entirely.

464
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:24,359
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

465
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:30,766
My stomach remains
quite strong, however.

466
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,635
The only thing
that might turn it

467
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,372
are details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

468
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,608
- <i>Do you deny them?</i>
- Oh, not at all.

469
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,677
A sword swallower
through and through.

470
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:43,478
And a boy
with his affliction

471
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:45,514
should be grateful
for the opportunity

472
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:48,583
<i>to marry the most beautiful</i>
<i>woman in the kingdoms</i>

473
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,484
and remove the stain
from his name.

474
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:53,754
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

475
00:34:53,788 --> 00:34:55,789
Sons of your father's
bannermen,

476
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:57,658
squires, stable boys?

477
00:34:57,692 --> 00:34:59,993
Of course.

478
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:03,196
And you never...

479
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:05,265
No.

480
00:35:05,299 --> 00:35:07,300
Not once?

481
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:08,902
Not in any way?

482
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:10,804
Never.

483
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:13,774
I congratulate you
upon your restraint.

484
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:16,076
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

485
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,744
at each other
beneath the sheets.

486
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:20,347
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance

487
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:22,282
for unnatural behavior.

488
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,750
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

489
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:26,053
True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots

490
00:35:26,087 --> 00:35:29,256
over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...

491
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:33,027
brothers and sisters--

492
00:35:34,396 --> 00:35:36,597
where I come from,
that stain

493
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:39,100
would be very difficult
to wash out.

494
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:41,736
I will not breathe
further life

495
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:44,172
into a malicious lie
by discussing it.

496
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,809
Lie or not,

497
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:50,979
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

498
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,549
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

499
00:35:53,583 --> 00:35:55,617
and send them off
to kill Lannisters

500
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:58,687
and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.

501
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:00,789
I don't care
what people believe.

502
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:03,658
And neither do you.

503
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:07,262
As an authority on myself,
I must disagree.

504
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:11,467
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

505
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:14,403
then Joffrey
is no king at all

506
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:18,607
and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.

507
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:22,345
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

508
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:26,549
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

509
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:30,120
It is a chance
we simply cannot take.

510
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,689
The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.

511
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,926
All right.

512
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,494
I'll remove it for you.

513
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,330
If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,

514
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,233
I will name him
to the Kingsguard.

515
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:47,702
<i>I'm sure you're familiar</i>
<i>with the Kingsguard vows.</i>

516
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,737
He will never marry.

517
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,572
- He will never have children.
- Oh...

518
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:53,507
<i>The Tyrell name</i>
<i>will fade.</i>

519
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:56,210
And Highgarden will go
to the children

520
00:36:56,244 --> 00:36:57,745
of Joffrey
and Margaery.

521
00:36:57,779 --> 00:37:00,248
You would have
your grandson protected

522
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:02,117
by someone
who disgusts you?

523
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:05,754
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

524
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:09,125
who takes his vows
seriously.

525
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,994
So, shall I draw up
the order?

526
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,932
Or do you consent
to this marriage?

527
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:22,637
It's a rare enough thing--

528
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:26,575
a man who lives up
to his reputation.

529
00:38:19,426 --> 00:38:20,760
No!

530
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:42,149
We've gotta cut them loose!

531
00:38:42,183 --> 00:38:44,451
No!

532
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,699
Take my hand!

533
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,639
<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>

534
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,176
Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.

535
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:19,883
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

536
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,591
I'm very happy about...

537
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,426
Uh, yes.

538
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,628
I-I am as well.

539
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,966
I feel like
I'm in a dream.

540
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,771
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.

541
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,340
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

542
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,575
The guests,

543
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,778
the food,
the tournaments.

544
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,385
And the bride,
of course.

545
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,825
The most beautiful bride
in the world

546
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:01,459
in a beautiful
gown of gold

547
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:04,062
and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.

548
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:08,734
Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?

549
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,503
No. I had never
left Winterfell

550
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:14,540
before I came
to King's Landing.

551
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:16,141
But it sounds wonderful.

552
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:18,777
I can't wait to see it.

553
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,913
And to leave this place.

554
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:23,783
It's terrible,
isn't it?

555
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:28,788
The most terrible
place there is.

556
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:41,534
<i>I don't suppose</i>
<i>there's anything we can do about this.</i>

557
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:43,836
We can have them
both killed.

558
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,606
It's hard to say
which of the four of us

559
00:41:47,641 --> 00:41:50,643
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

560
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,611
Probably Sansa.

561
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,480
Though Loras
will certainly come to know

562
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:57,283
a deep and singular misery.

563
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:00,053
Father doesn't
discriminate.

564
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:02,923
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

565
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:05,058
On a boat you built.

566
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:08,129
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

567
00:42:08,163 --> 00:42:10,699
I did what I did
to protect our family.

568
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:12,834
I'm your family.

569
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:15,804
A member of your family

570
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:18,874
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

571
00:42:19,942 --> 00:42:21,709
Whether or not
you or Father

572
00:42:21,744 --> 00:42:23,745
or anyone else
wants to admit it.

573
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,081
I do admit it.

574
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,750
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

575
00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:32,087
Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.

576
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:35,190
<i>Our heads would still be</i>
<i>rotting on the city gate.</i>

577
00:42:35,225 --> 00:42:39,561
Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.

578
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:43,766
There are two people
in King's Landing

579
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,967
who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.

580
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:48,971
Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon

581
00:42:49,005 --> 00:42:51,907
<i>to kill me during the Battle</i>
<i>of the Blackwater?</i>

582
00:43:01,483 --> 00:43:03,918
The impulse I understand.

583
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:08,056
He hates me
because I'm the only one

584
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,959
who tells him
what he really is.

585
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:18,266
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.

586
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:20,302
But his stupidity?

587
00:43:20,336 --> 00:43:24,339
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

588
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:27,842
But the king
orders a Kingsguard

589
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:30,045
to murder
the Hand of the King

590
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,980
in full view
of his own army.

591
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:33,548
The boy's an idiot.

592
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:34,983
What do you
want me to say?

593
00:43:35,017 --> 00:43:38,019
I want you to tell me if my life
is still in danger.

594
00:43:38,054 --> 00:43:39,788
Probably.

595
00:43:39,822 --> 00:43:41,523
But not from Joffrey.

596
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:43,725
He won't do anything
now Father's here.

597
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:47,997
Seven kingdoms
united in fear

598
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:50,165
of Tywin Lannister.

599
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,568
Not the Tyrells.

600
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,637
Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.

601
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:56,105
Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,

602
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,040
the little
doe-eyed whore.

603
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:01,076
And so will his children
and their children.

604
00:44:01,111 --> 00:44:03,346
History will be taken
from our hands.

605
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,917
You may escape,
at least.

606
00:44:07,951 --> 00:44:09,585
Once Jaime gets back,

607
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,121
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

608
00:44:12,156 --> 00:44:15,358
of sword through bowels.

609
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:17,360
When Jaime gets back, yes.

610
00:44:17,394 --> 00:44:19,062
But when do we think
that's going to be?

611
00:44:19,096 --> 00:44:20,930
He's out there somewhere.

612
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:26,603
Jaime or not,
I'm truly fucked.

613
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:31,809
Who's going to tell her?

614
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:35,545
Do you think
people will like it?

615
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,081
I don't think they
will even notice it.

616
00:44:38,115 --> 00:44:40,584
You're right.
It's not my wedding.

617
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:43,554
Anyway, from what
I can tell,

618
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:45,756
the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior

619
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:47,357
to the ones
in King's Landing.

620
00:44:47,392 --> 00:44:50,727
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

621
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,631
Loras likes green
and gold brocade.

622
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,533
I'm sure he does.

623
00:44:58,002 --> 00:44:59,936
Will they let me
invite my family?

624
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:02,372
They haven't asked
my opinion.

625
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:04,775
But do you think
they will?

626
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:06,410
No.

627
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:15,051
Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.

628
00:45:15,086 --> 00:45:17,921
- Should I--
- I beg your pardon, my lady.

629
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:20,324
Good afternoon,
Lord Tyrion.

630
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:22,894
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

631
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:28,833
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

632
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:31,269
I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.

633
00:45:31,304 --> 00:45:32,804
Of course.

634
00:45:32,838 --> 00:45:35,507
Alone, if I may.

635
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:37,242
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

636
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,078
Shae.

637
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,879
Please excuse her,
Lord Tyrion.

638
00:45:40,914 --> 00:45:42,415
<i>She's not from here.</i>

639
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:43,649
But I trust her,

640
00:45:43,683 --> 00:45:45,952
even though
she tells me not to.

641
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:51,458
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something

642
00:45:51,492 --> 00:45:54,561
<i>and it's only afterwards</i>
<i>when it's too late</i>

643
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:57,363
that we realize
we wished we'd heard it

644
00:45:57,398 --> 00:45:59,532
under entirely
different circumstances.

645
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:01,401
It's all right, really.

646
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:07,173
How to begin?

647
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:12,311
It's-- this--

648
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:15,982
this-- this is awkward.

649
00:46:18,018 --> 00:46:20,052
1,000 blades

650
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:23,155
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

651
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,592
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

652
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:29,362
There aren't
1,000 blades.

653
00:46:29,396 --> 00:46:31,964
There aren't even 200.

654
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:33,500
I've counted.

655
00:46:33,534 --> 00:46:36,169
Ha, I'm sure you have.

656
00:46:36,203 --> 00:46:38,939
Ugly old thing.

657
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:42,075
Yet it has
a certain appeal.

658
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,545
The Lysa Arryn
of chairs.

659
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,347
<i>Shame you had to settle</i>
<i>for your second choice.</i>

660
00:46:47,382 --> 00:46:49,650
Early days, my friend.

661
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:52,619
It is flattering,
really...

662
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:56,590
you feeling such dread

663
00:46:56,624 --> 00:46:59,092
at the prospect of me
getting what I want.

664
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:01,929
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition,

665
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:03,797
I promise you.

666
00:47:03,832 --> 00:47:07,234
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

667
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:08,535
You're so right.

668
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,371
For instance,

669
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:12,106
when I thwarted
your plan

670
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,208
to give Sansa Stark
to the Tyrells.

671
00:47:14,242 --> 00:47:16,343
If I'm going
to be honest,

672
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:18,245
I did feel
an unmistakable sense

673
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:21,748
of enjoyment there.

674
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:24,384
But your confidant,

675
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:27,888
the one who fed you information
about my plans,

676
00:47:27,922 --> 00:47:30,657
the one you swore
to protect...

677
00:47:31,993 --> 00:47:34,594
you didn't bring her
any enjoyment.

678
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:39,232
And she didn't bring me
any enjoyment.

679
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:42,469
She was a bad
investment on my part.

680
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:47,307
Luckily, I have a friend

681
00:47:47,341 --> 00:47:49,709
who wanted to try
something new.

682
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:53,246
Something daring.

683
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:57,083
And he was so grateful
to me for providing

684
00:47:57,118 --> 00:48:00,386
this fresh experience.

685
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:07,259
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

686
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:09,928
The realm?

687
00:48:09,962 --> 00:48:12,363
Do you know
what the realm is?

688
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:17,335
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

689
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:22,307
A story we agree to tell
each other over and over

690
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:24,809
till we forget
that it's a lie.

691
00:48:24,843 --> 00:48:29,414
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

692
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,383
Chaos.

693
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:34,119
A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.

694
00:48:34,153 --> 00:48:37,689
Chaos isn't a pit.

695
00:48:37,724 --> 00:48:40,091
Chaos is a ladder.

696
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:44,762
<i>Many who try</i>
<i>to climb it fail</i>

697
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,231
<i>and never get</i>
<i>to try again.</i>

698
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:50,901
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

699
00:48:59,344 --> 00:49:03,046
<i>And some are given</i>
<i>a chance to climb,</i>

700
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:05,548
<i>but they refuse.</i>

701
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:08,918
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

702
00:49:08,952 --> 00:49:10,953
<i>or the gods</i>

703
00:49:10,987 --> 00:49:13,422
<i>or love.</i>

704
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:15,691
<i>Illusions.</i>

705
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:19,661
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

706
00:49:19,696 --> 00:49:22,998
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>
