1
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,868
<i>How many of those fingers</i>

2
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:10,303
<i>do you think we could</i>
<i>shove up his ass?</i>

3
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,072
<i>Depends if he's had</i>
<i>any practice.</i>

4
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:16,075
Is that the sort of thing you and
your sister go in for, Kingslayer?

5
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,845
She loosened you up for us?

6
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,286
He's going to fall.

7
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,922
He's going to fall off his horse.
Someone help him.

8
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,997
Water.

9
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,032
Water.

10
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,667
Please, water.

11
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:49,203
Wa-water.

12
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,871
Water, please.

13
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,805
Please. Please.

14
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,347
If I die,
you won't be getting--

15
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,815
Oh, enough.

16
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:05,950
Here.

17
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,157
Can't say that I've ever seen a
man drink horse piss that fast.

18
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:44,450
Stop!

19
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:53,757
Far enough.

20
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:27,785
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

21
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:34,024
Come on, you.

22
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,334
Oh, Lord Tyrion.
Come in, come in.

23
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,470
I hope we might speak.

24
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,172
In confidence.

25
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:54,108
Oh, always in confidence.

26
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,877
About the events
of the Blackwater.

27
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,879
Perhaps this is
the wrong time?

28
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,782
Oh, no.
It's a wonderful time.

29
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,484
I thought one
of your little birds

30
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,286
might have knowledge of
my sister's intentions to--

31
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,788
End your life?

32
00:05:07,822 --> 00:05:10,657
I didn't inherit
Littlefinger's spies

33
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,225
along with his position,
I'm afraid.

34
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,293
Which is why
I'm coming to you.

35
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:16,562
- I need proof.
- Proof?

36
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:18,997
- Will there be a trial?
- I need to know.

37
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:23,134
I have no proof,
only whispers.

38
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,740
Before all this nastiness,

39
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:33,343
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

40
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:35,079
Do you want
to hear it still?

41
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,514
I don't know.
Do I?

42
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:40,283
As a boy, I travelled
with a troupe of actors

43
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:42,285
through the Free Cities.

44
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,087
One day in Myr,

45
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:46,956
a certain man
made my master an offer

46
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,058
too tempting to refuse.

47
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:51,660
I feared the man meant
to use me as I'd heard

48
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,695
some men used small boys.

49
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,431
But what he wanted
was far worse.

50
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,100
He gave me a potion

51
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:01,235
that made me powerless
to move or speak,

52
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,271
yet did nothing
to dull my senses.

53
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,706
With a hooked blade
he sliced me,

54
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,676
root and stem,
chanting all the while.

55
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,312
He burned my parts
in a brazier.

56
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:14,881
The flames turned blue

57
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:18,584
and I heard a voice
answer his call.

58
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:27,091
I still dream of that night.

59
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:29,560
Not of the sorcerer,

60
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,862
not of his blade.

61
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:34,331
I dream of the voice
from the flames.

62
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:36,567
Was it a god?
A demon?

63
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:38,269
A conjuror's trick?

64
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:40,437
I don't know.

65
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:43,941
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

66
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,376
And ever since that day,

67
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:50,180
I have hated magic and
all those who practice it.

68
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:52,616
But you can see
why I was eager to aid

69
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,018
in your fight against
Stannis and his Red Priestess.

70
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:59,755
A symbolic revenge of sorts.

71
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,825
Yes, ahem. I feel the
need for actual revenge

72
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,860
against the actual person

73
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:08,394
who tried
to have me killed.

74
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,764
Which will require a degree
of influence, which--

75
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,132
You do not possess

76
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,868
at the moment.

77
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,204
But influence is largely

78
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,373
a matter of patience,
I have found.

79
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:25,776
Once I had served
the sorcerer's purpose,

80
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,378
he threw me out
of his house to die.

81
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,148
I resolved to live

82
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:32,615
to spite him.

83
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,183
<i>I begged.</i>

84
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:37,419
I sold what parts
of my body remained to me.

85
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:39,788
I became
an excellent thief

86
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:43,190
and soon learned that the
contents of a man's letters

87
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:47,293
<i>are more valuable</i>
<i>than the contents of his purse.</i>

88
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,763
Step by step,

89
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:52,565
one distasteful task
after another,

90
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,068
I made my way
from the slums of Myr

91
00:07:56,103 --> 00:07:59,338
to the small council chamber.

92
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:04,209
Influence grows like a weed.

93
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,979
I tended mine patiently

94
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:11,382
until its tendrils
reached from the Red Keep

95
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:14,752
all the way across
to the far side of the world

96
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,722
where I managed to wrap
them around something

97
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:20,857
very special.

98
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:28,530
The sorcerer.

99
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:31,999
Hello, my old friend.

100
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:35,201
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

101
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,404
I have no doubt
the revenge you want

102
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:40,006
will be yours in time...

103
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,075
if you have
the stomach for it.

104
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,479
When people talk about
the Night's Watch,

105
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:50,948
they never mention
the shoveling.

106
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:53,217
Or the shit.

107
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:55,952
They tell you about honor,
pardoning crimes,

108
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:57,386
and protecting the realm,

109
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,756
but shoveling
really is most of it.

110
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,493
And getting attacked
or killed or worse.

111
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,995
And that. But when you're not
getting attacked or killed,

112
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,329
usually you're shoveling.

113
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:12,132
Oh, look.

114
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,900
More shit.

115
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,835
I was starting
to wonder what to do

116
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,637
with the rest of my day.

117
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:21,006
We need to get
out of here.

118
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:24,542
When the Lord Commander
says we go, we go.

119
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,511
The Lord Commander told us to go
to the Fist of the First Men.

120
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:30,346
- How'd that turn out for us?
- He had no way of knowing.

121
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:31,848
We do now.

122
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:33,583
We know what's out there.

123
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:36,652
Craster's been out here
surviving.

124
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:39,288
So he's your
new protector now?

125
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:40,822
Our good friend Craster?

126
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:42,557
We're like the sons
he never had.

127
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:45,160
<i>Mormont isn't</i>
<i>gonna save you.</i>

128
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:48,530
This lummox here
isn't gonna save you.

129
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:49,898
When the walkers
come calling,

130
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,600
Craster will serve us up
like so many pigs.

131
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:55,969
If we want to live...

132
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:00,606
we'll have to look out
for ourselves.

133
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:03,909
Shh, shh, shh.

134
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:17,586
- You woke him.
- I'm sorry.

135
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:22,056
- He's beautiful.
- Shh!

136
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:28,629
He's beautiful.

137
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:30,697
<i>Does he have a name?</i>

138
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:34,333
- No.
- Are you going to give him one?

139
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,901
Why?

140
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,039
Here.

141
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:42,534
Gilly.

142
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,508
You said to hold it for you
until you came back.

143
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,043
- You're back.
- I wanted you to have it.

144
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,044
I don't want
your stupid thimble.

145
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,347
I want to save my baby's life.
Can you do that?

146
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,416
Can you?

147
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:57,352
I don't have time
for you.

148
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:59,687
I don't have time
for anyone but him

149
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,924
because he doesn't
have much time.

150
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,347
You have to go
after him.

151
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:32,249
How?

152
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,350
<i>You know how.</i>

153
00:11:57,473 --> 00:12:00,174
Brandon.

154
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:00,877
Mother.

155
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,358
How many times
have I told you?

156
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,046
- No climbing.
- Mother, I need to find it.

157
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,814
- It's here. It's calling me.
- I want you to promise me.

158
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:09,782
No more climbing.
Promise me.

159
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:11,483
Promise me!
Promise me!

160
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:13,819
- Mother! Mother!
- Promise me! Promise me, Bran!

161
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:15,087
<i>Promise me!</i>

162
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,434
Is he very large?

163
00:12:30,469 --> 00:12:32,236
No larger than usual,
apparently.

164
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,305
- And yet they said that he was--
- Extraordinary.

165
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,941
The most extraordinary man
they've ever had.

166
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,408
And they've had
a lot of men.

167
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:41,443
We're talking about
the same Podrick?

168
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:44,012
The quiet boy
in Lord Tyrion's service?

169
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,614
Seems a bit simple?

170
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:48,650
What did he do to them?

171
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,950
I don't know, my lord.

172
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:52,353
The girls are usually
quite descriptive.

173
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:54,321
So what did they say?

174
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:57,390
They said it was hard
to describe.

175
00:12:57,425 --> 00:12:58,992
Huh.

176
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:03,763
Prodigies appear
in the oddest of places.

177
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:08,000
And what did Littlefinger say
about this loss of income?

178
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,102
He was too preoccupied
to notice.

179
00:13:10,136 --> 00:13:12,437
He's leaving
for the Eyrie soon.

180
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:13,971
I'm helping him prepare
for his journey.

181
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:16,606
Ah, yes, to pursue
his enduring love

182
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:20,143
of the Lady Arryn and the
title that comes with her.

183
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:22,278
Sad, really.

184
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:24,279
Is that all it takes

185
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:27,415
to make our friend lose
interest in poor Sansa Stark?

186
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,985
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time,

187
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,820
as far as I know.

188
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,489
But I don't think
he's lost interest.

189
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,624
What makes you say so?

190
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:42,028
- His shipboard inventory.
- Ah.

191
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,331
You can read.

192
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:47,432
Rare for a woman
in your profession.

193
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:50,467
- Former profession.
- Of course.

194
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:54,070
I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

195
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:56,005
<i>Two featherbeds.</i>

196
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,574
He's bringing two featherbeds
for the cabin.

197
00:14:00,377 --> 00:14:02,912
Who is important enough
to Littlefinger

198
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,748
to merit a featherbed
besides Littlefinger?

199
00:14:05,782 --> 00:14:08,017
Could he be bringing
one of his girls?

200
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,352
He's not interested
in them, my lord.

201
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,121
How do you know?

202
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,556
Because I'm one
of his girls.

203
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,025
Prodigies in
odd places indeed.

204
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:22,563
Rhaenyra Targaryen
was murdered by her brother,

205
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,065
or rather his dragon.

206
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:27,700
It ate her
while her son watched.

207
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,572
What's left of her is buried in
the crypts right down there.

208
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,677
<i>The ceremony is traditionally</i>
<i>held in the main sanctum,</i>

209
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,947
which seats
700 comfortably.

210
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,649
There appears to be a good
deal of room elsewhere

211
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,284
on the premises
for everyone else.

212
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:50,487
There aren't more than 700
people of any importance.

213
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:53,656
No, the rest are there
to look adoringly

214
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,724
upon the 700
to remind them

215
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,928
how superior they must be
to have the best seats.

216
00:14:58,962 --> 00:15:00,462
Over there in that urn,

217
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,831
the ashes
of Aerion Targaryen.

218
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:04,833
Aerion Brightflame
they called him.

219
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:08,036
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

220
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,272
He was wrong.

221
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:13,341
And, of course,
there's the Mad King,

222
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,109
killed by my uncle.

223
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:18,345
Would you like to see where the
last Targaryens are buried?

224
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,348
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't
find all this a bit macabre?

225
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,116
Oh, no, it's quite
all right, Your Grace.

226
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,718
I'd love to see
their tombs, really.

227
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:28,054
It's like taking a walk
through history.

228
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:34,326
- The tomb's just up here.
- This is so exciting.

229
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,000
You were married here,
Your Grace?

230
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:39,196
- Yes.
- Must seem like only yesterday.

231
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,997
Seems like a lifetime ago.

232
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:43,366
Your husband,
was he buried here as well?

233
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,502
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storm's End.

234
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:50,105
- Such a tragedy.
- A fairly predictable tragedy.

235
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,673
Hunting and drinking
don't mix.

236
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:53,275
I should say not.

237
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:55,377
My son's a hunter.
It helps him forget

238
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:58,279
he's never been within
a mile of a real battle.

239
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:01,282
I seem to recall he laid
siege to Storm's End

240
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:02,850
for the better part
of a year.

241
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,618
All he laid siege to

242
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:06,954
was the banquet table
in the command tent.

243
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:10,223
I told him to stay out
of Robert's rebellion.

244
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:13,760
He had no business
fighting an actual warrior.

245
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:17,229
We mothers
do what we can

246
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,431
to keep our sons
from the grave.

247
00:16:19,465 --> 00:16:21,466
But they do seem
to yearn for it.

248
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,234
We shower them
with good sense,

249
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:27,771
and it slides right off
like rain off a wing.

250
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:30,774
And yet the world
belongs to them.

251
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:33,710
A ridiculous arrangement,
to my mind.

252
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,614
The gods have seen fit
to make it so.

253
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,316
My father didn't
want them here.

254
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,984
He was going to have
their bodies burned

255
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,685
and thrown
in the Blackwater,

256
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,221
but the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

257
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,890
I'm glad he did.

258
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,292
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

259
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:57,060
I know they did
terrible things at the end,

260
00:16:57,095 --> 00:17:00,997
but their ancestors
built this.

261
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:04,833
Sometimes severity

262
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,001
is the price we pay
for greatness.

263
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:11,339
I couldn't agree more.

264
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,383
Shall we go and see them?

265
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,852
If you give them
your love,

266
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:29,322
they will return it
a thousandfold.

267
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:31,858
I've spoken with them.

268
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:34,226
I know how they feel
about you.

269
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,696
You led the defense
of King's Landing.

270
00:17:39,198 --> 00:17:41,433
They adore you.

271
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:51,976
Open the doors.

272
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:01,317
Joffrey.

273
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:04,153
Wait.

274
00:18:05,422 --> 00:18:07,089
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

275
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:09,891
Bless you,
Lady Margaery!

276
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:12,360
- Lady Margaery!
- Lady Margaery!

277
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:15,430
- <i>Margaery!</i>
- <i>Long live Lady Margaery!</i>

278
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:17,965
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

279
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:23,236
<i>King Joffrey!</i>
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

280
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,371
<i>King Joffrey!</i>

281
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,673
<i>Gods bless King Joffrey!</i>

282
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,412
How far is it
to Deepwood Motte?

283
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,013
Not far, my lord.

284
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,015
Your sister is waiting
for you there.

285
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,850
- She sent you to save me?
- Yes.

286
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:44,720
I served them, the men
who were torturing you.

287
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:47,323
I did what they told me and
waited for the right moment.

288
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,725
Why would you risk
your life for me?

289
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,761
I grew up
on Saltcliffe, my lord.

290
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:55,930
I was only a boy
when they took you away.

291
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,932
My father brought me and my
brothers up to the bluffs

292
00:18:57,966 --> 00:19:00,968
so we could watch the ship
that carried you off.

293
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:04,037
I remember the look on my
father's face when he told us,

294
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:06,873
"That's Balon Greyjoy's
last living son."

295
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:10,609
And those are the words
I heard over and over again

296
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:12,944
when I saw what
they were doing to you.

297
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,979
Those men,

298
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:18,015
they said my father knew
what they were doing to me.

299
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,918
Did he?

300
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,888
I-- I don't know,
my lord.

301
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:28,391
They-- they never
told me much.

302
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,000
My sister's men
are loyal to her.

303
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:41,202
<i>We don't need</i>
<i>to hide from them.</i>

304
00:19:41,237 --> 00:19:43,271
Not all those
are your sister's men.

305
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:46,006
Some of them are loyal
to your father.

306
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:51,343
What is it?

307
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:52,978
I was just thinking
how jealous I was

308
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,147
when my father told Yara
to take this place.

309
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:56,948
What did he tell
you to do?

310
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:59,183
Raid fishing villages.

311
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:01,052
He didn't trust me.

312
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:02,853
Thought I was a Stark.

313
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,823
Ha. I could never
be a Stark.

314
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:08,325
Robb Stark always
reminded me of that.

315
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,861
- He lorded it over you?
- Didn't have to.

316
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:14,063
All he had to do was be.

317
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:18,101
Be who he was born to be.

318
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:20,603
His life fit him
better than his clothes.

319
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:23,139
How could someone like that
ever be a brother to me?

320
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:25,441
<i>He's the King</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

321
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,775
<i>And me...</i>

322
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,477
my father gave me
a choice

323
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,412
and I made it.

324
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,749
I could never
be a Stark.

325
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:38,252
But ironborn,

326
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,922
that's what
I was born to be.

327
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:48,362
I paid the iron price
for Winterfell.

328
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:56,970
I murdered those boys.

329
00:21:00,107 --> 00:21:01,874
The Stark boys?

330
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:04,977
Never found them.

331
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:08,647
Just some poor orphans
living with a farmer.

332
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,851
I let Dagmer
slit their throats

333
00:21:14,886 --> 00:21:17,054
and I let him
burn the bodies...

334
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,491
so I could keep
Winterfell...

335
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:26,029
and make my father proud.

336
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,532
Maybe it's not too late.

337
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:34,703
It is.

338
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,745
My real father lost his head
at King's Landing.

339
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,816
I made a choice...

340
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,386
and I chose wrong.

341
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:59,557
And now I've burned
everything down.

342
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:03,594
Not everything,
my lord.

343
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,730
She's up here.

344
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:22,642
- Yara.
- <i>Shh.</i>

345
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,211
Wait.

346
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,321
I brought him back.
He killed the others.

347
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,189
What?
No, I didn't.

348
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:39,391
You can't!

349
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:42,127
No, please stop!

350
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,464
No!

351
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,265
Put him back
where he belongs.

352
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:15,221
Eat.

353
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:20,759
What are you doing?

354
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:23,395
I'm dying.

355
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,397
You can't die.

356
00:23:26,432 --> 00:23:28,733
You need to live

357
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:31,235
to take revenge.

358
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:33,736
I don't care
about revenge.

359
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:35,738
You coward.

360
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:39,674
A little misfortune
and you're giving up.

361
00:23:41,243 --> 00:23:43,277
Misfor--

362
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:44,879
misfortune?

363
00:23:44,913 --> 00:23:46,680
You lost your hand.

364
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:49,449
My sword hand.
I was that hand.

365
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,020
You have a taste--

366
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:56,755
one taste
of the real world

367
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,892
where people have important
things taken from them

368
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:02,694
and you whine
and cry and quit.

369
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:05,196
You sound like
a bloody woman.

370
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,220
I know what
you did for me.

371
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:37,491
You told them Tarth
was full of sapphires.

372
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:43,462
It's called
the Sapphire Isle

373
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:45,665
because of the blue
of its water.

374
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:50,768
You knew that.

375
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:00,243
Why did you help me?

376
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:28,032
You wanted to speak to me?

377
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:30,434
Yes, about Jaime.

378
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:33,103
What about him?

379
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:34,537
I wanted to make sure

380
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:37,006
we're doing everything
we can to get him back.

381
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:43,211
When Catelyn Stark
took Tyrion prisoner...

382
00:25:44,814 --> 00:25:46,548
what did I do
in response?

383
00:25:46,582 --> 00:25:49,617
- You started a war.
- And if I would start a war

384
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:52,019
for that lecherous
little stump,

385
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:55,222
what do you think I am doing
for my oldest son and heir?

386
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:57,924
Whatever you can.

387
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,727
Whatever I can.

388
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,840
- You're still here.
- Yes.

389
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,011
Why?

390
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,445
Did it ever occur to you

391
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,480
that I might be the one
who deserves your confidence

392
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,982
and your trust,
not your sons?

393
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:28,885
Not Jaime or Tyrion,
but me.

394
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,120
Years and years
of lectures on family

395
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:33,222
and legacy--

396
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:34,756
the same lecture,
really,

397
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,093
just with tiny,
tedious variations--

398
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:39,861
did it ever occur to you
that your daughter

399
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,625
might be the only one
listening to them?

400
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,178
Living by them?

401
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:47,167
That she might have the most
to contribute to your legacy

402
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:50,103
that you love so much more
than your actual children?

403
00:26:57,144 --> 00:27:00,245
All right.
Contribute.

404
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:05,016
The Tyrells are a problem.

405
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:09,620
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

406
00:27:09,655 --> 00:27:12,923
The Tyrells saved your life,
your children's lives.

407
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,659
Margaery has her claws
in Joffrey.

408
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,662
She knows how
to manipulate him.

409
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:22,064
Good.

410
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,199
I wish you knew
how to manipulate him.

411
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:28,169
I don't distrust you
because you're a woman.

412
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:31,706
I distrust you because you're not
as smart as you think you are.

413
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,509
You've allowed that boy
to ride roughshod over you

414
00:27:34,543 --> 00:27:37,512
and everyone else
in this city.

415
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:44,886
Perhaps...

416
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,389
you should try stopping him
from doing what he likes.

417
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:54,862
I will.

418
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:58,098
<i>Do you like it, Nana?</i>

419
00:27:58,132 --> 00:28:01,000
Another golden rose.
How original.

420
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,436
I eat from plates
stamped with roses.

421
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,671
I sleep in sheets
embroidered with roses.

422
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:08,574
I have a golden rose
painted on my chamber pot,

423
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:11,009
as if that makes it
smell any better.

424
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:12,711
Roses are boring, dear.

425
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:15,280
"Growing strong."

426
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:18,415
Ha! The dullest words
of any house.

427
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,350
"Winter is coming!"

428
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:22,419
Now that's memorable.

429
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:25,521
"We do not sow."
Strong. Strong.

430
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,590
Those are houses
you watch out for.

431
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:31,760
Direwolves and krakens,
fierce beasts.

432
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,795
But a golden rose
growing strong--

433
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:37,198
ha, that strikes fear
in the heart.

434
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,668
Look, little loves.

435
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,603
A spider in the garden.

436
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,439
Run along now.

437
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,408
Grow strong.

438
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:51,977
My lady.

439
00:28:52,012 --> 00:28:55,347
I wanted to personally
welcome you to King's Landing.

440
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:57,849
The city has been made
brighter by your presence.

441
00:28:57,884 --> 00:29:00,952
The city is made brighter
by my presence?

442
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,354
Is that your usual line,
Lord Varys?

443
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:04,955
Are you here
to seduce me?

444
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,657
A little obvious,
perhaps.

445
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:08,592
Oh, no, please.

446
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:11,995
Seduce away.
It's been so long.

447
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,397
Though I rather think
it's all for naught.

448
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:18,067
What happens when the nonexistent
bumps against the decrepit?

449
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:21,370
A question for
the philosophers.

450
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:24,439
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

451
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,607
- So?
- Might I sit?

452
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,542
No.

453
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:31,744
Come, I've heard
you're such a clever man.

454
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:34,480
I'm curious why
you've sought me out.

455
00:29:35,682 --> 00:29:38,250
You've taken an interest
in Sansa Stark.

456
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:39,417
Have I?

457
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:41,319
Because I spoke to her
once in this garden

458
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:44,255
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

459
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,590
Why shouldn't I take
an interest?

460
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:47,391
- She's an interesting girl.
- Is she?

461
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:49,226
No, not particularly.

462
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,295
But she's had
an interesting childhood.

463
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:54,097
She has, sadly.

464
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:56,432
Well, forgive me for wasting
your time, then.

465
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:59,801
I thought we shared certain
hopes for her well-being.

466
00:29:59,836 --> 00:30:01,302
Come, come.

467
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:03,904
You surrender
rather easily.

468
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:06,774
Walk with me.

469
00:30:06,808 --> 00:30:08,542
I know the walls
have ears,

470
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:10,911
but apparently
the shrubbery does, too.

471
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:13,747
I choose my allies
carefully

472
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,749
and my enemies
more carefully still.

473
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,684
Which is Sansa Stark?

474
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:21,520
Neither.
A babe in the woods.

475
00:30:21,554 --> 00:30:23,755
- I admired her father.
- Yes.

476
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,890
Ned Stark
had many admirers,

477
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,358
and how many
stepped forward

478
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,960
when the executioner
came for his head?

479
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,561
I could not help
Lord Stark.

480
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:34,831
- Perhaps I can help his daughter.
- How?

481
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:38,334
You're not the only one who has
taken an interest in her.

482
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,135
That's hardly surprising.

483
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,504
She's a beautiful girl
with a famous name.

484
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:46,074
Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

485
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:48,976
It almost feels as if you're
about to arrive at the point.

486
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:51,645
Littlefinger is not long
for the capital.

487
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,680
A confidant of mine
has told me

488
00:30:53,714 --> 00:30:56,615
that when he goes,
Sansa Stark goes with him.

489
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,951
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

490
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:02,788
Littlefinger was born with no
lands, no wealth, no armies.

491
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:04,556
He has acquired
the first two.

492
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,324
How long before
he has the army?

493
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,459
Perhaps you'll laugh,

494
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,527
but I know him
better than most

495
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:12,763
and this is the truth.

496
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:17,401
Littlefinger is one of the most
dangerous men in Westeros.

497
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:19,803
If Robb Stark falls,

498
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,238
Sansa Stark is the key
to the North.

499
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:25,240
And if Littlefinger marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket.

500
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:27,042
Which seems such a shame.

501
00:31:27,076 --> 00:31:29,177
Why should a man
with such a low reputation

502
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:31,179
steal away
such a lovely bride?

503
00:31:31,213 --> 00:31:33,280
You must despise him.

504
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:35,448
You're working so hard
to undermine him.

505
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:38,417
Actually,
I rather enjoy him.

506
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:40,552
But he would see
this country burn

507
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:42,987
if he could be
king of the ashes.

508
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:45,056
You are a clever man,
Lord Varys.

509
00:31:45,091 --> 00:31:46,624
You are too kind.

510
00:31:46,658 --> 00:31:49,593
I believe I have
a possible solution.

511
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,395
One doesn't need
to be clever for that.

512
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:52,996
It's all rather obvious,
isn't it?

513
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,173
Ahem.

514
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,241
I didn't mean
to disturb you.

515
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:10,009
You haven't.

516
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:11,811
We'd like
some privacy, please.

517
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:14,046
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

518
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,483
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

519
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:21,419
I'll ask the king
to speak with you himself.

520
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:27,124
What did you pray for?

521
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,793
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

522
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:32,528
I'll tell you what I prayed for
in the sept this morning.

523
00:32:32,563 --> 00:32:36,365
Let's see, for my family's
health and happiness,

524
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,634
for an end to the war,
for a short winter.

525
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:42,303
Boring and traditional,
I'm afraid.

526
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:46,139
- And you?
- I'm sorry, I just can't.

527
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,741
My cousin Alanna

528
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:50,310
was the most beautiful
girl I'd ever seen.

529
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,478
When I was 12, I was
all elbows and knees

530
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:54,980
and Alanna looked like a
goddess sent to torture me.

531
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,815
Pig-face, she called me.

532
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,717
Pig-face?
That's ridiculous.

533
00:32:58,751 --> 00:33:00,986
I think it had something
to do with my nose.

534
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,421
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

535
00:33:06,492 --> 00:33:09,293
So I prayed that she'd catch
a horrible skin disease.

536
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:11,762
A week after that, she came
down with porridge plague.

537
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:14,397
- Porridge plague?
- You don't have it in the North?

538
00:33:14,432 --> 00:33:16,833
Your skin starts
to look like boiled oats

539
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:19,668
and eventually your face
slides off and you diein agony.

540
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:21,603
But that's awful.

541
00:33:23,806 --> 00:33:26,341
You're--

542
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,343
I believed you!

543
00:33:28,377 --> 00:33:30,278
Porridge plague.
I'm an idiot.

544
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,513
Don't say that.
No, you're not.

545
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:35,148
So what happened
to Alanna?

546
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,283
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

547
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:40,252
and married a handsome lord
and they have darling children

548
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:42,087
and live in a castle
by the sea.

549
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,723
It's all terribly
frustrating.

550
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:47,459
I'm sure she's jealous
of you now.

551
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,760
You'll be married
here in the capital

552
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,463
and she'll have to come watch and
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

553
00:33:56,267 --> 00:34:00,036
I want us to be friends,
good friends.

554
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,271
That would make me
very happy.

555
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:05,740
You must see Highgarden.

556
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:07,809
You'd love it there.
I know you would.

557
00:34:07,843 --> 00:34:10,744
We have a great masquerade the
night of the harvest moon.

558
00:34:10,779 --> 00:34:12,212
You should see
the costumes.

559
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:13,948
People work on them
for months.

560
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:17,417
I-- I don't think
the queen

561
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:18,952
would let me leave
King's Landing.

562
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:20,786
The Queen Regent,
you mean.

563
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:23,188
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

564
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:29,294
And if you were
to marry Loras...

565
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:35,499
Oh, your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

566
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,902
We would be sisters,
you and I.

567
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:40,870
Would you like that?

568
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,351
His name was Bannen.

569
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:59,086
He was a good man,

570
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,055
a good ranger.

571
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:03,223
He came to us from--

572
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,860
where did he come from?

573
00:35:06,894 --> 00:35:09,629
Down White Harbor way.

574
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:11,797
He came to us
from White Harbor.

575
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:14,866
Never failed
in his duty.

576
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,002
He kept his vows
the best he could.

577
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:21,939
He rode far,
fought fiercely.

578
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:26,476
We shall never see
his like again.

579
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:29,946
And now his watch
has ended.

580
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:33,749
And now his watch
has ended.

581
00:35:38,087 --> 00:35:41,355
Didn't think a broke foot
could kill a man.

582
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,257
It wasn't his foot
that killed him.

583
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:46,960
That bastard Craster
starved him to death.

584
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:48,795
Craster's got
his daughters to feed.

585
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:50,229
<i>You on his side?</i>

586
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:53,332
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

587
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:56,001
We're brothers
of the Night's Watch, not thieves.

588
00:35:56,035 --> 00:35:57,836
The day we leave,

589
00:35:57,903 --> 00:36:01,472
Craster will tap
a barrel of our wine

590
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:04,643
<i>and sit down to a feast</i>
<i>of ham and potatoes</i>

591
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:06,645
<i>and laugh at us</i>

592
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:08,914
starving in the snow.

593
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:13,618
He's a bloody wildling
is all he is.

594
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:19,656
Never knew Bannen
could smell so good.

595
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:33,802
You have one son,
don't you, Mormont?

596
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:37,571
I had my 99th.

597
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:41,742
You ever meet a man
with 99 sons?

598
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:47,013
And more daughters
than I can count.

599
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:49,448
- I'm glad for you.
- Are you now?

600
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:53,152
Me, I'll be glad when you
and yours have gone.

601
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:55,254
As soon as our wounded
are strong enough.

602
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:57,222
Ah.

603
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,357
They're as strong
as they're gonna get.

604
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:02,660
Them that's dying,

605
00:37:02,694 --> 00:37:04,795
why don't you cut their throats
and be done with it?

606
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:06,797
<i>Hmm?</i>

607
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:10,032
<i>Or leave them</i>
<i>if you've not the stomach</i>

608
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,600
and I'll sort them myself.

609
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:15,804
<i>Whose throat you</i>
<i>gonna cut, old man?</i>

610
00:37:19,241 --> 00:37:20,575
Wait outside.

611
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:24,011
It's cold outside
and there's nothing to eat.

612
00:37:24,046 --> 00:37:25,546
My wives gave you bread.

613
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,816
There's sawdust
in the bread.

614
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,384
You don't like it,

615
00:37:30,418 --> 00:37:32,786
you go out there
and eat the snow.

616
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:41,526
I'd rather eat what
you've got hidden away.

617
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:46,596
I told you
to wait outside.

618
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,464
He's sitting there
drinking our wine,

619
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,199
eating his fill
while we die.

620
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:53,869
I gave you crows enough.

621
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:55,170
I've got to feed
my women!

622
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:57,104
So you admit you've got
a hidden larder, then?

623
00:37:57,139 --> 00:37:58,619
How else'd you make it
through winter?

624
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,643
Enough!
Out!

625
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:03,545
I am a godly man.

626
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,079
You're a stingy bastard!

627
00:38:05,113 --> 00:38:06,480
Bastard?

628
00:38:06,515 --> 00:38:10,017
Out with you,
you little thief.

629
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:13,420
And you!
And you!

630
00:38:15,156 --> 00:38:17,690
Go sleep in the cold
on empty bellies.

631
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,827
I'll chop the hands
off the next man

632
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:24,196
who calls me bastard.

633
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,910
You are a bastard.

634
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:47,081
A daughter-fucking,
wildling bastard.

635
00:38:54,956 --> 00:38:56,890
The gods will
curse us for this.

636
00:38:56,925 --> 00:38:58,246
By all the laws--

637
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:00,146
There are no laws
beyond the Wall.

638
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:01,827
Now show us where
he hides the food

639
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:03,962
or you'll get
the same as he did.

640
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:06,398
Unhand her.

641
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:08,299
I shall have your head for this.

642
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:02,113
- Quickly. Quickly.
- What's happening?

643
00:40:02,147 --> 00:40:05,715
- I'm not going out there.
- No, we have to go. Now!

644
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:13,421
Follow me.
I know the best way.

645
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:17,158
Come on.

646
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,731
Run fast, Piggy,

647
00:40:24,765 --> 00:40:27,066
and sleep well!

648
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:30,036
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

649
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,874
Can I take
this hood off yet?

650
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:38,642
I do apologize,
little lady,

651
00:40:38,677 --> 00:40:41,378
but it's better for you if you
don't see where we're going.

652
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:45,548
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

653
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,884
Halt!

654
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:56,790
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

655
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:59,326
Ugh!

656
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,628
Not easy finding
molasses in wartime.

657
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,529
I'd have some.

658
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,533
Let's go home.

659
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:27,315
<i>What is this place?</i>

660
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:30,451
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

661
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:42,228
You look like
a bunch of swineherds.

662
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:44,297
<i>Some of us</i>
<i>were swineherds.</i>

663
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,999
And some of us tanners
and masons.

664
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:48,400
That was before.

665
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:50,369
You're still swineherds

666
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:53,305
and tanners
and masons.

667
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,341
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

668
00:41:56,376 --> 00:41:59,577
No.

669
00:41:59,611 --> 00:42:02,913
Fighting in a war
makes you a soldier.

670
00:42:02,947 --> 00:42:04,981
Beric Dondarrion?

671
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:06,716
<i>You've seen better days.</i>

672
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,285
And I won't see them again.

673
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:12,688
Stark deserters.

674
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:15,323
Baratheon deserters.

675
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:16,925
You lot aren't
fighting in a war.

676
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,459
You're running from it.

677
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,795
Last I heard, you were
King Joffrey's guard dog.

678
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:24,698
But here you are
1,000 miles from home.

679
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:26,433
Which of us is running?

680
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:28,535
Untie these ropes
and we'll find out.

681
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,272
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

682
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:35,107
Ned Stark ordered me
to execute your brother

683
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:36,441
<i>in King Robert's name.</i>

684
00:42:36,476 --> 00:42:38,944
Ned Stark is dead.

685
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:41,212
King Robert is dead.

686
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:43,448
My brother's alive.

687
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:47,651
You're fighting
for ghosts.

688
00:42:47,686 --> 00:42:49,553
That's what we are--

689
00:42:49,587 --> 00:42:53,424
ghosts waiting for you
in the dark.

690
00:42:53,458 --> 00:42:55,825
You can't see us,

691
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,794
but we see you.

692
00:42:57,828 --> 00:43:00,096
No matter whose cloak
you wear--

693
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,765
Lannister, Stark,
Baratheon--

694
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:04,800
you prey on the weak,

695
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:07,670
the Brotherhood without
Banners will hunt you down.

696
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:09,738
You found god?
Is that it?

697
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:12,407
Aye.
I've been reborn

698
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:14,408
in the light
of the one true god.

699
00:43:15,244 --> 00:43:16,944
<i>As have we all.</i>

700
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:19,479
<i>As would any man who's seen</i>
<i>the things we've seen.</i>

701
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,215
If you mean to murder me, then
bloody well get on with it.

702
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,418
You'll die
soon enough, dog.

703
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:28,988
But it won't be murder,
only justice.

704
00:43:29,022 --> 00:43:30,956
<i>And a kinder fate</i>
<i>than you deserve.</i>

705
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,490
<i>Lions you call</i>
<i>yourselves.</i>

706
00:43:32,525 --> 00:43:35,726
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped

707
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:37,994
<i>and babes</i>
<i>still on the breast</i>

708
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:39,696
were cut in two while
their mothers watched.

709
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,998
I wasn't at
the Mummer's Ford.

710
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:44,533
Dump your dead children
at some other door.

711
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:46,935
House Clegane was built
upon dead children.

712
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:49,504
I saw them lay Prince Aegon
and Princess Rhaenys

713
00:43:49,538 --> 00:43:51,072
before the Iron Throne.

714
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:52,839
Do you take me
for my brother?

715
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:55,342
Is being born
Clegane a crime?

716
00:43:55,376 --> 00:43:58,411
- Murder is a crime.
- I never touched the Targaryen babes.

717
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:01,247
I never saw them,
never smelled them,

718
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:03,149
never heard them bawling.

719
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:06,853
You want to cut my throat,
get on with it!

720
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:08,921
But don't call me murderer

721
00:44:08,956 --> 00:44:10,790
and pretend that you're not.

722
00:44:10,824 --> 00:44:12,859
You murdered Mycah.

723
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:14,393
The butcher's boy.

724
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:16,362
My friend.

725
00:44:16,396 --> 00:44:19,631
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed.

726
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:21,032
<i>And you rode him down.</i>

727
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:23,768
You slung him over your horse
like he was some deer.

728
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:26,370
Aye, he was a bleeder.

729
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,105
You don't deny
killing this boy?

730
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,773
I was Joffrey's
sworn shield.

731
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:32,809
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

732
00:44:32,843 --> 00:44:36,246
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.

733
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,914
Then I should have
killed you.

734
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:41,149
Not my place
to question princes.

735
00:44:42,652 --> 00:44:44,653
You stand accused of murder.

736
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:47,022
But no one here knows
the truth of the charge,

737
00:44:47,056 --> 00:44:49,391
so it is not for us
to judge you.

738
00:44:49,425 --> 00:44:52,227
Only the Lord of Light
may do that now.

739
00:44:54,229 --> 00:44:56,897
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

740
00:44:58,967 --> 00:45:01,368
So, who will it be?

741
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:04,304
Should we find out
if your fire god

742
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:06,639
really loves you, priest?

743
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:08,173
Or you, archer?

744
00:45:08,198 --> 00:45:10,425
What are you worth
with a sword in your hand?

745
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:14,245
Or is the little girl
the bravest one here?

746
00:45:16,382 --> 00:45:18,349
Aye.

747
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,451
She might be.

748
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,622
But it's me you'll fight.

749
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:50,846
The master says
they are untested.

750
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:57,051
He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

751
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:59,686
There are many small cities
between here and there,

752
00:45:59,721 --> 00:46:01,822
cities ripe for sacking.

753
00:46:03,758 --> 00:46:05,792
<i>Should you take captives,</i>

754
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:08,994
the masters will buy the healthy ones
and for a good price.

755
00:46:12,765 --> 00:46:15,066
<i>And who knows?</i>

756
00:46:15,101 --> 00:46:19,203
In 10 years, some of the boys
you send them

757
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:21,438
may be Unsullied
in their turn.

758
00:46:21,473 --> 00:46:23,607
Thus all shall prosper.

759
00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:20,354
Is it done, then?
They belong to me?

760
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:26,960
<i>It is done.</i>

761
00:47:26,994 --> 00:47:28,695
You hold the whip.

762
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:01,775
Dracarys.
