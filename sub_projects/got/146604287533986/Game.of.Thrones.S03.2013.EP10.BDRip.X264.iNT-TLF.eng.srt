1
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,130
<i>- Go, move out!</i>
<i>-  The King in the North!</i>

2
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,433
<i>The King in the North!</i>

3
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,569
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

4
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,071
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

5
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:56,440
Here comes
the King in the North!

6
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,675
Here comes the King
in the North!

7
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,643
<i>The King in the North!</i>
<i>The King in the North!</i>

8
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:04,546
Here comes...

9
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:34,038
Hmm.

10
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,674
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

11
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,142
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

12
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,743
What are you doing?

13
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,645
I have a list.

14
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,713
A list of people
you mean to kill?

15
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,014
For laughing at me?

16
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,150
Do I look like
Joffrey to you?

17
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,118
No, death seems
a bit extreme.

18
00:03:50,152 --> 00:03:52,219
Fear of death,
on the other hand...

19
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:53,821
You should learn
to ignore them.

20
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,990
My lady, people have
been laughing at me

21
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:57,825
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

22
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,793
I'm the Halfman,

23
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:01,862
the Demon Monkey,
the Imp.

24
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:03,430
You're a Lannister.

25
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:07,000
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

26
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,768
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

27
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:12,136
We're perfect for each other.

28
00:04:15,106 --> 00:04:17,308
So how should
we punish them?

29
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,943
Who? Whom?

30
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:22,012
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

31
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,680
Ah.

32
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:27,150
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

33
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,653
Anyone named Desmond
Crakehall must be a pervert.

34
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,122
I hear that
you're a pervert.

35
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,423
I am the Imp.

36
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,191
I have certain standards
to maintain.

37
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,696
We could sheep shift
Lord Desmond's bed.

38
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,532
You cut a little hole
in his mattress

39
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:46,400
and you stuff
sheep dung inside.

40
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:49,302
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

41
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:52,238
His room will stink, but he won't
know where it's coming from.

42
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:53,773
Lady Sansa!

43
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:56,242
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

44
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:58,777
And she was always
angry with me.

45
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:00,879
Why sheep <i>shift?</i>

46
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:04,315
That's the vulgar word
for dung.

47
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,284
My lady...

48
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:07,619
Well, you asked me.

49
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:09,020
Oh!

50
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,622
That's him!

51
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:13,757
My lord, my lady.

52
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:16,093
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

53
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,503
Killed a few
puppies today?

54
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:28,471
Show him.

55
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,473
Come on, show him.

56
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:37,746
Oh, apologies, my lord.

57
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,715
Old fingers.

58
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:50,892
"Roslin caught
a fine fat trout.

59
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:54,929
<i>Her brothers gave her</i>
<i>a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.</i>

60
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:57,765
<i>Signed Walder Frey."</i>

61
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,501
Is that bad poetry

62
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,636
or is it supposed
to mean something?

63
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:05,471
Robb Stark is dead.

64
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:08,807
<i>And his bitch mother.</i>

65
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,676
Write back to Lord Frey.

66
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,379
<i>Thank him for his service</i>
<i>and command him</i>

67
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:17,115
to send Robb Stark's head.

68
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:20,351
I'm going to serve it to Sansa
at my wedding feast.

69
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:23,920
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

70
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:26,489
A joke.
Joffrey did not mean it.

71
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,124
Yes, I did.

72
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:30,993
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

73
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:32,561
<i>No.</i>

74
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:35,130
She is no longer
yours to torment.

75
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:38,933
Everyone is mine
to torment.

76
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:43,203
You'd do well to remember that,
you little monster.

77
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:45,071
Oh, I'm a monster.

78
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:48,640
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

79
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,976
<i>Monsters are dangerous</i>

80
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,012
and just now kings
are dying like flies.

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,554
I could have
your tongue out

82
00:07:04,588 --> 00:07:06,088
<i>for saying that.</i>

83
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:09,024
Let him make his threats.

84
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:12,127
Hmm? He's a bitter
little man.

85
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:15,263
Lord Tyrion should
apologize immediately.

86
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:18,332
Unacceptable,
disrespectful,

87
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,500
<i>and in very bad taste.</i>

88
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:23,336
I am the king!

89
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,904
I will punish you.

90
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:27,439
Any man who must say,
"I am the king"

91
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:30,108
is no true king.

92
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,043
I'll make sure
you understand that

93
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,611
when I've won
your war for you.

94
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:36,314
My father won
the real war.

95
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:39,417
He killed Prince Rhaegar.
He took the crown

96
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:42,220
while you hid
under Casterly Rock!

97
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,833
The king is tired.

98
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,035
See him to his chambers.

99
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:01,304
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

100
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:04,040
We have so much
to celebrate.

101
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:07,142
A wedding to plan.
You must rest.

102
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:12,014
Grand Maester, perhaps
some essence of nightshade

103
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:14,516
to help him sleep.

104
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,951
I'm not tired!

105
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,387
Come.

106
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:43,638
Not you.

107
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:53,212
You just sent the most
powerful man in Westeros

108
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,581
to bed without his supper.

109
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:59,284
You're a fool if you believe he's
the most powerful man in Westeros.

110
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:02,219
A treasonous statement.
Joffrey is king.

111
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,189
You really think a crown
gives you power?

112
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,792
No.

113
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:11,627
I think armies
give you power.

114
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:14,463
- Mm-hmm.
- Robb Stark had one,

115
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:16,431
never lost a battle,

116
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,700
and you defeated him
all the same.

117
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:21,902
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know.

118
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,871
Walder Frey
gets all the credit.

119
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:26,806
Or the blame,
I suppose,

120
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,707
depending on
your allegiance.

121
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:31,977
<i>Walder Frey</i>
<i>is many things,</i>

122
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:34,111
but a brave man?

123
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:35,513
No.

124
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:38,882
He never would have
risked such an action

125
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:41,418
if he didn't have
certain assurances.

126
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:44,187
Which he got from me.

127
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,122
Do you disapprove?

128
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:48,191
<i>I'm all for cheating.</i>
<i>This is war.</i>

129
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:50,393
But to slaughter them
at a wedding...

130
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:53,128
Explain to me
why it is more noble

131
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:55,230
to kill 10,000 men
in battle

132
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:56,565
than a dozen at dinner.

133
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,600
So that's why you did it?

134
00:09:58,635 --> 00:10:00,302
To save lives?

135
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:03,338
To end the war.
To protect the family.

136
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:06,240
<i>Do you want to write a song</i>
<i>for the dead Starks?</i>

137
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:09,109
Go ahead, write one.

138
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:12,679
<i>I'm in this world</i>
<i>a little while longer</i>

139

to defend my blood.

140
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:19,119
The northerners
will never forget.

141
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:20,520
Good.

142
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,222
Let them remember
what happens

143
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:24,591
when they march
on the south.

144
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,329
All the Stark men
are dead.

145
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,198
Winterfell is a ruin.

146
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:36,101
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

147
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:41,105
until your son by Sansa
comes of age.

148
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:47,610
I believe you still have some
work to do on that score.

149
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:52,113
Do you think she'll open
her legs for me

150
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:55,550
after I tell her how we murdered
her mother and brother?

151
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,919
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

152
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:01,455
I will not rape her.

153
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:05,892
Shall I explain to you in one
easy lesson how the world works?

154
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:09,028
Use small words.
I'm not as bright as you.

155
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:12,098
The house that puts family
first will always defeat

156
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:14,533
the house that puts
the whims and wishes

<i>of its sons</i>
<i>and daughters first.</i>

158

A good man does

to better
his family's position

160
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:27,010
regardless of his own
selfish desires.

161
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,180
Does that amuse you?

162
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:35,083
No, it's a very
good lesson.

163
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:38,419
Only it's easy for you to
preach utter devotion to family

164
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:41,054
when you're making
all the decisions.

165
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:42,956
Easy for me, is it?

166
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,259
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest

167
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:48,627
but solely for the benefit
of the family?

168
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:51,496
The day
that you were born.

169
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,835
I wanted to carry you
into the sea

170
00:11:57,869 --> 00:12:00,170
and let the waves
wash you away.

171
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,973
Instead, I let you live.

172
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:08,542
And I brought you up
as my son.

173
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:14,347
Because you're a Lannister.

174
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,664
Sansa.

175
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:02,291
It's empty.

176
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,959
Let's find
a place to sleep.

177
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,669
Hodor.

178
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:18,572
Hodor.

179
00:13:18,606 --> 00:13:21,308
Don't, Hodor.

180
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,513
Maybe we shouldn't
stay here.

181
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:30,182
You'd rather
be out there?

182
00:13:30,216 --> 00:13:33,151
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

183
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,886
Horrible stories.

184
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:38,055
I always quite liked
the horrible stories.

185
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,357
So did I.

186
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,225
Once.

187
00:13:44,528 --> 00:13:46,496
You ever heard
about the Rat Cook?

188
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,764
No.
Who's he?

189
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,967
Just a cook
in the Night's Watch.

190
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,436
He was angry at the king
for something,

191
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,371
I don't remember.

192
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:59,173
When the king was visiting
the Nightfort,

193
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:01,708
the cook killed
the king's son,

194
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:03,643
cooked him
into a big pie

195
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,180
with onions, carrots,
mushrooms and bacon.

196
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:11,183
That night he served
the pie to the king.

197
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,919
He liked the taste
of his son so much,

198
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,354
he asked for
a second slice.

199
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,558
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

200
00:14:21,593 --> 00:14:23,993
<i>who could only eat</i>
<i>his own young.</i>

201
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:27,296
<i>He's been roaming</i>
<i>the Nightfort ever since,</i>

202
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:29,632
<i>devouring his own babies.</i>

203
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:33,802
But no matter
what he does,

204
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,804
he's always hungry.

205
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:39,107
If the gods turned
every killer

206
00:14:39,141 --> 00:14:40,475
into a giant white rat--

207
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,776
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the Rat Cook

208
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:45,145
<i>or for serving</i>
<i>the king's son in a pie.</i>

209
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,514
He killed a guest
beneath his roof.

210
00:14:49,617 --> 00:14:51,951
That's something
the gods can't forgive.

211
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:03,294
"The late Walder Frey,"
old Tully called me

212
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,997
because I didn't get my men to
the Trident in time for battle.

213
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:09,333
<i>He thought he was witty.</i>

214
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,568
<i>Look at us now, Tully.</i>

215
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,605
<i>You're dead,</i>
<i>your daughter's dead,</i>

216
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,206
your grandson's dead,

217
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:19,409
your son spent his wedding
night in a dungeon

218
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:22,245
and I'm Lord
of Riverrun.

219
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:25,949
The Blackfish escaped.

220
00:15:27,484 --> 00:15:29,652
An old man on the run

221
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:32,122
<i>with no allies.</i>

222
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,157
I have Tywin Lannister
backing me.

223
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:37,193
- Who does he have?
- As you say.

224
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,861
<i>They all laughed at me,</i>

225
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,829
all those high lords.

226
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:43,898
They all thought
they were better than me.

227
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,667
Ned Stark,
Hoster Tully.

228
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:50,237
People snigger
when I marry a young girl,

229
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:53,640
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

230
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,709
You'll be needing
a new young girl.

231
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,844
Yeah.

232
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:00,546
Got that
to look forward to.

233
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:03,382
<i>And you,</i>

234
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,584
the Warden
of the North.

235
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:08,920
<i>No more Starks</i>
<i>to bow and scrape to.</i>

236
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:10,622
Must have been torture

237
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:12,724
following that stupid boy
all over the country.

238
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:15,927
He ignored my advice
at every turn.

239
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,996
If he'd been a trifle
less arrogant...

240
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,531
Calling himself
the Young Wolf.

241
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,299
How's that for pomposity?

242
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,203
Well, here's to
the Young Wolf!

243
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,972
Forever young.

244
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:38,379
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

245
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:40,914
At some point perhaps.

246
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:43,116
But Winterfell's in ruins.

247
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,951
Yeah.

248
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:47,786
What happened up there?

249
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,855
I heard the Greyjoy boy
seized the place.

250
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,424
I heard he killed
all the ravens.

251
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,926
And after that, nothing.

252
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:58,929
I sent my bastard Ramsay
to root him out.

253
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,466
Robb Stark offered
amnesty for the ironborn

254
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,334
if they gave us Theon.

255
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,336
Oh. And?

256
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,937
<i>Ramsay delivered</i>
<i>the terms.</i>

257
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:12,107
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

258
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:15,310
<i>They handed him over</i>
<i>trussed and hooded.</i>

259
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:19,413
<i>But Ramsay-- well...</i>

260
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:22,049
<i>Ramsay has his own way</i>
<i>of doing things.</i>

261
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,985
Well, the girls
weren't lying.

262
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,920
You had
a good-sized cock.

263
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:37,061
What?

264
00:17:37,096 --> 00:17:38,496
No.

265
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,234
Pork sausage.

266
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,602
You think I'm some
sort of savage?

267
00:17:57,013 --> 00:18:00,648
People talk about
phantom limbs.

268
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:04,017
<i>An amputee might have an itch</i>
<i>where his foot used to be.</i>

269
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,386
<i>So I've always wondered...</i>

270
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:12,859
do eunuchs
have a phantom cock?

271
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,896
<i>Next time you think</i>
<i>about naked girls,</i>

272
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,465
would you feel an itch?

273
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,407
Sorry.

274
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,343
I shouldn't make jokes.

275
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,914
My mother taught me not
to throw stones at cripples.

276
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:44,020
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

277
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:46,122
Kill me.

278
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:48,057
Sorry, what?

279
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:51,193
Kill me.

280
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:54,462
A little louder.

281
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:57,532
Kill me!

282
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:01,468
You're no good
to me dead.

283
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,937
We need you.

284
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:27,392
You don't look like
a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

285
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,960
That's a name
for a lord.

286
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:34,230
But you're not a lord,

287
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,498
are you?

288
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:39,401
You're just meat.

289
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:44,838
Stinking meat.

290
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:50,343
You reek.

291
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:53,146
Reek!

292
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,381
That's a good name
for you.

293
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:59,185
What's your name?

294
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,454
Theon Greyjoy.

295
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:08,627
What's your name?

296
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,497
Th--

297
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,999
Theon Greyjoy.

298
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:23,240
Please.

299
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:28,278
What is your name?!

300
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,280
Reek.

301
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,151
My name is...

302
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,087
Reek.

303
00:21:06,077 --> 00:21:09,413
Hodor.

304
00:21:40,376 --> 00:21:41,977
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

305
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:44,713
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?!

306
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:47,649
Gilly.
Don't hurt us.

307
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,450
Where are you going?

308
00:21:49,485 --> 00:21:53,020
To Castle Black. I'm a brother
of the Night's Watch.

309
00:21:53,054 --> 00:21:55,355
- My brother, he's in the Night's--
- Shush.

310
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:57,123
- Who's your brother?
- Doesn't matter.

311
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:08,499
You're Jon's brother.

312
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,467
<i>The one who fell</i>
<i>from the window.</i>

313
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:12,635
No, I'm not.

314
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:17,206
I've been around Ghost enough to
know a direwolf when I see one.

315
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,374
And I've heard
all about Hodor.

316
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:21,276
Hodor.

317
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,381
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for Jon.

318
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,449
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

319
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:30,818
And anything I can do
to help you, I will.

320
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:33,221
Take us north
of the Wall.

321
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:39,861
What?

322
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:41,829
Why in the world
would you want to go--

323
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:44,198
I don't want to.
I have to.

324
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:46,000
How did you get
through the Wall?

325
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:48,936
Does the well lead to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?

326
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,405
Come with us.

327
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,309
There are steps carved into
the south side of the Wall.

328
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:56,910
Hodor can carry you
to the top.

329
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:59,011
We'll walk straight
to Castle Black.

330
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:02,481
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

331
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,883
<i>If Jon is alive,</i>

332
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:06,585
<i>then Castle Black's</i>
<i>where he'll be.</i>

333
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,553
It's the safest place
for you.

334
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,221
There's nowhere safe any longer.
You know that.

335
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,791
What I know
is what I saw.

336
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,826
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

337
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,296
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

338
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:22,764
How do you know
all that?

339
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,332
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

340
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:28,969
The kings of Westeros and all
their armies can't stop them.

341
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:40,179
But you're going
to stop them?

342
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:42,848
Please, Sam.

343
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:44,917
<i>I have to go north.</i>

344
00:23:46,485 --> 00:23:48,353
I have to.

345
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:19,544
"Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands

346
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:21,846
and invader of the North.

347
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,847
I give you
until the full moon

348
00:24:23,882 --> 00:24:27,150
to order all ironborn scum
out of the North

349
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:30,220
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks</i>

350
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:32,422
<i>you call a home.</i>

351
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:35,324
<i>On the first night</i>
<i>of the full moon,</i>

352
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,827
<i>I will hunt down</i>
<i>every islander</i>

353
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:42,397
still in our lands
and flay them living

354
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:45,900
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

355
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:47,735
I found at Winterfell.

356
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:51,372
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

357
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,509
Theon's favorite toy.

358
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:58,878
He cried when I took it
away from him.

359
00:25:18,996 --> 00:25:23,233
Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow

360
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:25,835
with more Theon.

361
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,170
Signed Ramsay Snow,

362
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:29,837
natural-born son
of Roose Bolton,

363
00:25:29,872 --> 00:25:32,840
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

364
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:38,045
Get that
out of my sight.

365
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,319
Theon disobeyed
my orders.

366
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:53,192
The boy is a fool.

367
00:25:55,695 --> 00:25:58,864
He cannot further
the Greyjoy line.

368
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:03,568
I will not give up
the lands I have seized,

369
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,770
the strongholds
I have taken.

370
00:26:05,805 --> 00:26:07,572
Get this away from me.

371
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,008
He's your son.

372
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:12,877
Son?

373
00:26:12,911 --> 00:26:15,679
He's not
a man anymore.

374
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:17,281
He's your son.

375
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:20,784
He's my brother.

376
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,051
He's a Greyjoy.

377
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:24,320
Watch yourself.

378
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,688
I've made
my decision.

379
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:33,760
And I've made mine.

380
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:39,932
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

381
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:45,536
<i>I'm going to choose</i>
<i>the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.</i>

382
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,172
Get those ropes!

383
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,073
<i>I'm going to sail</i>
<i>up the Narrow Sea</i>

384
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,441
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the Weeping Water.</i>

385
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:56,779
<i>I'm going to march</i>
<i>on the Dreadfort.</i>

386
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:59,547
<i>I'm going to find</i>
<i>my little brother</i>

387
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,484
<i>and I'm going</i>
<i>to bring him home.</i>

388
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:09,757
What is it?

389
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,325
Dragonglass.

390
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,227
We found them
at the Fist.

391
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:16,763
Someone buried them
a long time ago.

392
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:18,932
Someone wanted us
to find them.

393
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:22,802
Why?
What are they for?

394
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,008
Killing white walkers.

395
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:30,476
How do you know that?

396
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,145
<i>The walker came</i>
<i>for my baby.</i>

397
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:35,547
And Sam...

398
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:38,783
But no one's killed a white
walker in thousands of years.

399
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:42,786
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

400
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,988
Take it, Hodor.

401
00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:53,562
And the archer.

402
00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:01,637
I got lucky

403
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:03,906
with one of them.

404
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,574
There are more.

405
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:09,177
<i>Many more.</i>

406
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:11,712
And for every one of them,

407
00:28:11,747 --> 00:28:14,248
the dead men,

408
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:16,183
more than you
could count.

409
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:21,888
I wish you'd come
with us.

410
00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:24,390
I wish I could.

411
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,094
I really do.

412
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:18,270
How are you keeping?

413
00:29:18,304 --> 00:29:20,104
Great.

414
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:21,605
Never better.

415
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,208
It was just
a bit of blood.

416
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:27,044
I should have known.

417
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:29,646
Every time a highborn
asks my name, it's trouble.

418
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,481
We're not really people
to you, are we?

419
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:34,317
Just a million different ways
to get what you want.

420
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:37,018
- I'm not a highborn.
- She called you Ser.

421
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:38,921
I heard it.

422
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,457
A recent state
of affairs.

423
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:50,463
I was born in Flea Bottom
just like you.

424
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,665
Sure, you were.

425
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:54,499
You're my friend.
You're here to help.

426
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:56,467
I lived below
the Street of Flour.

427
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:57,902
<i>How far below?</i>

428
00:29:57,936 --> 00:30:00,103
How close to the
Red Keep were you?

429
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:03,973
The shit that poured
from their privy pipes

430
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:07,743
<i>flowed down the side</i>
<i>of Aegon's Hill</i>

431
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:11,812
along Tanner's Row and right
in front of my front door

432
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,981
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

433
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:18,617
The Street of Steel,

434
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:21,954
with your armor and your knights?
Pfft.

435
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:24,422
You lived in the fancy
part of town.

436
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,262
And here we are now.

437
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,866
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

438
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,368
Yeah, we've come
a long way.

439
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,704
We're all
the same, really.

440
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,674
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

441
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,010
If you mistrust
fancy people so much,

442
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,180
why were you in such a
hurry to trust her?

443
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,950
You're me.

444
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,418
Never been with a woman.

445
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,188
<i>Never talked</i>
<i>to a woman, really.</i>

446
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,789
<i>And then she</i>
<i>comes at you--</i>

447
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,925
big words, no clothes.

448
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,727
What would you have done?

449
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:09,031
She does know her way around a
man's head, I'll give her that.

450
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,439
So how'd you
become a lord?

451
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:19,073
Oh, that's a long story.

452
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:22,209
Better not, then.
I'm a bit busy.

453
00:31:25,547 --> 00:31:27,381
Many years ago
I helped King Stannis

454
00:31:27,415 --> 00:31:29,917
out of a difficult
situation.

455
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:33,253
He rewarded me
with a lordship.

456
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:35,556
And this.

457
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:39,659
You see?

458
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:41,861
Highborns.

459
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,934
I didn't want
to be a lord.

460
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,769
I nearly didn't accept.

461
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:51,237
Why did you?

462
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:54,240
I did it for my son.

463
00:31:54,274 --> 00:31:56,708
I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit

464
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:59,243
every time he stepped
through his front door.

465
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,980
I wanted him to have
a better life.

466
00:32:04,983 --> 00:32:06,550
Does he?

467
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:09,520
He's dead.

468
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,559
How'd he die?

469
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:19,928
Following me.

470
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,205
When did you come
to this strange country?

471
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:37,442
When I was 13.

472
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:39,410
You were only a child.

473
00:32:40,578 --> 00:32:43,013
I stopped being a child
when I was nine.

474
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,782
My mother
made sure of that.

475
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,319
You've been
a good influence

476
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:51,654
on our mutual friend,
you know.

477
00:32:51,689 --> 00:32:53,723
He used to drink
from sundown to sunup,

478
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:55,357
visit three brothels
a night,

479
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,926
gamble away
his father's money.

480
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:59,928
Now it's just
the drinking.

481
00:32:59,962 --> 00:33:03,298
And now
I'm his wife's servant.

482
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:05,266
I brush her hair
and clip her nails

483
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,767
and empty
her chamber pot.

484
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:08,269
She is a sweet
young thing.

485
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:09,770
None of this
is her fault.

486
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:12,739
I love that girl.
I would kill for her.

487
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,707
Do you think that
makes it easier for me?

488
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,810
No, I expect not.

489
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:23,616
She's young and she's
beautiful and highborn.

490
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,417
We break bread
with them,

491
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:28,053
but that doesn't
make us family.

492
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:29,522
We've learned
their language,

493
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:32,091
but we'll never be
their countrymen.

494
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,828
If you let yourself believe

495
00:33:36,863 --> 00:33:39,064
that a foreign girl
with no name

496
00:33:39,098 --> 00:33:41,432
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister--

497
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:44,235
- I have a name.
- You have one name.

498
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:45,803
As do I.

499
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:48,839
Here only the family
name matters.

500
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:51,108
What do you want
from me, Lord Varys?

501
00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:56,514
Diamonds.

502
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:59,483
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

503
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:01,885
but you know how
to protect yourself.

504
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:04,554
Get on one
of those ships.

505
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,357
Sail to Pentos
or Lys or Myr.

506
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:10,527
You can buy a house
with these diamonds,

507
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:12,529
a very large house.

508
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:14,397
Hire servants.

509
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:15,832
Start a new life,

510
00:34:15,866 --> 00:34:18,368
a good life,
far from here.

511
00:34:18,402 --> 00:34:21,470
The mysterious
foreign beauty.

512
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:23,506
You'll have suitors
lining up.

513
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,807
Why do you
want me to leave?

514
00:34:25,842 --> 00:34:28,443
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

515
00:34:28,477 --> 00:34:30,545
who could make this country
a better place.

516
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:32,280
He has the mind for it,
he has the will,

517
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:33,747
he has the right
last name.

518
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:35,882
And you--

519
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:39,052
you are a complication.

520
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,487
I know you love him.

521
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:46,457
And I know it's true love not
bought by gold and silver.

522
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:49,026
I'm not asking you
to leave him for money.

523
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,628
I'm asking you to leave

524
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:54,664
because your presence
in the capital

525
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:57,066
endangers him.

526
00:34:58,235 --> 00:35:00,702
This will never
be your home, my lady.

527
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:04,572
Find a true home
somewhere far from here...

528
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:08,108
while there's still time.

529
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:11,912
Lord Varys.

530
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:18,884
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

531
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,891
Keep up.

532
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:31,593
I don't think
I can, my lord.

533
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:36,096
It's not easy
being drunk all the time.

534
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:40,567
Everyone would do it
if it were easy.

535
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,037
Leave.

536
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,681
So, enjoying
married life?

537
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:05,187
An unhappy wife is a wine
merchant's best friend.

538
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,588
She doesn't
deserve this.

539
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,123
Deserve?

540
00:36:09,157 --> 00:36:12,059
Be careful with that.

541
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:15,295
Start trying to work out
who deserves what

542
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:17,730
and before long you'll spend
the rest of your days

543
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:21,000
weeping for each and every
person in the world.

544
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:24,636
There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming philosopher.

545
00:36:26,005 --> 00:36:28,306
Will you be facing
your marriage to Ser Loras

546
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,475
with the same
philosophical spirit?

547
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,077
I won't be marrying
Ser Loras.

548
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:35,946
I seem to remember
saying something similar

549
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,947
about my own marriage.

550
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,250
You're not me.

551
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:43,385
You want to make things
better for Sansa?

552
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,154
Give her a child.

553
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:47,155
So you can tell Father
it was you

554
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,390
who finally
talked me into it?

555
00:36:49,425 --> 00:36:52,526
So she can have
some happiness in her life.

556
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:54,262
You have children.

557
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:57,398
How happy would
you say you are?

558
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:02,002
Not very.

559
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,907
But if it weren't
for my children,

560
00:37:06,942 --> 00:37:09,810
I'd have thrown myself from the
highest window in the Red Keep.

561
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,214
They're the reason
I'm alive.

562
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,316
Even Joffrey?

563
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,218
Even Joffrey.

564
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:25,322
He was all I had once.

565
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:27,991
Before Myrcella was born.

566
00:37:31,495 --> 00:37:34,097
I used to spend hours

567
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:36,565
looking at him.

568
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,700
His wisps of hair.

569
00:37:39,802 --> 00:37:42,469
His tiny little
hands and feet.

570
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:46,040
He was such
a jolly little fellow.

571
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:52,278
You always hear the terrible
ones were terrible babies.

572
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,080
"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."

573
00:37:55,114 --> 00:37:57,214
It's nonsense.

574
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,552
Whenever he was with me,
he was happy.

575
00:38:05,523 --> 00:38:07,224
And no one can take that
away from me,

576
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,025
not even Joffrey--

577
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,660
how it feels
to have someone.

578
00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:15,163
Someone of your own.

579
00:38:24,938 --> 00:38:27,506
How long
does it go on?

580
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:32,578
Until we've dealt
with all our enemies.

581
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,881
Every time we deal
with an enemy,

582
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,983
we create two more.

583
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:43,887
Then I suppose it will go
on for quite a long time.

584
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:51,259
I'm telling you,
that's what she did.

585
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:56,562
<i>Sounded like</i>
<i>a cow in heat.</i>

586
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:59,031
- Aye, not for long.
- That's right.

587
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:01,233
Black Walder
shut her up right quick.

588
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:04,469
<i>None of the Starks had much to
say about the end of that meal.</i>

589
00:39:04,503 --> 00:39:06,037
I'll tell you what,
though.

590
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:09,373
The hardest thing was getting that
wolf's head to stay on the body.

591
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,909
- You sewed it on?
- I did.

592
00:39:11,943 --> 00:39:15,045
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

593
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,813
It was me.

594
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:19,783
And Malcolm
and Talbott.

595
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:22,552
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

596
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:24,153
Took the skin
right with it.

597
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:27,156
<i>What we ended up having to do</i>
<i>was hook the needle</i>

598
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:28,758
<i>right under</i>
<i>the collarbone.</i>

599
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,594
Give it a nice
firm mooring and--

600
00:39:34,797 --> 00:39:36,197
What do you want?

601
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:39,500
- Mind if I keep warm?
- Fuck off.

602
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:41,868
But I'm hungry.

603
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:45,304
Does fuck off mean something
different where you're from?

604
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,472
I've got money.

605
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:53,543
What kind of coin
is that?

606
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:55,412
It's worth a lot.

607
00:39:58,049 --> 00:39:59,349
Sorry.

608
00:39:59,384 --> 00:40:01,384
Little shit.

609
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,824
<i>Fool!</i>

610
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:25,274
Where did you
get the knife?

611
00:40:25,308 --> 00:40:27,009
From you.

612
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:33,014
<i>Is that the first man</i>
<i>you've killed?</i>

613
00:40:33,048 --> 00:40:35,149
The first man.

614
00:40:36,417 --> 00:40:38,785
Next time you're going
to do something like that,

615
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,953
tell me first.

616
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,997
Valar morghulis.

617
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:26,826
Ygritte, you know
I didn't have a choice.

618
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,831
You always knew who I was,

619
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,699
what I am.

620
00:41:37,236 --> 00:41:39,904
I have to go home now.

621
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:44,407
I know you won't hurt me.

622
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:48,011
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

623
00:41:51,648 --> 00:41:54,116
I do know some things.

624
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:56,953
I know I love you.

625
00:41:59,622 --> 00:42:01,956
<i>I know you love me.</i>

626
00:42:04,593 --> 00:42:07,429
But I have
to go home now.

627
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,536
I know how
this must look.

628
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:56,375
- What I meant was--
- I swear to you, my lord--

629
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,844
I'm not a lord, my dear.

630
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:01,580
Not for many, many years.

631
00:43:01,614 --> 00:43:04,950
<i>Every man who joins</i>
<i>the Night's Watch</i>

632
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:09,053
renounces
all former titles.

633
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:12,956
Among other things.

634
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,761
What is your name?

635
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,462
Gilly.

636
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:22,799
Ah, for the gillyflower.

637
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,333
Lovely.

638
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,701
Yes, my--

639
00:43:28,771 --> 00:43:30,405
Maester.

640
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,641
Master.

641
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:35,143
Maester.

642
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:37,145
And the child?

643
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:40,782
She hasn't chosen
a name yet.

644
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:43,117
His name is Sam.

645
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:48,823
Tarly...

646
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:52,259
do you remember
the oath you swore

647
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:54,861
when you joined
this order?

648
00:43:54,896 --> 00:43:58,031
He's not my child,
Maester Aemon.

649
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:01,267
She's one
of Craster's wives.

650
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:09,641
I remember every word
of the oath.

651
00:44:10,743 --> 00:44:13,378
Night gathers
and my watch begins.

652
00:44:13,413 --> 00:44:17,248
<i>I am the shield that guards</i>
<i>the realms of men.</i>

653
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:21,919
The realms of men.

654
00:44:23,855 --> 00:44:26,657
That means her
as well as us.

655
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:30,060
We didn't build
500 miles of ice walls

656
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:32,729
700 feet high
to keep out men.

657
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:37,067
The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon.

658
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:39,169
I've seen it.

659
00:44:39,203 --> 00:44:41,704
It's coming
for all of us.

660
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:47,576
Gilly, you and your son

661
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:50,579
will be our guests
for the time being.

662
00:44:50,613 --> 00:44:55,516
We certainly cannot
send you back

663
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,517
beyond the Wall.

664
00:44:57,552 --> 00:45:00,053
Thank you...

665
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:02,455
Maester.

666
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:04,557
I can cook and clean
and I can--

667
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:06,258
Good.

668
00:45:06,293 --> 00:45:10,828
Samwell, fetch a quill
and inkwell.

669
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:18,535
I hope your penmanship is
better than your swordplay.

670
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:20,670
Miles better.

671
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:26,241
We had 44 ravens
at last count.

672
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:29,744
Make sure
they're all fed.

673
00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:33,047
Every one of them
flies tonight.

674
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:44,523
"To His Grace

675
00:45:44,558 --> 00:45:47,226
King Stannis Baratheon.

676
00:45:48,294 --> 00:45:51,663
Invaded-- inv--
invit-- invited

677
00:45:51,697 --> 00:45:55,466
to the name day
celebration

678
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,804
for Rylene Florent

679
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:03,072
on the first nigit--"

680
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:05,074
Night.

681
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:07,376
"First night
of the full moon."

682
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,844
Why is there
a G in night?

683
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:10,912
I don't know.
There just is.

684
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,182
Well, your father's
not going to go to that.

685
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:18,118
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

686
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:20,153
You could read about
Balerion the Dread.

687
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:23,689
They say you can still see his skull
in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.

688
00:46:23,724 --> 00:46:26,024
I'd like to see
that someday.

689
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:29,427
I've been trying to stay out of
those dungeons my whole life.

690
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:33,030
"His fangs were as long
as bastard swords."

691
00:46:34,366 --> 00:46:36,400
Aye, old Balerion's
definitely better

692
00:46:36,434 --> 00:46:39,569
than anything your cousin
Rylene's got on offer.

693
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:41,971
But now that I'm your
father's Hand again,

694
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:44,272
I have to keep
him informed.

695
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:47,841
The king does not have
time for this drudgery.

696
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:53,846
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros."

697
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,715
- Noblemen.
- <i>"Noblemen of Westeros,</i>

698
00:46:56,749 --> 00:47:01,186
the Nig--
the Night's Watch...

699
00:47:04,256 --> 00:47:06,324
implores..."

700
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:07,992
What is it?

701
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,297
Why are they
ringing the bells?

702
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,199
<i>Are we being attacked?</i>

703
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,667
Stay here.

704
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,802
Bar the door.

705
00:47:39,218 --> 00:47:41,586
The usurper
Robb Stark is dead.

706
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,055
Betrayed by his bannerman.

707
00:47:45,089 --> 00:47:48,892
And you take credit because you
dropped a leech into the fire?

708
00:47:48,926 --> 00:47:50,493
I take no credit.

709
00:47:50,528 --> 00:47:53,563
<i>I have faith and my faith</i>
<i>has been rewarded.</i>

710
00:47:56,766 --> 00:48:01,069
Your Grace, the world
has got so far bent.

711
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:03,971
I've seen things
crawl out of nightmares,

712
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:05,705
but my eyes were open.

713
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,574
I don't know if Robb Stark died
because of the Red Woman's sorcery

714
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:10,809
or because at war
men die all the time,

715
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:14,011
but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

716
00:48:14,046 --> 00:48:15,713
with blood magic is wrong.

717
00:48:15,747 --> 00:48:16,914
It is evil.

718
00:48:16,948 --> 00:48:19,116
And you are not
an evil man.

719
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,852
Do you know who had this table
carved and painted, Ser Davos?

720
00:48:22,787 --> 00:48:24,154
Aegon Targaryen.

721
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:26,823
And do you know how Aegon
Targaryen conquered Westeros?

722
00:48:26,857 --> 00:48:28,891
On the back of his dragon
Balerion the Dread.

723
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:32,760
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

724
00:48:32,794 --> 00:48:35,496
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

725
00:48:35,563 --> 00:48:37,631
Dragons are magic,
Ser Davos.

726
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:41,101
My enemies have made
my kingdom bleed.

727
00:48:43,037 --> 00:48:45,071
<i>I will not forget that.</i>

728
00:48:45,106 --> 00:48:47,741
I will not forgive that.

729
00:48:49,277 --> 00:48:52,078
I will punish them
with any arms

730
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:53,413
at my disposal.

731
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:56,316
You do not need
to burn the boy.

732
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,585
<i>If what you say is true,</i>

733
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,689
a drop of his blood
killed Robb Stark--

734
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:05,491
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

735
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:11,597
A great gift requires
a great sacrifice.

736
00:49:28,246 --> 00:49:30,614
His name is Gendry.

737
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,282
He's a good lad.

738
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:35,485
A poor lad
from Flea Bottom

739
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,187
who happens
to be your nephew.

740
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:46,995
What is the life of one bastard
boy against a kingdom?

741
00:49:48,764 --> 00:49:50,531
Everything.

742
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,667
The boy must die.

743
00:50:01,007 --> 00:50:02,974
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

744
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:05,843
Is this some kind
of trick?

745
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:08,545
Yes, but not on you.

746
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:15,417
Aim for that star.
Don't stop.

747
00:50:15,451 --> 00:50:17,686
There's bread and water.
Go slow with it.

748
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,454
If you finish it off,

749
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:22,757
no matter how
thirsty you get,

750
00:50:22,791 --> 00:50:24,725
don't drink seawater.

751
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:26,760
I know not
to drink seawater.

752
00:50:26,794 --> 00:50:30,464
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

753
00:50:30,498 --> 00:50:33,233
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

754
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:34,601
Where should I go?

755
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:36,036
You must keep the coast
on your left side

756
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,603
until you reach
King's Landing.

757
00:50:37,638 --> 00:50:39,505
The gold cloaks
are looking for me.

758
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,240
They were looking
for me for 20 years.

759
00:50:41,274 --> 00:50:43,241
- Do they know your face?
- No.

760
00:50:43,276 --> 00:50:45,010
I'd worry more
about the Red Woman.

761
00:50:52,051 --> 00:50:53,684
The other way.

762
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,056
You ever been
in a boat before?

763
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,691
No.

764
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,992
You know how to swim?

765
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,226
No.

766
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,694
Don't fall out.

767
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:08,230
Go on.

768
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:11,566
Why are you doing this?

769
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,068
<i>Because it's right.</i>

770
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:15,970
And because
I'm a slow learner.

771
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,176
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

772
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:28,682
<i>Horse approaching!</i>

773
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:31,885
Halt! Halt!

774
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:51,502
Jon! Jon!

775
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:53,203
<i>Jon, it's us.</i>

776
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:55,539
I don't think
he can see us.

777
00:51:59,343 --> 00:52:02,545
Pyp?

778
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,814
Sam?

779
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:08,184
Hush, now.
You're home.

780
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:12,888
Carry him inside.
Gently.

781
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:40,545
Out of the way.

782
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,214
Step aside,
country boy.

783
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:44,116
People working here.

784
00:53:29,185 --> 00:53:31,319
Cersei.

785
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:52,003
You don't deny it?

786
00:53:52,037 --> 00:53:54,038
No.

787
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,174
I let him go.

788
00:53:57,209 --> 00:54:00,277
Your mercy
saved the boy's life.

789
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:02,112
You feel good
about that?

790
00:54:02,146 --> 00:54:03,513
Aye, I do.

791
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:06,115
<i>You saved one innocent.</i>

792
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:09,818
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

793
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:15,423
There has got
to be another way.

794
00:54:15,457 --> 00:54:16,891
What other way?!

795
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:18,726
Tell us about
this other way.

796
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,428
I don't know,
Your Grace.

797
00:54:20,462 --> 00:54:23,230
I can't see the future
in the fire.

798
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:29,568
Very well,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

799
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:33,505
I, Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

800
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:35,874
First of My Name, Rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

801
00:54:35,908 --> 00:54:37,809
- sentence you to die.
- I understand.

802
00:54:37,843 --> 00:54:40,111
But since you haven't yet
unnamed me Hand of the King,

803
00:54:40,145 --> 00:54:42,646
it is my duty
to advise you against it.

804
00:54:42,681 --> 00:54:45,282
- You're gonna need me.
- Take him away.

805
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,452
Why am I gonna need you?

806
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,190
My king.

807
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,628
<i>It's from Maester Aemon</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch.</i>

808
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:02,297
<i>Their Lord Commander</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

809
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:04,999
<i>Took a ranging party north</i>
<i>and never made it back.</i>

810
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:07,234
One lad did, though.

811
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:09,903
What he saw
beyond the Wall--

812
00:55:09,937 --> 00:55:12,372
it's coming
for all of us.

813
00:55:26,517 --> 00:55:28,351
When did you
learn to read?

814
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:29,852
Matthos taught me
before he died

815
00:55:29,886 --> 00:55:31,954
so I could be
of better service to you.

816
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:42,964
This War of Five Kings
means nothing.

817
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:47,501
<i>The true war lies</i>
<i>to the north, my king.</i>

818
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:50,937
Death marches on the Wall.

819
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,573
Only you can stop him.

820
00:55:53,608 --> 00:55:55,675
You can't stop him alone.

821
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:58,410
You need someone to rebuild
your army for you,

822
00:55:58,445 --> 00:56:00,979
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

823
00:56:01,014 --> 00:56:03,081
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

824
00:56:03,116 --> 00:56:05,484
I've made my decision.

825
00:56:06,886 --> 00:56:10,088
He's right.
You need him.

826
00:56:10,122 --> 00:56:12,758
He has a part to play
in the war to come.

827
00:56:21,732 --> 00:56:24,199
You see, Ser Davos?

828
00:56:24,234 --> 00:56:27,602
You've been saved
by that fire god you like to mock.

829
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:33,373
You're in his army now.

830
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:58,761
They will come,
Your Grace.

831
00:56:58,795 --> 00:57:00,696
When they're ready.

832
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:02,498
Perhaps they didn't
want to be conquered.

833
00:57:02,532 --> 00:57:05,034
You didn't conquer them.

834
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:07,203
You liberated them.

835
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:10,673
People learn to love
their chains.

836
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:14,429
No.

837
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:54,665
- Mhysa!
- Mhysa!

838
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:57,467
Mhysa! Mhysa!

839
00:58:57,502 --> 00:58:59,802
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

840
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,772
What does it mean?

841
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:05,707
It is old Ghiscari,
khaleesi.

842
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,143
It means "mother."

843
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:16,182
It's all right.

844
00:59:16,216 --> 00:59:17,917
These people
won't hurt me.

845
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:23,089
Mhysa! Mhysa!

846
01:00:11,865 --> 01:00:15,033
Mhysa.

847
01:00:26,544 --> 01:00:29,145
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
