2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,700
King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,720
my son will accompany you both, their engagement must stand.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,580
Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now...

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,000
or you can die.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,720
- You can save him? - The process may change him...

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,720
Fornication, treason, incest,

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,330
the murder of King Robert.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,200
There is a way out.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,750
Confess, to the High Sparrow.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,150
What do we say to the god of death?

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,640
Not today.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,620
You don't want to hurt anymore?

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,830
Is a girl ready?

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,510
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue,

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,350
her loves and hates? All that makes a girl who she is?

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,610
Is a girl ready to become no one, Forever?

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,050
- Uncle Benjen. - I'm leaving this morning.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,650
I'm the first ranger. My job is out there.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,940
That's my uncle Benjen's horse.

21
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,330
Where's my uncle?

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,880
If you're ever in trouble,

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,220
light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,000
Unless there's a thaw, we can't march forward...

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,790
This isn't our time.

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,870
This is the right time and I will risk everything.

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,870
Because if I don't, we've lost.

28
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,830
Ride for Castle Black, tell the Lord Commander

29
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,210
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

30
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,620
I have shown you the power of king's blood.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,550
And your blood runs through her veins.

32
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,630
Forgive me.

33
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,270
- Lord of Light, show us the way.  - Mother!

34
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,660
Please! Please! No!

35
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,330
Brace the wind.

36
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,780
The lord of light has made good on his promise, my king.

37
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,300
His fires have melted the snows away.

38
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,420
The way ahead is clear.

39
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,000
We ride for Winterfell.

40
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,640
And you will take it.

41
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,140
The lord has shown me Bolton Banners burning.

42
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,110
You will receive what is yours by right.

43
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,310
Your grace.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,390
Prepare to form up.

45
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,400
Your grace.

46
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,730
Tell me.

47
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,580
The men, many deserted before dawn.

48
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,190
How many?

49
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,110
Nearly half.

50
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,700
All the sellswords with all the horses.

51
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,610
Your grace.

52
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,410
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

53
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,780
Cut her down.

54
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,500
Your grace.

55
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,300
The lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

56
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,980
Get the men into marching formation.

57
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,320
On to Winterfell.

58
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,820
He raised his hands

59
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,430
and they all stood up at once.

60
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,440
Tens of thousands of them. The biggest army in the world.

61
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,560
So what are you gonna do?

62
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,350
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the Wall.

63
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,810
But the dragonglass...

64
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,990
No one's ever getting that back now.

65
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,220
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.

66
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,750
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

67
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,580
But you killed a white walker.

68
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,030
With Longclaw.

69
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,790
I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass.

70
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,760
- But Longclaw... - is Valyrian steel.

71
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,500
How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

72
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,800
Not enough.

73
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,920
The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice

74
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,730
the lives of sworn brothers to save the lives of wildlings.

75
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,720
How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

76
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,860
You were friends with me when I first came here.

77
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,140
And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

78
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,650
Here's to us, then.

79
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,460
Long may they sneer.

80
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,850
What?

81
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,730
I wanted to ask you something.

82
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,270
To ask something of you.

83
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,500
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown

84
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,160
so I can become a maester.

85
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,290
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

86
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,250
I need you here, Sam.

87
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,950
If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

88
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,630
Well, there's Edd.

89
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,430
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

90
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,570
More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon is gone.

91
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,360
The Citadel has the world's greatest library.

92
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,770
I'll learn about history,

93
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,690
strategy, healing.

94
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,880
And other things,

95
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
things that will help when--

96
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,660
when they come.

97
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,990
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

98
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,330
And the baby that she named after me will die.

99
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,220
And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them.

100
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,310
Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world

101
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,290
will be the look in her eyes when I fail them.

102
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,990
And I'd rather see a thousand white walkers than see that.

103
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,460
Thank you.

104
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,840
You know that the Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

105
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,700
Oh, they'll bloody try.

106
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,210
- Sam. - What?

107
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,770
Sam.

108
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,320
You had just been beaten half to death. How did you--

109
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,140
Oh, very carefully.

110
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,730
I'm glad the end of the world's working out well for someone.

111
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,400
I'll come back.

112
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,760
To your return.

113
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,050
To my return.

114
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,850
Aye, this way.

115
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,850
My lady!

116
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,040
Stannis.

117
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,910
Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

118
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,170
How do you know it's Stannis?

119
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,150
They're carrying his flaming heart banners.

120
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,670
From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

121
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,170
Trench here.

122
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,970
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.

123
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,180
Hurry them along.

124
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Dig between those two rises.

125
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,820
- Spread out. - I'm with you.

126
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,290
- Archers! - Spread out!

127
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,650
And send out a foraging party immediately.

128
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,410
Siege begins at sunrise.

129
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,790
There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

130
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,140
We've got no chance!

131
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,470
No, please, please.

132
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,050
Bolton has women fighting for him?

133
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,410
I don't fight for the Boltons.

134
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

135
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,420
I was kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

136
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,250
I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.

137
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,770
You murdered him with blood magic?

138
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,640
I did.

139
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,060
In the name of Renly of house Baratheon, first of his name,

140
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,490
rightful king of the Andals and the First Men,

141
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,770
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,

142
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,310
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

143
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,040
Do you have any last words?

144
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,060
Go on, do your duty.

145
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,120
Looks like we're done here.

146
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,060
I surrender! I surrender!

147
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,130
And I accept your surrender.

148
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,960
Let's head back.

149
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,080
My wife must be lonely.

150
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,210
My lady.

151
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,580
I've come to escort you back to your chamber.

152
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,260
Go with her, please.

153
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,800
I know what Ramsay is.

154
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,020
I know what he'll do to me.

155
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,090
If I'm going to die,

156
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,990
let it happen while there's still some of me left.

157
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,200
Die?

158
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,220
Who said anything about dying?

159
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,730
You can't die.

160
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,830
Your father was Warden of the North.

161
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,200
Ramsay needs you.

162
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,130
Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.

163
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,620
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

164
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,040
until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them.

165
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,460
Then he's got incredible plans for those parts.

166
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,100
So, shall we wait for him to come back

167
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,700
or should we begin now?

168
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,630
You're leaving it to me?

169
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,580
Good.

170
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,720
Let's begin.

171
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,150
Reek... stop!

172
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,910
Stop!

173
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,030
Open the gate!

174
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,170
He's coming back.

175
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,550
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

176
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,790
You two, out.

177
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,970
You were the first person on my list, you know.

178
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,490
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

179
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,640
Probably not.

180
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,780
I've gotten a few of the others.

181
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,810
The many-faced god stole a few more from me.

182
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,010
But I'm glad he left me you.

183
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,580
Do you know who I am?

184
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,400
I can't hear you.

185
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,410
You know who I am.

186
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,300
I'm Arya Stark.

187
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,570
Do you know who you are?

188
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,120
You're no one.

189
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,500
You're nothing.

190
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,460
A girl has taken a life.

191
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,140
The wrong life.

192
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,730
I was right about her.

193
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,890
You were.

194
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,660
You're not ready.

195
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,250
Not at all.

196
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,970
That man's life was not yours to take.

197
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,940
A girl stole from the many-faced god.

198
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,060
Now a debt is owed.

199
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,540
Only death can pay for life.

200
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,890
No! No!

201
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,330
No, you... don't die! Don't die!

202
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,010
Why are you crying?

203
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,080
He was my friend.

204
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,690
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

205
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,370
He was no one.

206
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,190
But if you're...

207
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,400
Who's this?

208
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,260
No one at all.

209
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,070
Just as a girl should have been

210
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,970
before she took a face from the hall.

211
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,940
The faces are for no one.

212
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,880
You are still someone.

213
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,280
And to someone,

214
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,710
the faces are as good as poison.

215
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,010
I can't see.

216
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,670
What's happening?

217
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,710
What's happening?!

218
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,130
- I wish you a safe journey home. - Thank you.

219
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,670
Forgive me, child.

220
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,300
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

221
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,800
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

222
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,990
Maybe I'll come visit you.

223
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,470
Don't wait too long.

224
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,760
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

225
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,160
You want a good girl,

226
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,230
but you need the bad pussy.

227
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,470
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

228
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,810
Try not to lose it this time.

229
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,680
I'll never take it off again.

230
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,840
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

231
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,760
but I'm glad you're coming home.

232
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,290
Your mother's desperate to see you.

233
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,280
I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.

234
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,830
He seems like a nice boy.

235
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,040
You're lucky.

236
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,510
Arranged marriages are rarely so--

237
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,350
so well arranged.

238
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,100
Do you think mother will like him?

239
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,010
If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

240
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,720
You really believe that?

241
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,270
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone

242
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,970
aside from her children?

243
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,440
She likes you.

244
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,730
I'm not so sure about that.

245
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,550
Listen...

246
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,950
There's something I wanted to tell you.

247
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,630
Something I should have told you long ago.

248
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:44,950
So...

249
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,800
Now that you've seen more of the world,

250
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,270
you've learned how complicated things can be,

251
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,820
people can be.

252
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,710
The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years,

253
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,900
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

254
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,550
It was an accident, really. I mean, what were the chances?

255
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,340
You happen to fall in love with the man

256
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,530
you were assigned to marry?

257
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,270
My point is...

258
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,880
We don't choose whom we love.

259
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,890
It just, well--

260
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,420
It's beyond our control.

261
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,400
- I sound like an idiot. - No, you don't.

262
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,000
What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying

263
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,310
and failing to say--

264
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,650
I know what you're trying to say.

265
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,770
No, I'm afraid you don't.

266
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,700
I do.

267
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,280
I know.

268
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,320
About you and mother.

269
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,000
I think a part of me always knew.

270
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,950
And I'm glad.

271
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,280
I'm glad that you're my father.

272
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,580
Myrcella?

273
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,410
Myrcella?

274
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,130
Myrcella? Myrcella?

275
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,240
You love her, don't you?

276
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,920
How could you not?

277
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,280
Of course it's hopeless for the both of you.

278
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,450
A sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight.

279
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,080
Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen.

280
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,650
But we always want the wrong woman.

281
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,190
Does he always talk so much?

282
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,690
Jorah the Andal.

283
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,600
Torgo Nudho.

284
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,120
He should not be here.

285
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,630
No, but he is.

286
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,180
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

287
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,680
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

295
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,790
Punila. Thank you.

296
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,710
I am sorry.

297
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,470
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

298
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,760
You missed a good scrap.

299
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,990
None of that matters now.

300
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,810
The longer we sit here bantering,

301
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,370
the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

302
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,750
He's right. The dragon headed north.

303
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,690
If we're going to find her, that's where we'll have to go.

304
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,820
We?

305
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,850
You're a Lannister.

306
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,590
The queen intends to remove your family from power.

307
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,430
And I intend to help her do it.

308
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,510
You've been here for how many days now?

309
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,570
I've fought for her for years.

310
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,550
Since she was little more than a child.

311
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,440
- You betrayed her. - Careful now.

312
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,020
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

313
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,550
The second time thanks to you.

314
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,110
Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

315
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,940
He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

316
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,290
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

317
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,900
Perhaps she feels differently about him now.

318
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,080
Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

319
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,950
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

320
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,790
Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

321
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,810
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

322
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,710
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

323
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,640
- Pardon me? - Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

324
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,560
Not precisely, but I have other skills that would be useful.

325
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,780
Can you fight?

326
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,910
I have fought.

327
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,900
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

328
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,520
Are you good on a horse?

329
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,200
Middling.

330
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,890
So mainly you talk.

331
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,940
And drink. I've survived so far.

332
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,180
Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.

333
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,150
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

334
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,140
None of us have experience governing a city

335
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,310
except for him.

336
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,160
You want to prove your value to the queen?

337
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,680
Prove it right here in Meereen.

338
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,360
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.

339
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,900
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

340
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,070
They wouldn't.

341
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,690
They will listen to Grey Worm.

342
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,990
I'll come with you.

343
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,980
I'll find our queen.

344
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,900
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere. - I am.

345
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,610
He is. He's the toughest man with no balls I ever met.

346
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,450
But you still can't go.

347
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,800
The people believe in you.

348
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,810
They know you speak for the queen.

349
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,840
It's true.

350
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,330
Only the unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen.

351
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,100
If you leave,

352
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,450
half this city will consume the other half.

353
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,070
And Missandei.

354
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,510
Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei.

355
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,420
Certainly not me.

356
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,490
The queen's closest confidante,

357
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,160
the commander of the unsullied,

358
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,970
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

359
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,810
Good fortune, my friends.

360
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,070
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

361
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,050
Try not to ruin her.

362
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,450
Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

363
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,130
Let's find some good horses.

364
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,850
We have so much to talk about.

365
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,640
Hello, old friend.

366
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,990
I thought we were so happy together

367
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,290
until you abandoned me.

368
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,940
I suppose there's no point asking how you found me.

369
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,550
The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east,

370
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,350
if one knows how to listen.

371
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,230
They tell me you've already found favor with the mother of dragons.

372
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,310
Well, she didn't execute me,

373
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,530
so that's a promising start.

374
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,000
Now the heroes are off to find her

375
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,880
and I'm stuck here

376
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,420
trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war.

377
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,500
Any advice for an old comrade?

378
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,960
Information is the key.

379
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,830
You need to learn your enemy's strengths and strategies.

380
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,980
You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

381
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,630
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

382
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,140
If only.

383
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,080
A grand old city

384
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,100
choking on violence, corruption, and deceit.

385
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,980
Who could possibly have any experience

386
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,060
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

387
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,690
I did miss you.

388
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,470
Oh, I know.

389
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,050
We have to go home.

390
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,110
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

391
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,760
Does it hurt?

392
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,390
We have to go home.

393
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,230
Drogon.

394
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,160
Can you take me back to Meereen?

395
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,530
How far did you carry me?

396
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,470
Drogon, we need to return.

397
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,350
My people need me.

398
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,050
Well, there's no food.

399
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,020
At the very least, you could hunt us some supper.

400
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,200
Confess.

401
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,580
Confess.

402
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,730
I have sinned.

403
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,820
I see that now.

404
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,780
How can I have been so blind for so long?

405
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,550
I want to be clean again.

406
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,080
I want absolution.

407
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,740
The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high.

408
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,840
And by its holy light--

409
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,670
You wish to make a confession?

410
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,230
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

411
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,200
Your grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

412
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,350
The Mother have mercy, then.

413
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,480
I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage. I confess.

414
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,650
Name him.

415
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,610
Lancel Lannister.

416
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,830
Your cousin and the king's squire.

417
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:16,470
- I was lonely and afraid. - You had a husband.

418
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,430
A husband off whoring every chance he--

419
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,850
His sins do not pardon your own.

420
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,340
May the gods forgive me.

421
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,990
Other men?

422
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:31,900
No.

423
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,790
No others?

424
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,830
No.

425
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:40,790
Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.

426
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,730
You understand this?

427
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,840
I do.

428
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,250
There are those that say your children

429
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,520
were not fathered by King Robert,

430
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,960
that they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

431
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,160
A lie.

432
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,860
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

433
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,900
He wants the throne,

434
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,840
but his brother's children stand in his way.

435
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,070
So he claims they are not his brother's.

436
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,410
That filth.

437
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,690
There is not one shred of truth to it.

438
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,060
I deny it.

439
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,610
Good.

440
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,080
But these are terrible charges.

441
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,160
And the realm must know the truth of them.

442
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,130
If Your Grace has given honest testimony,

443
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,300
your trial will prove your innocence.

444
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,840
Trial? I have confessed.

445
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,180
To a single sin.

446
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,480
Others you have denied.

447
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,250
Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

448
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,480
I bow to the wisdom of your high holiness.

449
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,220
But if I might beg

450
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,630
for just one drop of the Mother's Mercy.

451
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,880
I haven't seen my son--

452
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,810
I don't know how long it's been.

453
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,560
I need to see him, please.

454
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,330
You have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness.

455
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,590
In light of this,

456
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,190
I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

457
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,470
Thank you.

458
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,490
Thank you.

459
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,500
The Mother is merciful.

460
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,020
It is her you should thank.

461
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,650
I will. I will.

462
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,210
I swear it, day and night.

463
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:28,320
Good.

464
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,610
Am I free to go?

465
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,020
After your atonement.

466
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,200
My atonement?

467
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,490
A sinner comes before you.

468
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,760
Cersei of House Lannister.

469
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,270
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.

470
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,900
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

471
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:15,040
She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication.

472
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,600
She has confessed her sins

473
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,530
and begged for forgiveness.

474
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,070
To demonstrate her repentance,

475
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:27,290
she will cast aside all pride, all artifice,

476
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,540
and present herself as the gods made her

477
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,030
to you,

478
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,330
The good people of the city.

479
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,610
She comes before you with a solemn heart,

480
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,680
shorn of secrets,

481
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,980
naked before the eyes of gods and men...

482
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,510
to make her walk of atonement.

483
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,970
Shame. Shame.

484
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,960
Shame.

485
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:19,160
Shame.

486
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,400
Shame. Shame.

487
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,680
Shame.

488
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:30,530
Shame. Shame.

489
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,530
Shame.

490
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,330
Shame. Shame.

491
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:43,530
shame. Shame.

492
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,760
Shame.

493
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,380
Shame.

494
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,870
Shame. Shame.

495
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,510
Shame. Shame.

496
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:58,840
Shame.

497
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,480
Shame.

498
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,610
- Cunt! - Shame.

499
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,790
Whore!

500
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,710
- Shame. - Whore!

501
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,680
Shame.

502
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,810
- Whore! - Whore!

503
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,500
Shame.

504
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,510
Shame.

505
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,170
Shame.

506
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,850
- Whore! - Sinner!

507
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:22,240
- Shame. - Bitch! Brother fucker!

508
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,930
- Whore! - Shame.

509
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,720
- Fuck off! - Shame.

510
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,870
Shame.

511
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,440
All hail the royal tits. You're a bitch!

512
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,340
Shame.

513
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,030
- Get her! - Whore!

514
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,490
- Bitch! - Fucker!

515
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,270
- Fucker! - You bitch!

516
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,740
- Shame. - Cunt!

517
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,650
Shame.

518
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:44,000
Shame. Shame.

519
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,700
- Brother fucker! - Bitch!

520
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,940
I've had half as many cocks as the queen.

521
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,280
- Bitch! - Shame.

522
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,500
- Shame. - Sinner! - Whore! - Slut!

523
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,500
shame.

524
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,520
Shame. Shame.

525
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,490
Whore! Whore, whore.

526
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,200
I'm a Lannister. Suck me off!

527
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,170
- Suck me off, you bitch! - Back!

528
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,290
- Whore! - Shame.

529
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,690
shame.

530
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,350
Whore!

531
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,950
Whore! Whore! Whore!

532
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,930
shame. Shame.

533
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,270
Shame.

534
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,570
shame.

535
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:32,630
Shame.

536
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,870
Shame.

537
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,510
- Bitch! Bitch! - Shame.

538
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,760
Brother fucker!

539
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,680
Shame. Shame.

540
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:54,950
shame.

541
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,250
- Whore! - Brother fucker!

542
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,280
- Whore! - Shame.

543
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,020
Shame. Shame.

544
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:07,680
shame.

545
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,150
Shame.

546
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,250
Shame.

547
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:13,930
shame.

548
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,210
shame.

549
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,730
- Shame. - Fucker!

550
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,090
Shame. Shame.

551
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,210
shame.

552
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,500
Shame. Shame.

553
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,540
shame. Shame.

554
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,500
Shame.

555
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,330
Shame. Shame.

556
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:51,030
Shame. Shame.

557
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,750
Shame.

558
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,700
Shame. Shame.

559
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,170
Shame.

560
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,560
Shame. Shame.

561
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:11,170
Shame. Shame.

562
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,590
Shame.

563
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:54,670
Your grace.

564
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,140
It's good to have you back.

565
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,860
Come.

566
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,210
We'll take you inside.

567
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,070
I need to have a look at those feet.

568
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,620
May I have the honor of

569
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,140
presenting the newest member of the kingsguard?

570
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:40,350
If it please your grace, he has taken a holy vow of silence.

571
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,870
He has sworn that he will not speak

572
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,430
until all his grace's enemies are dead

573
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,620
and evil has been driven from the realm.

574
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,920
Who came to your aid? Stannis.

575
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,910
Now he needs you.

576
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,740
We don't have enough men to make any difference.

577
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,350
The wildlings will make a difference.

578
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,950
The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.

579
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,010
- I told him before. - You saved their bloody lives.

580
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,550
If they're gonna live in the Seven Kingdoms,

581
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:13,110
safe behind our Wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.

582
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,450
- It's not their fight. - Open the gates!

583
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,580
Stannis?

584
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,800
Shireen? The princess?

585
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,710
Lord Commander.

586
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,010
It's one of the wildlings you brought back.

587
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,580
Says he knows your uncle Benjen.

588
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,250
Says he's still alive.

589
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,290
Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

590
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,870
Said he was first ranger.

591
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,760
Said he knows where to find him.

592
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,110
Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome at the last full moon.

593
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,420
- Could be lying. - Could be.

594
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:10,760
There are ways to find out.

595
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,610
- Where is he? - Over there.

597
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,460
For the watch.

598
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,550
For the watch.

599
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:41,860
For the watch.

600
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,730
For the watch.

601
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,890
for the watch.

602
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,570
Olly...

603
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,870
For the watch.
