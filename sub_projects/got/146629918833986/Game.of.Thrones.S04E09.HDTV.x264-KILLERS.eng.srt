5
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:58,746
<i>( wind blowing )</i>

6
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:15,062
<i>( men shouting )</i>

7
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:27,308
What was she like?

8
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:31,645
She...

9
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:35,950
she had red hair.

10
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:39,620
Oh?

11
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:42,089
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

12
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:45,459
I want you to tell me what
it was like to have someone.

13
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:47,461
To be with someone.

14
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:49,296
To love someone and have
them love you back.

15
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,737
We're all gonna die a lot
sooner than I'd planned.

16
00:02:56,771 --> 00:03:00,407
You're the closest
I'll ever get to knowing.

17
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:05,546
So you and Gilly never?

18
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,881
No.

19
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:09,183
She just had a baby.

20
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,387
And she never offered.

21
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,856
But if she had,

22
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:18,559
you would have?

23
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:21,362
You'd have broken
your vows?

24
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,334
The interesting
thing is,

25
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:30,437
our vows never
specifically forbid

26
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:32,473
intimate relations
with women.

27
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,141
What?

28
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:35,368
"I shall take no wife,"

29
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:37,194
yes, that's in there.
There's no denying that.

30
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:40,047
"I shall father no children."
It's very specific.

31
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,850
But what do our vows
have to say about other...

32
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:46,053
activities is open
to interpretation.

33
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,525
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

34
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,999
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

35
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,035
We didn't.

36
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,407
So what's it like?

37
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,977
It's...

38
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:15,015
there's this person,
this whole other person.

39
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,452
And you're wrapped up in them
and they're wrapped up in you.

40
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:20,654
And you--

41
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,690
for a little--

42
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:25,025
for a little while,
you're more than just you.

43
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,295
You're-- I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

44
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,231
No, you're really not.

45
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:32,132
What did I get for it?

46
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:35,102
An arrow six inches
from my heart.

47
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:39,206
There'll be arrows for all
of us soon, I imagine.

48
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:40,841
There will.

49
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,178
They've already done the worst thing
to me they could ever do.

50
00:04:47,015 --> 00:04:49,049
Go get some sleep, Sam.

51
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,318
I'll take this watch.

52
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,346
( screeches )

53
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:25,152
( screeches )

54
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:36,964
Did I ever
tell you about her?

55
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:40,067
- My Sheila?
- Yes.

56
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,436
That was a night
to remember.

57
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,906
Of course, I'd had
a good bit to drink.

58
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,641
( chuckles )

59
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:49,143
Her fangs were sharp,

60
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:51,378
but she knew
how to use them.

61
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:55,182
And she was nice
and soft down below.

62
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:57,818
No, she was no
ordinary beast.

63
00:05:57,852 --> 00:05:59,720
Many is the man who--

64
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,855
I know you never
fucked a bear.

65
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,658
You know you never
fucked a bear.

66
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:07,961
Right now I don't want to think
about the bear you never fucked.

67
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:11,098
Right now all I want
to think about

68
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:13,901
is each one of these arrows finding
its way into a crow's heart.

69
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:17,504
We could be waiting
here a while.

70
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:18,872
Good.

71
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,908
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

72
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:28,515
They came up here
to our land

73
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,085
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

74
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,520
Then they started
hunting us down.

75
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,859
This time, we're the ones
doing the hunting.

76
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:43,364
You've got a lot
to say about killing.

77
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:45,466
Even more words
than arrows.

78
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:49,970
Back in those villages, I killed
just as many of them as you did.

79
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:52,005
More, I reckon.

80
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,110
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

81
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,911
I probably killed
him already.

82
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,380
Styr:
<i>So you've said.</i>

83
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:01,582
And if not,

84
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:05,285
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around my neck.

85
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,154
Styr:
<i>More words.</i>

86
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,523
Know what I think
you do when you see him?

87
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:13,394
Serve him up a nice juicy
slice of ginger minge.

88
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:16,363
( men laughing )

89
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:19,767
You been thinking
about that ginger minge?

90
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:23,637
Wondering what
it tastes like?

91
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,609
Maybe I have.

92
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:31,145
Jon Snow is mine.

93
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,082
Anyone else
tries to kill him,

94
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,885
I'll have
an arrow for them.

95
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:44,324
And not one of your bald friends is
fast enough to stop me.

96
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:10,317
And what is it that couldn't wait
until morning, Tarly?

97
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,486
Maester Aemon.

98
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,055
- How did you know--
- That it was you?

99
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,658
Who else
but Samwell Tarly

100
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:19,593
would be wasting candles

101
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:22,262
to read in the middle
of the night?

102
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,368
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

103
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,772
I know my way
around this library

104
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:34,374
better than any other
place in Castle Black.

105
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,710
Thousands of books

106
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:39,046
and no eyes to read them.

107
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,116
Old age is a wonderful
source of ironies

108
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,319
if nothing else.

109
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,855
But you didn't
answer my question.

110
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,490
What are you reading?

111
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,892
Maester Faull.

112
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,895
Ah, the wildlings.

113
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:58,499
I can assure you that
the closest Maester Faull

114
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:01,902
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

115
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:04,872
But what he says
about what they do,

116
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:06,373
it's all true.

117
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:10,110
It's exactly what the survivors
of their raids report.

118
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:14,982
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

119
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:19,419
Love is the death
of duty.

120
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:23,190
I told that to your friend
Jon Snow once.

121
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:27,461
He didn't listen
and neither did you.

122
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:31,465
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

123
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:35,435
to come here and read
about the terrible things

124
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,606
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

125
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:42,643
I don't love her.

126
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:44,611
- Yes, you do.
- No.

127
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,346
Yes, you do.

128
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:50,551
Heard it in your voice
when you first brought her to me.

129
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:52,819
I remember how it sounds.

130
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,821
I was in love once.

131
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:56,123
You were?

132
00:09:56,157 --> 00:10:00,460
You can imagine
all manner of horrors

133
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,163
befalling that poor
girl and her child.

134
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:05,933
Is it so difficult
to imagine

135
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,868
that an old person
was once,

136
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,070
more or less,
like you?

137
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:12,739
I'm sorry, Maester.

138
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:14,508
I didn't mean it
like that.

139
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:18,412
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

140
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:22,482
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

141
00:10:24,018 --> 00:10:25,819
Of course you do.

142
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:29,590
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

143
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:33,493
A future king
always does.

144
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:37,130
Some of them
were quite forward

145
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:39,866
in their attempts
to win my affections.

146
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:43,303
One of them succeeded.

147
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:46,239
I was very young.

148
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:48,875
Who was she?

149
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,844
Ah.

150
00:10:50,878 --> 00:10:53,447
I could tell you
everything about her.

151
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:55,349
Who she was,

152
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:57,150
how we met,

153
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,319
the color of her eyes,

154
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:02,089
and the shape
of her nose.

155
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:06,159
I can see her

156
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:09,029
right in front of me.

157
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:14,468
She's more real
than you are.

158
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:21,908
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

159
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:24,745
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

160
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,914
than the prospect
of imminent death.

161
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:30,283
Go to bed, Tarly.

162
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,859
Pyp: <i>Sorry, I can't open the gate</i>
<i>for anybody. Orders.</i>

163
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:41,161
Gilly: <i>You don't understand.</i>
<i>They killed everyone.</i>

164
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,263
<i>Everyone but me</i>
<i>and my baby.</i>

165
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:45,666
<i>They're out there.</i>
<i>I saw them on my way here.</i>

<i>They may have followed me. Please.</i>

Pyp:
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

168
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,771
Gilly: <i>If they find us out here,</i>
<i>you don't know...</i>

169
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,606
Pyp!
Open the gate.

170
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,342
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

171
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:57,511
Yes.

172
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:59,579
Thorne gave me strict
orders to not open the gate.

173
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:02,215
Oh, Pyp,
open the fucking gate!

174
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:05,285
I never heard you
curse before.

175
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:07,387
Yes, well,
best get used to it.

176
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,328
Are you all right?

177
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:17,264
- ( panting )
- ( baby fusses )

178
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:19,866
Shh, you're all right.

179
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:23,804
Of course you are,
my brave little fella.

180
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:26,506
- It was horrible.
- I'm so, so sorry.

181
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,341
I didn't know
until I got back.

182
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,843
Don't let them
send me away, Sam.

183
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,745
- Never.
- I know there's no women allowed.

184
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:35,248
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

185
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:38,285
From now on,
wherever you go,

186
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,821
I go, too.

Pick up the pace!

<i>Come on, come on.</i>

205
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:30,530
Here we go, boys,
there's one.

206
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:33,733
Let's go.
There's two.

207
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:38,839
Let's get the next load.

208
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:44,277
That's the last
of the oil, Ser Alliser.

209
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,381
100,000 you say?

210
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,584
Yes, Ser.

211
00:14:50,618 --> 00:14:52,919
You can say it
if you like.

212
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:56,823
We should have sealed
the tunnel while we had the chance,

213
00:14:56,858 --> 00:15:00,227
like you suggested.

214
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:03,496
It was a difficult
decision either way, Ser.

215
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:09,302
Do you know what leadership
means, Lord Snow?

216
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:12,405
It means that the person in
charge gets second-guessed

217
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,041
by every clever little
twat with a mouth.

218
00:15:15,076 --> 00:15:17,444
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

219
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,279
that's the end--

220
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:22,749
for him, for the clever
little twats,

221
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,484
for everyone.

222
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:27,487
This is not the end.
Not for us.

223
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,656
Not if you lot
do your duty

224
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,225
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

225
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:36,930
And then you get
to go on hating me

226
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,598
and I get
to go on wishing

227
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,101
your wildling whore
had finished the job.

228
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,770
<i>( horn blows )</i>

229
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:05,926
Sam: <i>You'll be safe</i>
<i>down here.</i>

230
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,861
I'll check on you
as soon as I can.

231
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,830
You're leaving me again?

232
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:13,533
I'm not leaving you.

233
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,336
You're going up there and we're
staying down here. That's leaving.

234
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,738
You said from now on
we'd stay together.

235
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,775
I didn't mean
in the same room.

236
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,109
What are you going
to do out there?

237
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:24,511
- Help my brothers.
- How?

238
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,181
You're going to fight the free folk
when they come?

239
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:31,051
They'll kill you.
In Mole's Town, they killed everyone.

240
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:34,688
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

241
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:37,557
Why not?
You won't matter up there.

242
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,225
You will down here.

243
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:43,496
I am a man of
the Night's Watch, Gilly.

244
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:45,799
I made a promise
to defend the Wall

245
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,667
and I have to keep it

246
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,270
because that's
what men do.

247
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,118
Promise me
you won't die.

248
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:11,324
I promise you
I won't die.

249
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,800
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

250

- ( men shouting )
- ( horse whinnies )

251
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:48,528
There's a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the Wall than this side.

252
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:51,664
We've got loads
of weapons and things.

253
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,600
It's the perfect place
for us to be.

254
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,835
I've never thrown
a spear before.

255
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,738
I've never held a sword
with a proper edge.

256
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:01,441
This is no place
for me to be.

257
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:04,811
You're not afraid?

258
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:07,313
Of course I'm afraid.

259
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:09,849
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

260
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:11,317
If you're afraid
of a band of wildlings,

261
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:14,621
how in seven hells did you
manage to kill a white walker?

262
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:22,762
I didn't know
I was going to kill it.

263
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,532
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

264
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,567
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

265
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,839
If someone had asked
me my name right then,

266
00:18:32,873 --> 00:18:34,574
I wouldn't have known.

267
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,279
I wasn't
Samwell Tarly anymore.

268
00:18:39,313 --> 00:18:42,048
I wasn't a steward
in the Night's Watch

269
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,818
or son of Randyll Tarly
or any of that.

270
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:48,154
I was nothing at all.

271
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,991
And when you're
nothing at all,

272
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:54,661
there's no more reason
to be afraid.

273
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:58,465
But you're afraid now?

274
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,967
Yes, well...

275
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,938
I'm not nothing anymore.

Most of their men
are up top.

Didn't count more
than 20 down here.

Leftovers.

279

They got a big fat one and
a little bony one manning the front.

280
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:32,599
How high are the walls?

281

Well, we'll be up and over before they
know what's happened.

324
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:40,880
( screams )

325
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:45,284
Come on!
Come on!

326
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:51,657
Brothers!

327
00:23:51,692 --> 00:23:55,261
100 generations
have defended this castle.

328
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:58,064
She's never fallen before.

329
00:23:58,098 --> 00:23:59,532
She will not fall tonight.

330
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:02,702
Those are Thenns
at our walls.

331
00:24:02,736 --> 00:24:05,037
They eat the flesh
of the men they kill.

332
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:08,241
Do you want to fill
the belly of a Thenn tonight?

333
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,575
Men:
No!

334
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,110
Tonight we fight.

335
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,546
<i>And when the sun rises,</i>
<i>I promise you,</i>

336
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,481
Castle Black will stand!

337
00:24:15,516 --> 00:24:16,582
( cheering )

338
00:24:16,617 --> 00:24:18,818
The Night's Watch
will stand.

339
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,187
( cheering )

340
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:25,625
With me now!
Now with me!

341
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:27,593
( shouting )

342
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:05,064

00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:07,467

<i>( men shouting )</i>

No discipline.
No training.

346
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:27,153
Gang of thieves,
that's all this is.

347
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:29,956
<i>I commanded the City Watch</i>
<i>of King's Landing.</i>

348
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,858
<i>Those men obeyed orders.</i>

349
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,693
We can't just let
them attack the gate!

350
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:37,063
The bars of those gates
are four inches of cold-rolled steel.

351
00:25:37,097 --> 00:25:39,565
Those are giants riding
mammoths down there!

352
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,068
Do you think your cold-rolled steel
is gonna stop them?

353
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:43,369
No such thing
as giants.

354
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:46,105
<i>A story</i>
<i>for the children.</i>

355
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:49,876
Brother Slynt.

356
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,712
We just got word
that Ser Alliser needs you below.

357
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:57,750
You're the most experienced man
he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

358
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:00,453
Needed below?

359
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,655
Yes. Yes.

360
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:15,334
Archers, nock your arrows!

361
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,870
Man:
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

362
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:19,605
Draw!

363
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:23,242
Loose!

364
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:39,325
They won't summit
before dawn.

365
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,393
How do you know that?

366
00:26:40,427 --> 00:26:42,495
Because I've made
that climb.

367
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,631
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

368
00:26:48,368 --> 00:26:50,236
<i>Hold the bridge!</i>

369
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,405
<i>Hold, wait for it!</i>

370
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:55,274
<i>Come on with the rocks!</i>

371
00:27:00,914 --> 00:27:02,381
Nock!

372
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:05,751
Draw!

373
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:10,723

374
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:17,063

( screaming )
No! No!

379
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:28,934
To the gate.
Come on, let's move.

380
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:34,273
It's gonna open.

381
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,407
I got one right through the heart.
He's dead.

382
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:43,843
- Oh, is it over?
- No.

383
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:45,745
Well, then...

384
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:56,322
You're all right.
You're all right.

<i>( gurgling )</i>

00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,561
Shh. Shh.

388
00:30:02,596 --> 00:30:04,897
Maester Aemon is coming.

389
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,866
He's gonna make
it all right.

390
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,202
Shh. Shh.

391
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:20,980
- Now.
- Now!

392
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:48,674

( gates creaking )

396
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:55,741
The outer gate
won't hold.

397
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,711
Take five men,
hold the inner gate.

398
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:00,145
Aye.

399
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:04,483
Hold the gate.

400
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:06,819
If they make it through...

401
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:10,990
They won't.

402
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,694
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.

403
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:18,898
- You three, on me.
- <i>( horn blowing )</i>

00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:27,106
Oil.

Oil on the ramp!

407
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,654
Protect the gate!

409
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:16,555
- ( groans )
- Get him inside.

410
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,761
Hold the fucking gate!

411
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:24,930
Hold it!

412
00:34:23,423 --> 00:34:24,923
We need more men
down here.

413
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,459
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

414
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,762
Tell Jon.
He's in command.

415
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:32,197
Let's go.

416
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,008
Get me to the top!
You hear me?!

417
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:49,915
Your name's Olly, right?

418
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:53,185
Listen to me, Olly.
Get me to the top.

419
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,221
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

420
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,991
You hear me?

421
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:06,231
Find a weapon, Olly.
Fight them.

- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

- <i>Quickly.</i>

434
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:34,419
What are you
doing up here?

435
00:36:34,454 --> 00:36:36,955
The wildlings
are over the walls.

436
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,790
Ser Alliser's fallen.

437
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:41,493
The castle won't stand
much longer.

438
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:46,165
Edd, you have the Wall.

439
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,903
If they try the mammoths
again, drop fire on them.

440
00:36:50,937 --> 00:36:53,705
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

441
00:36:59,212 --> 00:37:02,414
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!

442
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:06,285
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

443
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:08,287
Light the fuckers up!

444
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:11,456
<i>Nock! Draw!</i>

How are we
gonna stop that?

447
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:25,704
Shot 20 arrows
in him already.

448
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:27,172
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.

449
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,640
Jon Snow's not
Lord Commander.

450
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:30,342
We hold the gate!

451
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:41,720
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.

452
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:42,955
The gods aren't down here.

453
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:44,623
It's the six of us.
You hear me?

454
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:53,265
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

455
00:37:53,299 --> 00:37:55,701
<i>It shall not end</i>
<i>until my death.</i>

456
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,203
I shall take no wife,

<i>father no children.</i>

I shall wear no crown

I shall live and die
at my post.

460
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:06,545
All: I am the sword
in the darkness.

461
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:08,380
I am the watcher
on the walls.

462
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:11,383
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

463
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:15,454
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch

464
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:18,156
for this night
and all the nights to come!

- ( shouting )
- ( roaring )

466
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,364
I don't want you
out there.

467
00:38:25,398 --> 00:38:27,633
You can't
protect me forever.

468
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:30,269
There won't be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

469
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:35,641
I need him
more than I need you.

470
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:51,683
We need you, boy.

Do you remember the cave?

00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:29,174
We should have
stayed in the cave.

482

We'll go back there.

00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,893
They've had enough
for one night.

489
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,728
( cheering )

490
00:43:59,031 --> 00:44:01,399
Don't cheer too loud.

491
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:05,804
They still outnumber us
1,000 to one.

492
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:11,943
( groaning )

493
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:14,079
( roaring )

494
00:44:14,113 --> 00:44:15,847
Tormund.

495
00:44:15,881 --> 00:44:18,450
It's over.

496
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:19,818
Let it end.

497
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:22,153
This is how a man ends.

498
00:44:30,129 --> 00:44:31,663
Put him in chains.

499
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:34,599
We'll question him later.

500
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:39,704
I should have
thrown you

501
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:42,741
from the top
of the Wall, boy!

502
00:44:42,775 --> 00:44:44,809
Aye.

503
00:44:44,844 --> 00:44:46,878
You should have.

504
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:50,315
<i>( lock clicking )</i>

505
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:53,985
<i>( door opens )</i>

506
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,688
Whoa, it's me.
It's me.

507
00:45:00,526 --> 00:45:02,360
I promised you,
didn't I?

508
00:45:05,531 --> 00:45:07,732
<i>( scuffles )</i>

509
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:19,044
Sam:
We held them off.

510
00:45:19,078 --> 00:45:21,046
Jon:
For one night.

511
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,415
This is a great
victory.

512
00:45:23,449 --> 00:45:25,617
A great victory?

513
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:29,421
Mance was testing
our defenses.

514
00:45:29,455 --> 00:45:31,056
He almost
made it through.

515
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,892
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

516
00:45:33,926 --> 00:45:36,661
He has 1,000 times
as many men.

517
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:42,567
They'll hit us
again tonight.

518
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:45,036
Maybe we can hold them
off for a day or two,

519
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:46,838
but we'll never
beat them.

520
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,407
Where are we going?

521
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:51,109
Going to find Mance.

522
00:45:51,143 --> 00:45:53,845
To fi---
you can't do that.

523
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,747
<i>No one gave you</i>
<i>any orders.</i>

524
00:45:57,483 --> 00:45:59,884
Who's left
to give orders?

525
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:02,654
The wildling army's only
an army because of Mance.

526
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:05,423
He united
100 warring tribes.

527
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,492
Without Mance,
they lose their leader.

528
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:10,228
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.

529
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:12,063
Scatter back
to their homes.

530
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:14,265
Without Mance?

531
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,734
You're going to kill him?

532
00:46:15,768 --> 00:46:17,068
I'm gonna try.

533
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:18,937
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

534
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:21,172
And even if they did,
even if you managed to kill him--

535
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:23,775
They'll kill me?
If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.

536
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:25,243
They'll kill
the rest of us, too.

537
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:27,812
Sam:
<i>They won't just kill you.</i>

538
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:29,714
They'll boil you.
They'll flay you.

539
00:46:29,749 --> 00:46:31,249
They'll make it last days.

540
00:46:34,053 --> 00:46:37,589
You're right.
It's a bad plan.

541
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:41,626
What's your plan?

542
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,071
They held the gate.

543
00:47:36,282 --> 00:47:38,850
Get some brothers
down here to help you.

544
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,288
We need to burn
the bodies.

545
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:07,111
Raise the outer gate.

546
00:48:07,146 --> 00:48:09,681
Then lower it again
as soon as I'm out.

547
00:48:21,093 --> 00:48:22,594
What are you doing?

548
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:25,330
I promised Mormont
I'd never lose it again.

549
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:31,836
In case I don't come back.

550
00:48:39,645 --> 00:48:41,679
Jon.

551
00:48:46,352 --> 00:48:48,119
Come back.

552
00:48:57,096 --> 00:48:59,364
