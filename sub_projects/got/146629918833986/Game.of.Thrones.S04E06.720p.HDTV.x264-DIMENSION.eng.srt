1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,643
<i>You're accused of killing the king.</i>

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,310
Except I didn't do it.

3
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:05,709
Which is why
we're having a trial.

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:07,950
One of my three judges
is my father.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,443
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

6
00:00:10,568 --> 00:00:12,346
I would like you
to be the third.

7
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:15,033
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council.

8
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,809
I never realized you had such respect
for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

9
00:00:18,834 --> 00:00:20,081
What good is power

10
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:21,768
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

11
00:00:21,793 --> 00:00:23,012
We can avenge them.

12
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:25,353
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

13
00:00:25,378 --> 00:00:27,820
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

14
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:29,115
It would be a great honor.

15
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,371
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

16
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:32,992
I'll speak to mine.

17
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:34,943
You've started wars
to protect this family.

18
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:36,690
What does Tyrion deserve

19
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,512
for lighting
that future on fire?

20
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,037
What kind of Knight
beats a helpless girl?

21
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:42,683
The kind who serves
his King.

22
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:45,061
The next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

23
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:48,238
How many hands have you
betrayed, Pycelle?

24
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:49,330
I am your loyal servant.

25
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:50,841
Throw him in one of the black cells.

26
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,538
Oh, no. No, no, no.

27
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,986
There are many who know
that without you

28
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:57,163
this city faced
certain defeat.

29
00:00:57,188 --> 00:00:59,282
<i>The King won't give</i>
<i>you any honors,</i>

30
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:01,077
but we will not forget.

31
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,595
The city is yours.

32
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,645
<i>All these people,</i>
<i>they're your subjects now.</i>

33
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,784
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice

34
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:07,839
with mercy.

35
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:11,089
I will answer injustice
with justice.

36
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:15,638
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

37
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:18,133
Theon's favorite toy.

38
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,073
He cried when I took it
away from him.

39
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:24,238
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

40
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:26,310
<i>and I'm going</i>
<i>to bring him home.</i>

41
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:28,820
We need to look east
for ships and men.

42
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,043
Soldiers win wars.

43
00:01:30,068 --> 00:01:31,160
We don't have any gold.

44
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:33,043
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

45
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:34,882
Which means you're
running out of time.

Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that--

51
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:35,570
We've been here
since midday.

52
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:47,683
Easterners have a difference sense
of time, I've often found.

53
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:51,720
Once I was waiting
for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.

54
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,389
Together, we were
going to run

55
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,925
three shiploads
of the finest--

56
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:26,321
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

57
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:29,624
Please, sit.

58
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:54,716
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

59
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,718
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

60
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:58,987
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

61
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:01,957
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

62
00:06:05,828 --> 00:06:08,163
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

63
00:06:08,197 --> 00:06:10,065
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

64
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,600
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

65
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:14,536
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

66
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,239
He shares no blood
with me.

67
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:20,675
He is a bastard
born of incest.

68
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,744
<i>As was his brother</i>
<i>before him.</i>

69
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,547
Yes, we have heard
this story.

70
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,216
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

71
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,586
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

72
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:34,022
A story about
a jealous uncle

73
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:36,258
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

74
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:41,229
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

75
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:42,964
Gold you loaned him.

76
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:47,202
And you feel your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

77
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,871
More than any man living.

78
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:52,808
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

79
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:55,977
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

80
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:58,513
and "blood right."

81
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:01,683
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

82
00:07:01,717 --> 00:07:03,919
We prefer the stories
they tell.

83
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:05,854
More plain.

84
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,324
Less open
to interpretation.

85
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,463
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

86
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:15,864
4,000.

87
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,866
<i>And how many ships</i>
<i>do you have?</i>

88
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,135
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

89
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:22,637
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

90
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:26,041
32.

91
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:27,809
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

92
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:30,178
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

93
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:34,983
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

94
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,987
None.

95
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,857
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

96
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:45,026
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

97
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:48,797
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>we must respectfully</i>

98
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:51,900
<i>decline your request.</i>

99
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:55,036
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

100
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:05,247
My lord.

101
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,983
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

102
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:10,152
You would not be
either here.

103
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:12,087
In Braavos,

104
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:15,357
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

105
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:16,925
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

106
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,527
That would be the pirates.

107
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:21,963
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

108
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,500
This is the payment
that was demanded

109
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,835
by King Stannis
for my crimes.

110
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,271
I consider it
an honest accounting.

111
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:31,773
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

112
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:34,242
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

113
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:37,045
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

114
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:38,413
The war is over.

115
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:40,916
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

116
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,918
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

117
00:08:42,952 --> 00:08:45,086
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

118
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:48,723
- <i>Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

119
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:49,495
67.

120
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,691
67. And when he dies,
who's in command?

121
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:54,296
A half-grown boy,

122
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,598
<i>the product of incest?</i>

123
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:59,434
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

124
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:02,137
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

125
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:04,272
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

126
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:07,943
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

127
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:10,612
That is a problem
for another time.

128
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:12,881
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

129
00:09:14,283 --> 00:09:17,052
There's only one reliable leader
left in Westeros.

130
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,887
Stannis.

131
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,789
He's got the birthright.

132
00:09:20,823 --> 00:09:22,958
He's in his prime.

133
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:24,693
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

134
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:26,962
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

135
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,330
he does it.

136
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:35,437
<i>The lookout sees a pirate ship</i>
<i>sailing their way.</i>

137
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,472
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

138
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:39,341
"Bring me
my red shirt."

139
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,344
The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

140
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:44,279
And when the pirates
try to board,

141
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,681
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

142
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:50,085
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

143
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,920
"Two pirate ships!"

144
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:55,757
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

145
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,759
But the courageous
captain hollers,

146
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:59,594
"Bring me
my red shirt!"

147
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:01,863
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

148
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:05,734
"Captain, why do you
call for your red shirt before battle?"

149
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:07,335
The captain replies,

150
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,172
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

151
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:13,408
The next morning
the lookout screams,

152
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,910
"10 pirate ships!

153
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:18,747
We are surrounded!"

154
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,548
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

155
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,084
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

156
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:25,220
<i>waiting for his</i>
<i>usual command.</i>

157
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,255
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

158
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,691
"Bring me my brown pants!"

159
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:35,964
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

160
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:39,434
Davos.

161
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,836
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon
in Dragonstone.

162
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:44,205
Only half rotted.

163
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,910
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

164
00:10:48,944 --> 00:10:51,846
This is Lhara.

165
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,448
- And this is--
- I am Lhara.

166
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:59,154
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

167
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:02,557
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

168
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,992
We?

169
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:06,227
You, me-- we.

170
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:11,533
Once I thought
this man loved me.

171
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:15,704
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>he despises me.</i>

172
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:20,108
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold--

173
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,720
You won't be alone.

174
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,288
And you won't be poor.

175
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:43,665
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

176
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:45,567
I gave it to your wife.

177
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:51,272
You're not my friend,
my friend.

178
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,876
I'll see you at sunrise.

179
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,148
"I give you until
the full moon

180
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:03,785
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

181
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:07,489
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks you call home.</i>

182
00:12:07,523 --> 00:12:09,524
On the first night
of the full moon,

183
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:12,327
I will hunt down
every islander still on our lands

184
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:14,262
and flay them living,

185
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:16,965
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

186
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,566
I found
at Winterfell.

187
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:22,437
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

188
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,974
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

189
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:28,777
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

190
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,947
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

191
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:35,150
<i>with more Theon.</i>

192
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:37,185
<i>Signed Ramsay Snow,</i>

193
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:40,622
<i>natural born son</i>
<i>of Roose Bolton,</i>

194
00:12:40,656 --> 00:12:42,624
<i>Lord of the Dreadfort</i>

195
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:45,593
<i>and Warden of the North."</i>

196
00:12:45,628 --> 00:12:47,595
Yes!

197
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,764
<i>They skinned our countrymen</i>

198
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,567
<i>and they mutilated</i>
<i>my brother,</i>

199
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,936
<i>your prince.</i>

200
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,038
<i>Your prince.</i>

201
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:59,808
<i>Everything</i>
<i>they've done to him,</i>

202
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,910
<i>they've also</i>
<i>done to you.</i>

203
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,378
Yes! Yes!

204
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:07,315
<i>As long as they can hurt</i>
<i>our prince with impunity,</i>

205
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:11,352
<i>the word ironborn</i>
<i>means nothing.</i>

206
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:37,212
Go left.

207
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:48,356
- Theon Greyjoy.
- I don't know--

208
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:49,724
I'm here
for Theon Greyjoy.

209
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:51,092
Take me to the dungeons.

210
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:53,361
He's not in the dungeons.

211
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,888
- Last cage on the right.
- Thank you.

212
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:24,392
<i>This way!</i>

213
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,774
We're going home.

214
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,511
No!

215
00:14:45,714 --> 00:14:49,684
It's all right.
It's me, Yara.

216
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,853
You can't trick me.

217
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,055
Tell him. Tell him you
couldn't trick me.

218
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:55,890
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

219
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,292
Not Theon! Reek!

220
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:59,060
- Reek! My name is Reek!
<i>- They're here.</i>

221
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:00,562
If they catch us
in here, we're trapped.

222
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:02,263
Help me with him.

223
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:04,165
No, you can't!

224
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,967
- You can't!
- You're Theon Greyjoy.

225
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:10,138
No, I don't believe her!
I know who I am!

226
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:13,441
I'm Reek! Reek!
Loyal Reek!

227
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:16,277
Good Reek!
I've always been Reek!

228
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:29,624
This is turning into
a lovely evening.

229
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:47,475
<i>I'm Reek!</i>

230
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:49,444
Loyal Reek!

231
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,853
Aah!
Theon!

232
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:15,336
Give me my brother
and no more of your men will die.

233
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:18,373
You've got bigger balls
than he ever did.

234
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:24,145
But with those big balls
of yours...

235
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,285
how fast can you run?

236
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:36,324
<i>cage rattling )</i>

237
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,732
Make for the ship, now.

238
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,467
But your brother.

239
00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:48,469
My brother is dead.

240
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:58,913
I have a treat for you.

241
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:00,648
A reward.

242
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:03,217
Reward?

243
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:05,520
Yes, Reek.

244
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:08,456
Those creatures
who came in the night,

245
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,125
they wanted
to take you away.

246
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,094
And you didn't let them.

247
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:15,530
You remained loyal.

248
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:19,467
I-- I didn't want
them to take me.

249
00:17:20,803 --> 00:17:22,236
I was so scared.

250
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:24,572
- I didn't want them--
- Yes, yes, Reek.

251
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,783
It's a bath.

252
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:38,186
For you.

253
00:17:41,323 --> 00:17:43,891
Remove those rags.

254
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:46,928
Now.

255
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:05,546
The britches, too, Reek.

256
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:07,181
Take them off.

257
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:36,103
Do you love me, Reek?

258
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:44,579
Yes, of course, my lord.

259
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:47,849
Good.

260
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:50,218
Because I need you
to do something for me.

261
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,320
Something very important.

262
00:19:52,354 --> 00:19:55,623
There's a castle, you see.

263
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:58,726
Some bad men
hold this castle.

264
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,964
I need your help
to take this castle back.

265
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:08,236
But how can--

266
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,773
I need you to play a role.

267
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:16,878
To pretend to be someone
you're not.

268
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,617
Pretend to be who?

269
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:25,453
Theon Greyjoy.

270
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:31,292
goats bleating )

271
00:22:11,893 --> 00:22:13,294
He is a goatherd.

272
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:16,864
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

273
00:22:16,898 --> 00:22:19,500
I thank him
for his prayers.

274
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:36,951
It was your dragons,
he says.

275
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:40,554
<i>They came this morning</i>
<i>for his flock.</i>

276
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:46,660
He hopes he has not
offended Your Grace,

277
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,329
but now he has nothing.

278
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,565
Tell this man I am sorry
for his hardship.

279
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,403
<i>I cannot bring back his goats,</i>

280
00:22:55,437 --> 00:23:00,274
but I will see he is paid
their value three times over.

281
00:23:16,658 --> 00:23:18,859
Send the next one in.

282
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:54,495
Queen Daenerys.

283
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:56,597
Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

284
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,666
I thank you.

285
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,702
Mine is one of the oldest and
proudest families in Meereen.

286
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:04,371
Then it is my honor
to receive you.

287
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:07,341
My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

288
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,344
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

289
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:12,680
and maintenance
of its greatest landmarks.

290
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:14,248
This pyramid included.

291
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:16,450
For that,
he has my gratitude.

292
00:24:16,485 --> 00:24:18,152
I should be honored
to meet him.

293
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:19,620
You have, Your Grace.

294
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,455
You crucified him.

295
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:25,759
I pray you'll
never live to see

296
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:27,761
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

297
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:31,298
Your father crucified
innocent children.

298
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:34,802
My father spoke out
against crucifying those children.

299
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:38,038
He decried it as a criminal act,
but was overruled.

300
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:41,408
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

301
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:43,878
I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

302
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:47,281
but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

303
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:50,084
You'd be wise
to remember that.

304
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:53,053
What's done is done.

305
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:56,223
You are the queen
and I am a servant of Meereen.

306
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:59,927
A servant who does not wish
to see its traditions eradicated.

307
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:02,763
And what traditions
do you speak of?

308
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:04,798
<i>The tradition</i>
<i>of funeral rite.</i>

309
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,134
Proper burial in
the Temple of the Graces.

310
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:11,705
My father and 162
noble Meereenese

311
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,074
are still nailed
to those posts,

312
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:17,278
carrion for vultures,
rotting in the sun.

313
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:29,356
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

314
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,592
so that they might receive
proper burials.

315
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:35,796
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

316
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,299
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

317
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:42,002
<i>Would you have begged</i>
<i>me for their right to a proper burial?</i>

318
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:44,738
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

319
00:25:44,806 --> 00:25:48,709
I can only speak to you as a son
who loved his father.

320
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:50,978
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

321
00:25:51,012 --> 00:25:53,881
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

322
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:55,416
and buried with dignity

323
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,818
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

324
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:04,725
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

325
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,732
Thank you, my queen.

326
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:24,712
How many more?

327
00:26:24,746 --> 00:26:28,015
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

328
00:26:28,116 --> 00:26:30,851
212?

329
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:40,828
Send the next one in.

330
00:26:42,764 --> 00:26:45,466
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

331
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,602
I was up late last night.

332
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:52,640
So, does this mean
I am a master of something now?

333
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:54,541
Coins, ships?

334
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,810
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

335
00:26:56,845 --> 00:27:00,080
that I shall be the Master of Ships
long before you--

336
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:07,087
Lord Tywin,
it's a great honor

337
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:09,556
to have been granted a seat on
this council. I--

338
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:11,592
<i>The trial begins</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

339
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:13,794
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

340
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:15,296
Shall we begin?

341
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,331
Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

342
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:20,167
in the Riverlands,
my lord.

343
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:21,535
A coward and a traitor.

344
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:25,839
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

345
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:28,575
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

346
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,377
Disgraceful.

347
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:32,246
<i>What would it take to make</i>
<i>the common soldier</i>

348
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,548
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

349
00:27:34,582 --> 00:27:37,151
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

350
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:40,020
Make it 100.
What else?

351
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:42,623
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

352
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,191
The Targaryen girl?

353
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:47,027
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

354
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:50,664
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

355
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,266
Conquered with what?

356
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,234
<i>She commands an army</i>
<i>of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

357
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:56,270
Some 8,000 strong.

358
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:58,605
She has a company
of sellswords--

359
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,007
the Second Sons.

360
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,443
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her--</i>

361
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:05,746
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

362
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,815
And she has
three dragons.

363
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:09,249
Baby dragons.

364
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:11,418
Larger every year,
Your Grace.

365
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:14,922
Mormont is spying
on her for us.

366
00:28:14,956 --> 00:28:17,925
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

367
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,961
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

368
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:23,630
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

369
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:25,466
a bit harder
than anticipated.

370
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,401
He's an old man.

371
00:28:27,435 --> 00:28:29,336
He wasn't fit
to protect my son.

372
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:31,405
Joffrey didn't die
on his watch.

373
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:34,742
Dismissing him was as insulting
as it was stupid.

374
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:37,878
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

375
00:28:37,912 --> 00:28:41,482
A child with two
seasoned warriors counseling her

376
00:28:41,516 --> 00:28:44,752
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

377
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:46,820
Lord Varys is right.

378
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:49,356
I have been to Essos
and seen the Unsullied firsthand.

379
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:52,893
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

380
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:54,661
Less so in the bedroom.

381
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:57,464
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

382
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:00,033
Armies win them
all the time.

383
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:02,302
She must be dealt with.

384
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:04,371
How, my lord?

385
00:29:04,406 --> 00:29:05,739
By force?

386
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:07,808
Eventually,
if it comes to that.

387
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:12,913
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

388
00:29:12,947 --> 00:29:14,948
Most certainly,
my Lord Hand.

389
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:17,918
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

390
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,686
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

391
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:42,743
Prince Oberyn.

392
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:45,179
Lord Varys...

393
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:48,415
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

394
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,984
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

395
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,853
And yet everyone does.

396
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:57,825
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

397
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,793
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

398
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:02,496
Five years.

399
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,131
May I ask why?

400
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:07,000
'Tis a big
and beautiful world.

401
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:09,703
Most of us live and die

402
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:11,438
in the same corner
where we were born

403
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:14,374
and never get to see
any of it.

404
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:17,010
I don't want to be
most of us.

405
00:30:17,045 --> 00:30:19,046
Most of us
aren't princes.

406
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:23,917
You are from Essos.

407
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,787
Where? Lys?

408
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:29,823
<i>I have an ear</i>
<i>for accents.</i>

409
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:31,525
I've lost
my accent entirely.

410
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,060
I have an ear
for that as well.

411
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,130
<i>How did you get here?</i>

412
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:38,765
It's a long story.

413
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,768
One you don't like
telling people.

414
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:44,404
People I trust.

415
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:47,508
My paramour Ellaria,
she would find you very interesting.

416
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:49,843
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

417
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:52,913
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they serve here.

418
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:56,116
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

419
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,388
You did like boys before?

420
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:05,359
Really?

421
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:07,261
Girls? Hmm.

422
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:09,963
I hope you won't be offended when I say
I never would have guessed.

423
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,431
Not at all.

424
00:31:11,466 --> 00:31:14,301
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

425
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:16,737
- What then?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

426
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:19,573
Everybody is interested
in something.

427
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:21,375
<i>Not me.</i>

428
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:23,610
When I see what
desire does to people,

429
00:31:23,645 --> 00:31:25,579
what it's done
to this country,

430
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:28,448
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

431
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:32,920
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>the absence of desire</i>

432
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:36,056
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

433
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,758
Such as?

434
00:32:12,894 --> 00:32:15,963
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

435
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,047
Really?

436
00:32:35,516 --> 00:32:37,050
Father's orders.

437
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:40,854
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

438
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:53,233
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

439
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,349
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

440
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:44,117
<i>First of my Name,</i>

441
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,453
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

442
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,089
and Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms,

443
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:52,859
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

444
00:33:52,894 --> 00:33:56,029
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

445
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:59,966
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

446
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:03,904
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

447
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:07,240
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

448
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:09,643
And if found guilty...

449
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:13,547
may the gods
punish the accused.

450
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,551
Tyrion of
the House Lannister,

451
00:34:51,586 --> 00:34:55,689
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

452
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:59,359
Did you kill King Joffrey?

453
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:01,962
No.

454
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:04,331
Did your wife,
the Lady Sansa?

455
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:06,800
Not that I know of.

456
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:10,137
How would you say
he died, then?

457
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:12,339
Choked on his pigeon pie.

458
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:15,809
So you would
blame the bakers?

459
00:35:15,843 --> 00:35:18,245
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

460
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:24,184
The crown may call
its first witness.

461
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:26,353
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

462
00:35:26,387 --> 00:35:28,355
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

463
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,724
He slapped the king
across the face

464
00:35:30,758 --> 00:35:33,226
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

465
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:36,997
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

466
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,932
Right here
in this throne room,

467
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:41,835
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

468
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:44,171
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

469
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:46,006
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

470
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,841
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

471
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:50,210
he threatened
to have me killed.

472
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:52,245
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

473
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,081
<i>- Silence.</i>
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

474
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:56,750
while you tore
at her clothes and beat her.

475
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:59,486
Silence!

476
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,423
You will not speak
unless called upon.

477
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:06,960
You're dismissed,
Ser Meryn.

478
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:16,069
Basilisk venom,

479
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:18,605
widow's blood,

480
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,874
wolfsbane,

481
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:23,109
essence of nightshade,

482
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:26,012
sweetsleep,

483
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:28,148
tears of Lys,

484
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:30,417
demon's dance...

485
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,154
blind eye--

486
00:36:34,188 --> 00:36:36,389
I think you have
made your point, Grand Maester.

487
00:36:36,424 --> 00:36:38,258
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

488
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:40,293
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

489
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:43,230
My stores were plundered.

490
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:44,564
By whom?

491
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:47,467
<i>By the accused,</i>
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

492
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:49,903
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

493
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:52,439
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

494
00:36:52,473 --> 00:36:55,475
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

495
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:59,813
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

496
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:02,382
Without question.

497
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,288
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

498
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:09,890
the king's fool.

499
00:37:09,924 --> 00:37:13,960
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

500
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:17,731
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

501
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:21,201
She wore this necklace

502
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:23,436
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

503
00:37:23,471 --> 00:37:26,740
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

504
00:37:26,774 --> 00:37:30,744
and terrible poison
was found inside.

505
00:37:30,778 --> 00:37:34,748
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

506
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:37,851
It was.
The Strangler.

507
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:41,721
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

508
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:46,359
And used to strike down
the most noble child

509
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:49,195
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

510
00:37:57,071 --> 00:37:59,406
<i>"I will hurt you for this.</i>

511
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,208
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

512
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:04,644
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

513
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,780
and you will know
the debt is paid."

514
00:38:06,814 --> 00:38:10,417
Your own brother
said this to you?

515
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,587
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

516
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:18,858
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

517
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:23,129
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

518
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:25,465
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

519
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:29,402
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

520
00:38:30,638 --> 00:38:32,505
Tyrion said,

521
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,208
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

522
00:38:35,242 --> 00:38:37,510
What debt?

523
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:40,480
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

524
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:42,315
in the Tower of the Hand.

525
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,851
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

526
00:38:44,885 --> 00:38:47,487
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

527
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:49,456
He wasn't pleased.

528
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:54,227
Thank you, Your Grace,

529
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:56,563
for the courage
of your testimony.

530
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:14,614
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the precise nature of this threat?</i>

531
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:17,217
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

532
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:21,154
<i>He said, "Perhaps you should speak</i>
<i>more softly to me, then.</i>

533
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:23,089
Monsters are dangerous

534
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:25,558
and just now kings
are dying like flies."

535
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:28,895
And he said this to you at a meeting
of the small council?

536
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:30,163
Yes.

537
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:33,299
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

538
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,602
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

539
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:38,104
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

540
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:40,573
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

541
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:47,047
You're excused,
Lord Varys.

542
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:52,118
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

543
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,893
One.

544
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:04,998
You once said

545
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:08,768
that without me, this city would have
faced certain defeat.

546
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:12,372
You said the histories
would never mention me,

547
00:40:12,406 --> 00:40:15,075
but you would not forget.

548
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,012
Have you forgotten,
Lord Varys?

549
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:23,650
Sadly, my lord,

550
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:26,419
I never forget a thing.

551
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:38,531
We will adjourn for now.

552
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:42,502
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

553
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:44,704
<i>Clear the court!</i>

554
00:41:04,558 --> 00:41:07,160
<i>You'd condemn</i>
<i>your own son to death?</i>

555
00:41:07,194 --> 00:41:09,362
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

556
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:10,897
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

557
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:13,233
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

558
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,701
I know nothing
of the sort.

559
00:41:14,735 --> 00:41:17,237
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

560
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,105
As did I.

561
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,708
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

562
00:41:21,742 --> 00:41:24,611
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

563
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:27,113
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

564
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:29,916
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

565
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,119
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

566
00:41:33,154 --> 00:41:36,222
If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be
punished accordingly.

567
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:38,825
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

568
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:44,430
Once you said family
is what lives on.

569
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:46,466
All that lives on.

570
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,003
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

571
00:41:50,037 --> 00:41:52,906
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

572
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:55,808
I'm a Kingsguard,

573
00:41:55,843 --> 00:41:57,744
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

574
00:41:57,778 --> 00:41:59,479
I'm well aware
of your oath.

575
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:01,614
What happens to your name?

576
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:05,018
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

577
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:07,020
Your nephews?

578
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:08,621
Lancel Lannister?

579
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:10,890
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

580
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:12,592
What happens to my dynasty

581
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:14,861
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

582
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:17,463
It survives through me.

583
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,834
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

584
00:42:21,869 --> 00:42:24,671
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

585
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:27,574
if you let Tyrion live.

586
00:42:27,608 --> 00:42:29,075
Done.

587
00:42:30,611 --> 00:42:34,180
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

588
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:35,949
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

589
00:42:35,983 --> 00:42:39,986
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him
to join the Night's Watch.

590
00:42:41,755 --> 00:42:44,557
<i>In three days' time,</i>
<i>he'll depart for Castle Black</i>

591
00:42:44,592 --> 00:42:46,259
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

592
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,861
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

593
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:50,863
<i>You will leave</i>
<i>King's Landing</i>

594
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:53,099
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

595
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,568
You will marry
a suitable woman

596
00:42:55,603 --> 00:42:58,638
and father children
named Lannister.

597
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:02,575
And you'll never turn your back on
your family again.

598
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,182
You have my word.

599
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:11,017
And you have mine.

600
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:37,277
Not going well,
is it?

601
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,779
- You're going to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

602
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:42,582
When you are, you need to enter
a formal plea for mercy

603
00:43:42,616 --> 00:43:44,851
and ask to be sent
to the Wall.

604
00:43:44,885 --> 00:43:46,853
Father's agreed to it.

605
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:49,622
He'll spare your life and allow you
to join the Night's Watch.

606
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:52,292
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

607
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:54,294
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

608
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:56,229
<i>Father is not Joffrey.</i>
<i>He'll keep his word.</i>

609
00:43:56,263 --> 00:43:58,064
How do you know?

610
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:03,803
Do you trust me?

611
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,342
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

612
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:11,411
This will all be over soon.

613
00:44:27,328 --> 00:44:30,263
The crown may call
its next witness.

614
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:06,766
State your name.

615
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,768
Shae.

616
00:45:08,802 --> 00:45:11,003
Do you swear
by all the gods

617
00:45:11,038 --> 00:45:13,573
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

618
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:16,476
I swear it.

619
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,277
Do you know this man?

620
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:29,188
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

621
00:45:29,223 --> 00:45:31,057
How do you know him?

622
00:45:31,091 --> 00:45:34,360
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

623
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:38,464
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

624
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:40,700
What do you know of this?

625
00:45:42,336 --> 00:45:44,604
I know that he's guilty.

626
00:45:45,939 --> 00:45:48,040
He and Sansa
planned it together.

627
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:51,811
<i>Silence!</i>

628
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:54,347
<i>Continue.</i>

629
00:45:54,381 --> 00:45:57,283
<i>She wanted revenge</i>
<i>for her father,</i>

630
00:45:57,317 --> 00:45:58,818
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

631
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:01,621
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

632
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:04,056
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

633
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:07,727
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

634
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:10,797
He hated you, my lord.

635
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:14,000
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

636
00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:15,868
to put in Joffrey's wine.

637
00:46:15,903 --> 00:46:18,438
<i>How could you possibly</i>
<i>know all this?</i>

638
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:22,275
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

639
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:26,312
I wasn't just her maid.

640
00:46:29,116 --> 00:46:30,783
I was his whore.

641
00:46:30,818 --> 00:46:33,786
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

642
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:35,488
You said you were his...

643
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:37,356
His whore.

644
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:42,695
How did you come
to be in his service?

645
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:44,030
He stole me.

646
00:46:44,064 --> 00:46:45,565
I was with another man,

647
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,133
a knight in
your lordship's army.

648
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:49,702
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

649
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,938
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

650
00:46:51,972 --> 00:46:56,476
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

651
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,011
"You belong to me now,"
he said.

652
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:02,982
"I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world."

653
00:47:05,752 --> 00:47:08,454
Silence.
Silence!

654
00:47:09,756 --> 00:47:11,390
And did you?

655
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:13,926
Did I what?

656
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,629
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

657
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:21,133
I did everything
he wanted.

658
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:23,336
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

659
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,304
Whatever he felt
like doing to me.

660
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:27,540
<i>I kissed him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

661
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:29,108
<i>I licked him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

662
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:32,211
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

663
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:34,146
I was his property.

664
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,415
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

665
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,284
so he could use me
when he was bored.

666
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:42,255
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

667
00:47:42,289 --> 00:47:45,958
I took his face
in my hands and said,

668
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:49,028
"I am yours
and you are mine."

669
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:54,300
Shae.

670
00:47:57,504 --> 00:47:59,572
Please don't.

671
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:04,110
I am a whore.

672
00:48:04,144 --> 00:48:06,712
<i>Remember?</i>

673
00:48:08,682 --> 00:48:10,716
That was before
he married Sansa.

674
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,386
After that,
all he wanted was her.

675
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,988
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

676
00:48:17,457 --> 00:48:20,226
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

677
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:31,437
Father,

678
00:48:31,471 --> 00:48:34,073
I wish to confess.

679
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:38,611
I wish...
to confess.

680
00:48:40,747 --> 00:48:43,249
You wish to confess?

681
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:46,786
I saved you.

682
00:48:48,522 --> 00:48:50,823
I saved this city

683
00:48:50,857 --> 00:48:54,360
and all your
worthless lives.

684
00:48:54,394 --> 00:48:57,897
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

685
00:48:57,931 --> 00:49:00,566
Tyrion.

686
00:49:03,403 --> 00:49:05,938
Do you wish to confess?

687
00:49:09,476 --> 00:49:12,044
Yes, Father.

688
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,580
I'm guilty.

689
00:49:14,615 --> 00:49:17,583
Guilty. Is that what you
want to hear?

690
00:49:17,618 --> 00:49:19,719
You admit you poisoned
the king?

691
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:22,321
No, of that
I'm innocent.

692
00:49:22,356 --> 00:49:26,359
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

693
00:49:26,393 --> 00:49:29,862
I am guilty
of being a dwarf.

694
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:33,466
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

695
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,701
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

696
00:49:35,736 --> 00:49:39,972
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

697
00:49:41,174 --> 00:49:42,875
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

698
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:44,310
<i>Nothing but this--</i>

699
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:47,279
I did not do it.

700
00:49:47,314 --> 00:49:50,249
I did not kill Joffrey,

701
00:49:50,283 --> 00:49:52,585
but I wish that I had.

702
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:55,488
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

703
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:59,592
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

704
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:06,966
I wish I was the monster
you think I am.

705
00:50:08,368 --> 00:50:11,937
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

706
00:50:11,972 --> 00:50:14,140
I would gladly
give my life

707
00:50:14,174 --> 00:50:16,475
to watch you all
swallow it.

708
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,544
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.

709
00:50:18,612 --> 00:50:21,213
Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

710
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:27,119
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

711
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:30,389
<i>And I know I'll get</i>
<i>no justice here.</i>

712
00:50:30,424 --> 00:50:33,693
So I will let
the gods decide my fate.

713
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:38,564
I demand a trial
by combat.
