5
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:16,438
Here we are.

6
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,382
Ready?

7
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,556
"The Rains of Castamere."

8
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,658
You fucking deaf?

9
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:37,960
Same wrong guess
every fucking time.

10
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:39,395
Listen, you cunt.

11
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,597
Oh!

12
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,535
"The Bear
and the Maiden Fair."

13
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:50,239
There's a man
with an ear.

14
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,675
Too bad you got
a hangnail for a cock.

15
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:56,612
First time I saw you
with your breeches down,

16
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:58,314
I thought you were
a eunuch.

17
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,883
You've seen it, girls.

18
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:03,853
Like a baby snail
peeking out of his shell.

19
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,236
Your baby was crying
this morning.

20
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:28,177
Woke me up.

21
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,879
You hear me?

22
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:31,380
Yes.

23
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:33,816
Well, got
anything to say?

24
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,851
I'm sorry
he woke you up.

25
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:39,054
I don't care if you're sorry.

26
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:41,824
Keep that baby quiet

27
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,626
or I will.

28
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,227
Don't you
ever touch him.

29
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:49,531
Little wildling bitch.

30
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:52,601
<i>You should have stayed</i>
<i>with your own kind.</i>

31
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:56,405
<i>You listening to me?</i>

32
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,440
- Shut your mouth.
- What?

33
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,312
It's just an owl,
you dumb bitch.

34
00:04:03,346 --> 00:04:05,614
No, it's not.

35
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:45,781
Shh.

36
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,757
I should never
have left her there.

37
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:59,394
- You couldn't have known.
- Of course I could've known.

38
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:01,963
They've been raiding
the villages close by.

39
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:04,800
And we just cower in here
while they slaughter our brothers.

40
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,635
Our brothers had orders
to stay at Castle Black.

41
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,237
So it's all right, then?
Black Jack and Kegs

42
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:11,139
and Mully chopped to pieces
'cause they broke the rules?

43
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:12,674
<i>I didn't say it</i>
<i>was all right.</i>

44
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,376
I'm saying they shouldn't
have been there.

45
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,912
We're pledged to guard
the realms of men.

46
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,413
She's dead because of me.

47
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:19,981
We can't even guard
Mole's Town.

48
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,583
We can't go after them.
You know that.

49
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,051
It's what they want.

50
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:25,420
And little Sam.

51
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:28,457
As if I cut
their throats myself.

52
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,825
Maybe she managed
to hide herself.

53
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:31,760
<i>I thought</i>
<i>all of you was dead.</i>

54
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:34,062
You went north with Mormont
and no one came back.

55
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:36,131
Not for ages.

56
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:38,033
But then you did.

57
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:41,436
She survived Craster

58
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:44,005
and he was the worst
shit I've ever met.

59
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,707
She survived the long march
to the Wall.

60
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:49,578
<i>She survived a white walker,</i>
<i>for fuck's sake.</i>

61
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:52,280
She might have got out.

62
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:57,018
She might have.

63
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:00,722
If they hit Mole's Town,

64
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:02,824
then we're next.

65
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:07,829
Mance and his army
must be close.

66
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:09,531
<i>100,000 of them.</i>

67
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:12,067
And there's what,
105 of us left?

68
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:14,770
You counting Black Jack,
Kegs, and Mully?

69
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,906
102.

70
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,042
How do 102 men
stop 100,0?

71
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:27,549
Whoever dies last,
be a good lad

72
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,018
<i>and burn the rest of us.</i>

73
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,654
Once I'm done
with this world,

74
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:35,157
I don't want
to come back.

75
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:37,919
<i>You think he was</i>
<i>spying on you?</i>

76
00:08:37,954 --> 00:08:39,554
<i>No, not spying.</i>

77
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,857
<i>The Dothraki think</i>
<i>outsiders are ridiculous</i>

78
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,358
taking shame
in the naked body.

79
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:46,728
They make love under the stars
for the whole khalasar to see.

80
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,432
Yes, Your Grace.

81
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,767
But you are not
Dothraki.

82
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,769
No.

83
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,139
Well, I don't see
why it matters.

84
00:08:58,174 --> 00:08:59,407
Grey Worm
isn't interested.

85
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:01,910
None of the Unsullied care
what's under our clothes.

86
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:07,282
He was interested.

87
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:09,885
What?

88
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:14,389
I believe he was
interested.

89
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,260
When the slavers
castrate the boys,

90
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:20,028
do they take all of it?

91
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:22,130
All of it?

92
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:24,099
The--

93
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,902
the pillar
and the stones.

94
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,640
I don't know,
Your Grace.

95
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:34,409
Haven't you
ever wondered?

96
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:40,248
Yes, Your Grace.

97
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,601
<i>Missandei.</i>

98
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:18,053
The lessons you give I
in common tongue...

99
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:22,924
these are precious to I.

100
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,193
- To me.
- To me.

101
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:28,396
I don't remember teaching
you the word precious.

102
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:31,499
Jorah the Andal,
he teaches I--

103
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:34,336
he teaches me
this word.

104
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:38,039
Do you remember the name
you were given at birth?

105
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:40,875
I remember nothing.

106
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,777
Only Unsullied.

107
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,813
When they cut you,

108
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:47,282
do you remember that?

109
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,686
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,955
I'm sorry they did
that to you.

111
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,691
Why?
Why sorry?

112
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:59,427
It's a terrible thing
to do to a boy.

113
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,002
If the masters
never cut me,

114
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:09,137
I never am Unsullied.

115
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:12,307
I never stand in
the Plaza of Pride

116
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,909
when Daenerys Stormborn
orders us

117
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,845
to kill the masters.

118
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,649
I never am chosen
to lead the Unsullied.

119
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:22,951
I never meet Missandei

120
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,286
from the island of Naath.

121
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:44,239
I am sorry I--

122
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:47,776
for today.

123
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,944
I am sorry.

124
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:37,959
Kraken. Mmm.

125
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:40,628
Strong as long
as they're in the sea.

126
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:43,364
When you take them
out of the water,

127
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,699
no bones.

128
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,935
They collapse
under their proud weight

129
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:49,337
and slump into
a heap of nothing.

130
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:51,606
You'd think
they know that.

131
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,242
Unfortunately,
they're not very bright.

132
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,746
What do you tell them?

133
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,014
I'm Theon Greyjoy,

134
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:02,817
son of Balon,
heir to the Iron Islands.

135
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:06,054
- And what are you really?
- I'm Reek.

136
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:08,089
Are you sure?

137
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,993
You do look very much
like a lord.

138
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:15,296
Formidable, proud.

139
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:17,899
I'm Reek.

140
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,768
Until when?

141
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,836
Always.

142
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:24,105
- Forever.
- That's right.

143
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,509
Until you're rotting
in the ground.

144
00:13:30,246 --> 00:13:34,149
Remember what you are
and what you're not.

145
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:36,618
Bring me Moat Cailin.

146
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:08,683
No closer.

147
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,354
Who are you?

148
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,995
I'm Kenning,

149
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,231
commander of
this garrison.

150
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,034
And you say
you're Theon Greyjoy?

151
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,970
Yes.

152
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:05,073
And why should
I believe that?

153
00:15:05,107 --> 00:15:08,109
I was born on Pyke
to Balon Greyjoy.

154
00:15:08,143 --> 00:15:10,879
His third
and last living son.

155
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,614
I am your prince.

156
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:14,883
I swear it
by the Drowned God.

157
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,252
What is dead
may never die.

158
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:19,320
What is dead
may never die.

159
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:21,623
And if you were
my prince,

160
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:23,958
why are you marching
with a Bolton army?

161
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:26,561
Lord Bolton took me
captive after Winterfell.

162
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:29,564
He sent me to treat
with you in good faith

163
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:30,999
as your fellow ironborn.

164
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,901
And what does
Lord Bolton want?

165
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:37,906
You are fading
from sickness,

166
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,407
you are badly outnumbered,

167
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:41,743
and you're hundreds
of miles from the sea.

168
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,678
Lord Bolton implores you
to protect your men

169
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:47,248
and abandon this fortress
you can no longer hold.

170
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:50,718
Do this, and he will be
just and fair with you

171
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:52,654
as he has been with me.

172
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,625
The Boltons will give you safe
passage to the Stony Shore.

173
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,861
He wants us
to surrender?

174
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:02,630
My own father,
your king,

175
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:05,967
surrendered years ago
to Robert Baratheon.

176
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:08,269
I watched him
bend the knee.

177
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,871
There was no shame there.

178
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,607
He fought with honor,
as did you.

179
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,947
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

180
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:20,848
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear.

181
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,787
"No shame."
"Fought with honor."

182
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:32,060
Only a whipped dog
would speak this way.

183
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,830
Or a woman.

184
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,067
Are you a woman, boy?

185
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,568
You don't know--

186
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,904
The ironborn
will not surrender.

187
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:44,639
Reek. My name is Reek...

188
00:16:44,673 --> 00:16:46,941
You go tell
your master that,

189
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:49,243
Theon Greyjoy,

190
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,279
or whoever the fuck
you are.

191
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:52,981
My name is Reek.

192
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,649
What in the hell
are you muttering?

193
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:56,551
I'm Reek.

194
00:16:57,853 --> 00:16:59,487
Reek.

195
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,162
If we yield, we live?

196
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,164
Is that what it says
on this paper here?

197
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,469
Yes. Have your men raise the
white flag and open the gates.

198
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:16,904
You're going home.

199
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:26,147
<i>You didn't really think</i>
<i>I'd let them go, did you?</i>

200
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,917
It's fallen out
of fashion, flaying.

201
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:32,186
Sad, but true.

202
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:34,222
Traditions
are important.

203
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,557
Where are we
without our history?

204
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:39,060
- Eh?
- Yes, my lord.

205
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,662
Will we go home now?

206
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,799
I believe we will.

207
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,801
To our new home.

208
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:59,947
<i>You have foreign blood,</i>
<i>don't you, Baelish?</i>

209
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:03,484
A great-grandfather
from Braavos, yes.

210
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,087
I suppose
all of our ancestors

211
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,056
came from somewhere
else originally.

212
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,291
<i>Our forebearers</i>
<i>settled the Vale</i>

213
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:11,759
<i>thousands of years ago.</i>

214
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:14,295
<i>We've fought off invaders</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

215
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,830
The beauty of the Vale
is matched only

216
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:18,232
by the nobility
of its great families.

217
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,368
Lady Arryn often told me

218
00:18:20,402 --> 00:18:23,004
that you were her rock,
Lord Royce.

219
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,840
She told me nothing
about you, Baelish.

220
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:28,609
But I didn't need
to hear from her.

221
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:30,778
Moneylender.
Whoremonger.

222
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:33,815
You've been licking Tywin
Lannister's boots so long,

223
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,783
- it's a wonder your tongue's not black.
- My lord--

224
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:39,620
And when Jon Arryn named you
Master of Coin, no one cared.

225
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:41,556
Always been a grubby job.

226
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,791
Why not let
a grubby man do it?

227
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:46,394
<i>But when I heard</i>
<i>you were lurking here,</i>

228
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:48,262
fawning over
the Lady Arryn--

229
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,398
Lady Arryn
invited me.

230
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:53,167
She and I have been
close since childhood.

231
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,770
Yes, we all know
how close you were.

232
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:58,606
<i>Lady Arryn's predilections</i>
<i>were her own affair.</i>

233
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,274
Her death is our affair.

234
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,077
Of course.
Her suicide shattered us all.

235
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,480
She was an odd fish.

236
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:08,249
Everyone knew that.
But suicide?

237
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:11,752
<i>She adored</i>
<i>that boy of hers.</i>

238
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,155
I don't see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.

239
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:17,325
<i>Strange that within days</i>
<i>of your arrival,</i>

240
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,696
you've married Lady Arryn
and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

241
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,798
She was always prone
to melancholy.

242
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:27,335
My lady wasn't meant
for a world as brutal as ours.

243
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,437
We were told there was a witness.
A girl.

244
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:31,806
A niece of yours,
I believe.

245
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:36,244
A girl with no learning
and scattered wits.

246
00:19:36,278 --> 00:19:37,578
I assure you,
she would be of no help.

247
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,714
We'd like
to speak with her.

248
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:44,118
- Let me fetch her.
<i>- No need.</i>

249
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:48,422
We prefer to hear her
testimony unadulterated.

250
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,001
<i>Come closer, child.</i>

251
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:03,437
You have nothing
to fear from us or him.

252
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:06,974
<i>Lord Baelish here</i>
<i>is your uncle?</i>

253
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:09,377
<i>Your name is Alayne?</i>

254
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:14,282
<i>Perhaps you would feel more comfortable</i>
<i>if Lord Baelish left the room.</i>

255
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,083
- My lady--
- I wasn't asking you.

256
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:17,028
He can stay.

257
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:19,258
Speak up, girl, you're not
a damn kitchen mouse.

258
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:21,422
Tell us what you saw.

259
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:26,827
I'm sorry, Lord Baelish.

260
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,729
I have to tell the truth.

261
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,703
I'll tell you
everything.

262
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:40,174
Please, Alayne,
leave nothing out.

263
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:44,278
My name is not Alayne.

264
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:46,781
It's Sansa Stark,

265
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:49,450
eldest daughter
of Lord Eddard Stark.

266
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:52,153
Lord Royce, we met when
you came to Winterfell.

267
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:54,989
You were escorting your son
Ser Waymar to the Wall.

268
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:58,226
Sansa Stark?

269
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,462
You tell lies right to my face,
you little worm?

270
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:04,699
Lord Baelish
has told many lies.

271
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,470
All to protect me.

272
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,773
<i>Since my father</i>
<i>was executed,</i>

273
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,710
I have been a hostage
in King's Landing.

274
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:18,546
A plaything for Joffrey
to torture

275
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,748
or Queen Cersei
to torment.

276
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,417
They beat me,
they humiliated me,

277
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:26,320
they married me
to the Imp.

278
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:29,223
I had no friends
in King's Landing...

279
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:33,094
except one.

280
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:41,369
He saved me.

281
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:44,772
Smuggled me away
when he had the chance.

282
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,743
He knew I'd be safe
here in the Eyrie

283
00:21:48,777 --> 00:21:51,412
with my own blood,
my Aunt Lysa.

284
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:55,983
The Lannisters have
friends everywhere.

285
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,285
<i>Even the Vale.</i>

286
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,521
<i>He made me swear</i>
<i>not to tell anyone my true name.</i>

287
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:03,357
Your secret is safe
with us, my lady.

288
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:05,993
<i>Your father grew up</i>
<i>right here in these halls.</i>

289
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,229
We hunted together
many times.

290
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:09,730
He was a fine man.

291
00:22:09,798 --> 00:22:14,435
Tell us what happened
to your aunt, Sansa.

292
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:19,440
You knew her well,
my lords, my lady.

293
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,809
You knew she was
a troubled woman.

294
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:24,645
She always loved
Lord Baelish.

295
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,414
She told me herself.

296
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:28,949
From the moment he arrived
at the gates of Riverrun,

297
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:33,688
a boy of eight carrying
everything he owned in a little sack.

298
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:38,192
<i>She confessed to me</i>
<i>she never loved Lord Arryn.</i>

299
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:41,729
She did as her father commanded,
as so many of us have.

300
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:45,766
<i>When the gods finally allowed</i>
<i>her to be with Lord Baelish,</i>

301
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,468
she was so happy.

302
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:48,936
For a time.

303
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:53,107
My aunt
was a jealous lady.

304
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:57,878
She was terrified
that Lord Baelish

305
00:22:57,913 --> 00:22:59,180
didn't love her
anymore.

306
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:01,782
That he would abandon
her for a younger woman.

307
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:07,221
And then...

308
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:10,591
one day she saw
him kiss me.

309
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,293
Lady Sansa.

310
00:23:12,327 --> 00:23:15,429
It was a peck on the cheek,
Lord Royce, nothing more.

311
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:19,066
Lord Baelish is my uncle now,
in truth, by marriage.

312
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:22,069
He's always been
so kind to me.

313
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:24,972
I was so happy to be here,
to be free.

314
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,141
All because of him.

315
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:29,410
But my aunt
turned on me.

316
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:32,813
She cursed me.
Called me a whore.

317
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:35,549
Promised to throw me
through the Moon Door.

318
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:38,018
When Lord Baelish tried
to calm her,

319
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,887
she struck him.

320
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:41,622
She said she didn't want
to live anymore.

321
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:43,758
<i>She stood on the edge</i>
<i>of that Moon Door.</i>

322
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,559
He tried
to reason with her.

323
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:48,095
Promised her she was the only one
he had ever loved,

324
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,767
but she stepped through
those doors and she was--

325
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:57,138
Shh.

326
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:01,008
Shh, it's not your fault,
sweet girl.

327
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,582
It's not
your fault.

328
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:26,167
You could see it in the way she
raised that boy.

329
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:29,136
Feeding him from her own teats
when he was 10 years old.

330
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:32,239
Lord Royce!
This is hardly the time.

331
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:34,008
Apologies, my lady.

332
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:35,843
And to you
as well, Baelish.

333
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:37,745
We treated you
/Ca bit harshly.

334
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,580
You want justice,
Lord Royce.

335
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:41,115
I can hardly
complain about that.

336
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,950
I want the same.

337
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:47,621
Not much justice to be meted
out in suicide, is there?

338
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:49,957
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?

339
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,126
Only 20 years ago,
the knights of the Vale

340
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,429
rode behind Jon Arryn,
Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.

341
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:59,133
They fought together
to overcome the Mad King.

342
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:01,035
And since then,
Arryn and Royce,

343
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,670
Corbray, Waynwood,

344
00:25:02,704 --> 00:25:05,906
all the great houses
of the Vale watched from the corner.

345
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,741
A timid boy
at a tavern brawl.

346
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:10,277
Are you questioning
our courage?

347
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:13,214
I want to know
which side you're on.

348
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:14,748
Do you support
the Lannisters,

349
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,884
the house that executed
your friend Ned Stark?

350
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:19,186
Of course we don't
support the damn Lannisters.

351
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:23,157
No? Catelyn Stark begged
her sister for support and Lysa refused.

352
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:26,160
By staying out of the fray,
you've allowed Tywin Lannister

353
00:25:26,194 --> 00:25:28,729
to destroy his rivals
on every compass point.

354
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:30,197
Who stands
against him now?

355
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:32,900
Who would you have
us back, Lord Baelish?

356
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:34,668
Robb Stark is dead.

357
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:37,304
I'd have you back
Robin Arryn,

358
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:39,006
Lord of the Vale.

359
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,008
Robin Arryn is
a sickly little boy.

360
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:44,478
And sickly little boys
sometimes become powerful men.

361
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:46,580
More often
they die young.

362
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:49,149
I adored Lysa
with all my heart.

363
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:53,120
But she loved her son so much,
she became overprotective.

364
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:55,890
He needs to learn
how to swing a sword.

365
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:57,291
How to ride a horse.

366
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:00,160
- Aye, it's time.
- Yes, it's time.

367
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:02,062
Time for him
to tour the Vale,

368
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:04,598
to visit all the castles
in his domain.

369
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:08,002
Time for Robin
to leave the nest.

370
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,723
<i>Ser Barristan.</i>

371
00:26:29,758 --> 00:26:31,592
Yes?

372
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:34,662
Who sent you?

373
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:12,566
- Ser Barristan.
- Ser Jorah.

374
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:15,402
Have I forgotten
a council meeting?

375
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:17,705
No.

376
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:28,248
What's this?

377
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:29,783
A royal pardon

378
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:32,419
signed by
Robert Baratheon.

379
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:48,202
You spied on her.

380
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:51,739
Who gave you this?

381
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:54,174
Does it matter?

382
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:04,385
Have you told her?

383
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,720
I wanted to tell you first,
man-to-man

384
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:09,723
rather than go
behind your back.

385
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:14,995
Let me speak
with her in private.

386
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,331
You'll never be alone
with her again.

387
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:56,603
Why did the usurper
pardon you?

388
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:01,275
If we could
speak alone.

389
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:03,711
No, speak to me here.

390
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:06,246
Explain it to me.

391
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:08,382
Who do you think
sent this to Meereen?

392
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,217
Who profits?

393
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:12,386
This is the work
of Tywin Lannister.

394
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,221
He wants to divide us.

395
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:16,924
If we're fighting each other,
we're not fighting him.

396
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,927
The pardon was signed
the year we met.

397
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,330
Why were you pardoned?

398
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,733
Unless you're saying
this document was forged.

399
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:30,137
It is not forged.

400
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:32,172
Why, then?

401
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,941
I sent letters to Varys,

402
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:36,176
the spymaster
of King's Landing.

403
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:38,645
What was the content
of these letters?

404
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,081
- Information.
- What information?

405
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:44,051
When you and Viserys
arrived in Pentos.

406
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:46,553
His plan to marry you
to Khal Drogo.

407
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:48,856
<i>When you were married.</i>

408
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,624
When your brother died.

409
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:53,127
You told him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

410
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,762
- I--
- Yes or no?

411
00:29:54,796 --> 00:29:56,096
- Khaleesi.
- <i>Don't call me that.</i>

412
00:29:56,131 --> 00:29:59,433
Did you tell him I was
carrying Drogo's child?

413
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:03,570
Yes.

414
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:08,408
That wine merchant
tried to poison me

415
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,010
because of
your information.

416
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:11,845
I stopped you
from drinking his wine.

417
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,814
Because you knew
it was poisoned.

418
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:16,183
I suspected.

419
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:18,619
You betrayed me

420
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:20,821
from the first.

421
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:23,690
Forgive me.

422
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,926
I never meant--

423
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,262
please, Khaleesi,
forgive me.

424
00:30:28,296 --> 00:30:30,998
You sold my secrets to
the man who killed my father

425
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:33,000
- and stole my brother's throne...
- I have protected you.

426
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:34,401
Fought for you.
Killed for you.

427
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:36,003
...and you want me
to forgive you?

428
00:30:38,106 --> 00:30:39,940
I have loved you.

429
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:41,909
Love?

430
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:44,745
Love? How can you
say that to me?

431
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,781
<i>Any other man, and I would</i>
<i>have you executed.</i>

432
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:51,051
But you, I do not want you
in my city dead or alive.

433
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:54,488
Go back to your masters
in King's Landing.

434
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:57,057
Collect your pardon
if you can.

435
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:01,795
Daenerys, please.

436
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,365
Don't ever presume
to touch me again

437
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,800
or speak my name.

438
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:08,569
You have until dusk
to collect your things

439
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:09,970
and leave this city.

440
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:12,940
<i>If you're found in Meereen</i>
<i>past break of day,</i>

441
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:15,609
I'll have your head
thrown into Slaver's Bay.

442
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:19,780
Go.

443
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:23,183
Now.

444
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:21,241
Moat Cailin
is yours, Father.

445
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:30,384
Walk with me.

446
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:31,952
Has there been
any word from Locke?

447
00:32:31,986 --> 00:32:34,087
No.

448
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:35,389
Unimportant.

449
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:37,424
A cripple,
a young boy.

450
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:40,494
None of the northern
lords have seen them.

451
00:32:40,528 --> 00:32:43,497
Dead most likely.

452
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,235
Most of the ironborn
have fled the North.

453
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:52,239
Now more will follow,
thanks to you.

454
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:56,877
Tell me what you see.

455
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,917
Moors, fields, hills.

456
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:06,887
Tell me what you see.

457
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,327
Nothing.

458
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,895
Not nothing.

459
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:17,331
The North.

460
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:20,133
Ride 700 miles that way,
you're still in the North.

461
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:23,003
400 miles that way.

462
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:25,072
300 miles that way.

463
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:29,009
The North is larger
than the other six kingdoms combined.

464
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:30,877
And I am the Warden
of the North.

465
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:33,447
The North is mine.

466
00:33:35,216 --> 00:33:37,684
Now tell me,
what is your name?

467
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:43,623
Ramsay Snow.

468
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,792
No, not Ramsay Snow.

469
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:48,762
Open it.

470
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,932
From this day
until your last day,

471
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:53,667
you are Ramsay Bolton,

472
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,603
son of Roose Bolton,
Warden of the North.

473
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:05,012
You honor me.

474
00:34:05,046 --> 00:34:08,048
I swear I will
uphold your name

475
00:34:08,082 --> 00:34:10,050
and your tradition.

476
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:12,452
I will be worthy
of you, Father,

477
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:14,888
I promise.

478
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:36,977
Come, Reek,
I'll be needing a bath.

479
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,607
Yes?

480
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:23,423
<i>First time I saw you,</i>
<i>you were just a child.</i>

481
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,693
<i>A girl from the North</i>
<i>come to the capital for the first time.</i>

482
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:29,429
Not a child any longer.

483
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,935
Why did you help me?

484
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:37,337
They would have thrown you
through the Moon Door

485
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,039
if they found
you guilty.

486
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:41,608
<i>That's not an answer.</i>

487
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:46,346
If they'd have
executed you,

488
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,848
what would they
have done with me?

489
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,218
I don't know.

490
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:53,720
Neither do I.

491
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,890
Better to gamble
on the man you know

492
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,658
than the strangers
you don't?

493
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,696
And you think
you know me?

494
00:36:04,332 --> 00:36:06,099
I know what you want.

495
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:08,001
<i>Do you?</i>

496
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:25,152
I thought
it'd make me happy,

497
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:27,154
but it doesn't.
Not really.

498
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:29,222
Nothing makes
you happy.

499
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:30,857
- Lots of things
make me happy.- Like what?

500
00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:32,926
Killing Polliver,
killing Rorge.

501
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,163
So you're sad because
you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself.

502
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:37,464
Is that it?

503
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:39,065
At least I could
have been there to watch.

504
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,102
I wanted to see the look in his eyes
when he knew it was over.

505
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:45,505
Aye, nothing in the world
beats that look.

506
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,074
You protected him
for most of his life.

507
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:49,476
You think you
could have saved him?

508
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,546
I wasn't the damn
wine taster.

509
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:58,852
Little shit deserved
to die, but poison--

510
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:01,721
poison's a woman's weapon.

511
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:03,623
Men kill with steel.

512
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:05,125
That's your stupid
pride talking.

513
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:07,494
It's why you'll never
be a great killer.

514
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:10,330
I'd have killed Joffrey with
a chicken bone if I had to.

515
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:14,868
I'd pay good money
to see that.

516
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:20,640
You should have
let me burn it.

517
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,176
It's a fleabite.

518
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:26,646
That fleabite's got you walking
a lot slower than you used to.

519
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:29,983
Well, we won't
have to walk too much further.

520
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:31,952
You really think my aunt
will pay for me?

521
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,553
Aye, she'll pay.

522
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:34,955
I've never even
met her.

523
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:38,391
Doesn't matter.
You're her blood.

524
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:43,029
Family, honor,
all that horseshit.

525
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:45,632
It's all you lords
and ladies ever talk about.

526
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,834
I'm not a lady.

527
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:51,104
Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?

528
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:54,474
The bloody Hound,
Sandor Clegane.

529
00:37:54,508 --> 00:37:56,776
And his...

530
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,813
traveling companion
Arya Stark,

531
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,816
<i>niece of your lady</i>
<i>Lysa Arryn.</i>

532
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,719
Then I offer
my condolences.

533
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:08,054
Lady Arryn died.

534
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:13,326
Three days ago.

535
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:33,480
I've never left home
before, Uncle Petyr.

536
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:35,649
- I'm afraid to leave.
- You shouldn't be.

537
00:38:35,683 --> 00:38:38,752
The Lord of the Vale
belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.

538
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:41,288
She said it's not
safe outside.

539
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:43,056
It wasn't safe
for her inside.

540
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,860
People die
at their dinner tables.

541
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:48,995
They die in their beds.

542
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,432
They die squatting
over their chamber pots.

543
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:54,868
Everybody dies
sooner or later.

544
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,736
Don't worry
about your death.

545
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:59,472
Worry about your life.

546
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,875
Take charge of your life

547
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:04,344
for as long as it lasts.

548
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:07,314
That is what it means
to be Lord of the Vale.

549
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:33,340
Shall we go?

550
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:43,016
Wine always helps.

551
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:47,120
I thank you
for it.

552
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:50,490
Trial by combat.

553
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:54,961
Deciding a man's guilt
or innocence

554
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:57,197
in the eyes of the gods

555
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,833
by having two other men
hack each other to pieces.

556
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:02,635
Tells you something
about the gods.

557
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:06,706
How much longer?

558
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:09,042
Soon.

559
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,214
Do you think
Oberyn has a chance?

560
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:19,185
The Red Viper of Dorne.

561
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,421
You don't get a name
like that unless you're deadly, right?

562
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:22,856
<i>I've never</i>
<i>seen him fight.</i>

563
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:25,625
Oh, he's going to die.
I'm going to die.

564
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:26,960
Oberyn believes in himself.

565
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:29,062
That's putting it mildly.

566
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:32,265
What's the punishment
for regicide?

567
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:35,101
Drawing and quartering?
Hanging?

568
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:37,470
- <i>Breaking at the wheel?</i>
- Beheading.

569
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,239
<i>Seems rather</i>
<i>ordinary.</i>

570
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:41,775
<i>And he was my nephew</i>
<i>as well, so what is that?</i>

571
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,343
Fratricide is brothers.

572
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:45,545
Filicide is sons.

573
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,115
Nepoticide.
That's the one.

574
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:54,254
Matricide, patricide,

575
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:57,157
infanticide, suicide.

576
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:01,127
There's no kind of killing that
doesn't have its own word.

577
00:41:01,162 --> 00:41:03,029
Cousins.

578
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:05,131
<i>Cousins, you're right.</i>

579
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,900
There is no word
for cousin killing.

580
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,735
Well done.

581
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:11,805
Do you remember cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?

582
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,474
Of course.

583
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:14,174
Wet-nurse dropped
him on his head.

584
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:16,776
- Left him simple.
- <i>Simple?</i>

585
00:41:16,811 --> 00:41:18,845
Used to sit all day
in the garden.

586
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:20,647
Crushing beetles
with a rock.

587
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,586
Nothing made him happier.

588
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,954
Nothing made you happier.

589
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:29,856
You'd think being
tormented from birth

590
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,058
would have given you some
affinity for the afflicted.

591
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:33,028
On the contrary.

592
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:35,260
Laughing at another
person's misery

593
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:37,297
was the only thing that made me
feel like everyone else.

594
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,199
The joke wore thin, though.

595
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:41,134
<i>For you.</i>
<i>You drifted away.</i>

596
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,836
I had other interests.

597
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,871
Yes, other interests.

598
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:48,775
But I stayed with Orson.

599
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,743
<i>Why?</i>

600
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:52,212
I was curious.

601
00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:54,614
Why was he smashing
all those beetles?

602
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:56,182
What did he
get out of it?

603
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:58,318
<i>First thing I did</i>
<i>was ask him.</i>

604
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:02,088
"Orson, why are you smashing
all those beetles?"

605
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:05,158
He gave me an answer.
"Smash the beetles.

606
00:42:05,192 --> 00:42:08,127
Smash 'em."

607
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,897
<i>I wasn't deterred.</i>

608
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,632
I was the smartest
person I knew.

609
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,201
Certainly I had the wherewithal to
unravel the mysteries

610
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:16,903
that lay at the heart
of a moron.

611
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:20,507
So I went to
Maester Volarik's library.

612
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,709
Volarik.
Tried to touch me once.

613
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:25,245
Turns out, far too much has been
written about great men

614
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:27,447
and not nearly enough
about morons.

615
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:29,782
Doesn't seem right.

616
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:31,751
In any case,
I found nothing

617
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:33,786
that illuminated the nature
of Orson's affliction

618
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:36,623
or the reason behind his
relentless beetle slaughter.

619
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:38,992
<i>So I went back</i>
<i>to the source.</i>

620
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,194
<i>I may not have been able</i>
<i>to speak with Orson,</i>

621
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,863
but I could observe him,
watch him

622
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:46,132
the way men
watch animals

623
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:49,035
to come to a deeper understanding
of their behavior.

624
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:53,239
And as I watched,

625
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:55,775
I became more and more
sure of it.

626
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:58,444
There was something
happening there.

627
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:01,714
His face was like
the page of a book

628
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,683
written in a language
I didn't understand.

629
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:06,553
But he wasn't mindless.
He had his reasons.

630
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:09,856
<i>And I became possessed</i>
<i>with knowing what they were.</i>

631
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,426
I began to spend inordinate
amounts of time watching him.

632
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,095
I would eat my lunch
in the garden,

633
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,231
chewing my mutton
to the music of...

634
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:22,835
And when I wasn't watching him,
I was thinking about him.

635
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,638
Father droned on about
the family legacy

636
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:27,407
<i>and I thought about</i>
<i>Orson's beetles.</i>

637
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:30,310
I read the histories
of Targaryen conquests.

638
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:32,545
Did I hear dragon wings?
No.

639
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,548
I heard...

640
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:39,319
<i>And I still couldn't figure</i>
<i>out why he was doing it.</i>

641
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:41,654
And I had to know,
because it was horrible

642
00:43:41,689 --> 00:43:45,058
that all these beetles
should be dying for no reason.

643
00:43:45,092 --> 00:43:46,626
Every day around the world,

644
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,063
men, women, and children
are murdered by the score.

645
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:52,899
Who gives a dusty fuck
about a bunch of beetles?

646
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:55,735
I know, I know.
But still, it filled me with dread.

647
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:59,305
Piles and piles of them,
years and years of them.

648
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,174
How many countless living
crawling things

649
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:04,177
smashed and dried out
and returned to the dirt?

650
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:06,613
In my dreams I found myself

651
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,115
standing on a beach
made of beetle husks

652
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,184
stretching as far
as the eye could see.

653
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,386
I woke up crying,

654
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,788
weeping for their
shattered little bodies.

655
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:18,157
I tried to stop
Orson once.

656
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:19,592
He was twice your size.

657
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:21,361
He just pushed me
aside with a "kuuh"

658
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:23,963
and kept on smashing.

659
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:26,499
Every day until
that mule

660
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,534
kicked him in the chest
and killed him.

661
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,781
So what do you think?

662
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:44,250
Why did he do it?

663
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:46,619
What was it all about?

664
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,392
I don't know.

665
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:12,845
Good luck today.

666
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:47,346
Looks like
very light armor.

667
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:48,748
I like to move around.

668
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:50,683
You could at least
wear a helmet.

669
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:54,487
You shouldn't drink
before a fight.

670
00:45:54,521 --> 00:45:56,723
You learn this during your years
in the fighting pits?

671
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:59,058
I always drink
before a fight.

672
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:01,527
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.

673
00:46:01,562 --> 00:46:04,530
Today is not
the day I die.

674
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:13,539
You're going
to fight that?

675
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:16,109
I'm going
to kill that.

676
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:22,148
He is the biggest man
I've ever seen.

677
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:24,917
Size does not matter
when you are flat on your back.

678
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:26,252
Thank the gods.

679
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,924
In the sight of gods
and men,

680
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,160
we gather to ascertain

681
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:36,963
the guilt or innocence
of this...

682
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:41,134
<i>man Tyrion Lannister.</i>

683
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:43,336
<i>May the Mother grant</i>
<i>them mercy.</i>

684
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,540
May the Father give them
such justice as they deserve.

685
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:50,276
And may the Warrior
guide the hand...

686
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,446
...of our champion--

687
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:03,589
Don't leave me
alone in this world.

688
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:05,525
Never.

689
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:27,647
Have they told you
who I am?

690
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,348
Some dead man.

691
00:47:34,321 --> 00:47:37,056
I am the brother
of Elia Martell.

692
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,159
Do you know why I have come
all the way to this stinking

693
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:42,428
shit-pile of a city?

694
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:44,297
For you.

695
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:51,771
I'm going to hear you
confess before you die.

696
00:47:51,805 --> 00:47:53,806
You raped my sister.

697
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:55,241
You murdered her.

698
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,043
You killed her children.

699
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:59,812
Say it now and we can
make this quick.

700
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:10,957
Say it.
You raped her.

701
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,760
You murdered her.

702
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:18,831
You killed her children.

703
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,677
You raped her!

704
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:32,912
You murdered her!

705
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:34,981
You killed her children!

706
00:49:14,187 --> 00:49:15,788
You raped her!

707
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,523
You murdered her!

708
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:29,835
You kill
her children!

709
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:39,045
Wait.
Are you dying?

710
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:40,813
No, no, no.

711
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:43,916
You can't die yet.
You haven't confessed.

712
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:48,654
Say it.

713
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:52,391
Say her name.
Elia Martell.

714
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:54,660
You raped her.
You killed her children.

715
00:49:54,695 --> 00:49:57,229
Elia Martell.

716
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:58,965
Who gave you the order?

717
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,567
Who gave you
the order?!

718
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,903
Say her name!

719
00:50:03,937 --> 00:50:06,005
You raped her!
You murdered her!

720
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,240
<i>You killed her children.</i>

721
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:10,876
Say it.
Say her name.

722
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:14,447
Say it!

723
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:22,788
Elia Martell.

724
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:26,892
I killed her
children.

725
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:29,362
Then I raped her.

726
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:32,531
Then I smashed her head
in like this!

727
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,347
The gods have made
their will known.

728
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,517
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

729
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:54,220
<i>in the name of King Tommen</i>
<i>of the House Baratheon,</i>

730
00:50:54,254 --> 00:50:56,455
<i>First of His Name,</i>

731
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,524
you are hereby
sentenced to death.
