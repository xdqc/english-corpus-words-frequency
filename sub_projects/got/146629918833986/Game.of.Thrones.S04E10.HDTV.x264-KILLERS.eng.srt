5
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,931
You're wearing
a black cloak again.

6
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:23,801
I've been sent
to negotiate with you.

7
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:55,165
It appears my trusting
nature got the better of me.

8
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,434
It's happened before.

9
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,190
I was hoping your loyalty
was real

10
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:01,215
when you pledged
yourself to us, Jon Snow.

11
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,073
Truly I was.

12
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:04,942
The Halfhand ordered me
to join your army

13
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,745
and bring back whatever
information I could to Castle Black.

14
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,247
He made me kill him
so you'd trust me.

15
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:11,849
I was loyal...

16
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:14,518
to him and to my
Night's Watch vows.

17
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:16,487
All your vows?

18
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,259
She wasn't enough
to turn you, eh?

19
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,428
Were you enough
to turn her?

20
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:27,231
She put three
arrows in me

21
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:29,333
when I escaped.

22
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,937
Did you see her
again at Castle Black?

23
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:36,173
- Yes.
- And?

24
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:38,375
She's dead.

25
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:42,746
- Your doing?
- No.

26
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:46,283
We'll drink to her.

27
00:05:09,674 --> 00:05:11,842
Of all the ways
I'd kill you,

28
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,278
poison would be
the last.

29
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,683
- Ygritte.
- Ygritte.

30
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,394
That's not wine.

31
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:33,464
No, it's a proper
northern drink, Jon Snow.

32
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:36,700
You did well.
Fought hard.

33
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,802
Killed some of
our strongest men.

34
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:41,572
One of our giants
went into your tunnel

35
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:43,874
and never
came out again.

36
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,843
Mag the Mighty.

37
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,711
He's dead.

38
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,880
He killed
my friend Grenn.

39
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,281
He was their king.

40
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,951
The last of a bloodline
that stretches back

41
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,053
before the First Men.

42
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:57,988
Grenn came from a farm.

43
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:05,162
- Mag and Grenn.
- Grenn and Mag.

44
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:10,534
Kullback, could I trouble
you for something to eat?

45
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,470
I don't imagine our guest
has eaten anything

46
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:15,339
for quite some time.

47
00:06:16,574 --> 00:06:20,644
So, you're here
to strike a bargain?

48
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:24,415
Turn your army around
and go home.

49
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,684
You know I know
you're low on arrows,

50
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:28,752
you're low on oil,
you're low on men.

51
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:30,654
How many are left, 50?

52
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,690
I told Tormund and Orell.

53
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,458
We have more
than 1,000 men.

54
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,260
I showed you
everything I had.

55
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:37,759
The whole army,
100,000 strong.

56
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,561
And what did you do?

57
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:40,971
You fired on us with
everything you had.

58
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,068
It wasn't much.
As soon as I saw that,

59
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:47,404
I sent 400 men
to climb the Wall,

60
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,807
an unmanned stretch
five miles west of here.

61
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,742
A lot of them
will die climbing,

62
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,777
but most of them will be
over by the end of the day.

63
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:57,047
<i>It's me being honest</i>
<i>with you, Jon Snow,</i>

64
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,583
<i>which is more than</i>
<i>you've ever done for me.</i>

65
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:01,418
My people
have bled enough.

66
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:03,253
We're not here
to conquer.

67
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,290
We're here to hide
behind your Wall.

68
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:10,561
Just like you.
We need your tunnel.

69
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:13,797
Now we both know
that winter is coming.

70
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:17,434
And if my people aren't south
of the Wall when it comes in earnest,

71
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,403
we'll all end up
worse than dead.

72
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:22,306
You want to strike
a bargain with me?

73
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,807
Here's the bargain.

74
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:26,276
You go back,
you open the gates to us,

75
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:29,613
and I swear to you
that no one else will die.

76
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:31,949
Refuse,

77
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,818
and we'll kill every
last man at Castle Black.

78
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:38,188
Ah!

79
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:45,229
Oh, that's why
you're here.

80
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:48,899
I reckon you could do it before
any of them could stop you.

81
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,901
They'd kill you,
of course.

82
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:52,169
They'd kill you slow.

83
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:55,472
But you knew that
when you came in here.

84
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,710
Are you capable
of that, Jon Snow?

85
00:07:59,744 --> 00:08:03,647
Killing a man in his own tent
when he's just offered you peace?

86
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,682
Is that what
the Night's Watch is?

87
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:08,118
Is that what you are?

88
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:14,291
<i>Riders coming!</i>

89
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,959
- Are you attacking us?
- No.

90
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:17,961
It's like you said,
we don't have the men.

91
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,991
Hold! To me!
To me!

92
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:02,366
Stand down!

93
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,136
I said my people
have bled enough

94
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,505
and I meant it.

95
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,441
<i>Round them up.</i>

96
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:46,143
<i>Stay with the horses.</i>

97
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:58,021
You're the
King-beyond-the-Wall?

98
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,293
- Do you know who I am?
- Never had the pleasure.

99
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:04,728
This is Stannis Baratheon,

100
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:06,530
the one true king
of the Seven Kingdoms.

101
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:09,466
We're not in the Seven Kingdoms and
you're not dressed for this weather.

102
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:14,037
It is customary to kneel
when surrendering to a king.

103
00:11:20,378 --> 00:11:22,279
We do not kneel.

104
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:24,815
I'll have thousands of your men
in chains by nightfall,

105
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,050
have nowhere to put them,
have nothing to feed them.

106
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:30,053
I'm not here
to slaughter beat dogs.

107
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:33,390
Their fate
depends on their king.

108
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:37,394
All the same,
we do not kneel.

109
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,666
Take these men away.

110
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,435
What's a man of the Night's Watch
doing in a wildling camp?

111
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,207
I was sent to discuss terms with the
King-beyond-the-Wall.

112
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,881
You're speaking
to the one true king, boy.

113
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,411
You will address him
as Your Grace.

114
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:57,748
I know he's the king.
My father died for him.

115
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,452
My name is Jon Snow,
Your Grace.

116
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:04,821
I'm Ned Stark's son.

117
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,826
Your father
was an honorable man.

118
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,762
He was, Your Grace.

119
00:12:11,796 --> 00:12:13,897
What do you think
he'd have done with him?

120
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:22,072
I was this man's
prisoner once.

121
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:25,342
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.

122
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:28,979
<i>But he spared my life.</i>

123
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:31,214
I think my father would
have taken him prisoner,

124
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,316
listened to what
he had to say.

125
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:38,989
Very well, then.
Take him.

126
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,330
Your Grace.

127
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,133
<i>If my father had seen</i>
<i>the things that I've seen,</i>

128
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:53,537
he'd also tell you to burn the dead
before nightfall.

129
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,573
All of them.

130
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:07,951
I would suggest
milk of the poppy

131
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,620
to ease his pain,
but he is completely insensate.

132
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,055
Bloody Martells.

133
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,124
The cause appears
to be manticore venom.

134
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:16,460
It is.
The Death's Head manticore.

135
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:20,130
Yes, I've read
a great deal about it.

136
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,099
It's a horrible poison.

137
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,835
Usually Mantari
in origin.

138
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,736
Oh! Yes, yes.

139
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,271
There's nothing
to be done.

140
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:29,739
Yes, there is.

141
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:34,144
May I ask what you
think you're doing?

142
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:35,545
Saving him.

143
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,514
Your Grace, I wish
it were otherwise,

144
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:39,950
but Ser Gregor
is beyond saving.

145
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,519
Well, well beyond.

146
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:45,122
This man is not
even a maester,

147
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,990
let alone Grand Maester.

148
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,725
That's for the best.

149
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,127
No maester knows
how to save him.

150
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,262
That is exactly
the sort of arrogance

151
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:55,265
that had him expelled from
the Citadel, Your Grace.

152
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:59,169
His curiosity was deemed
dangerous and unnatural.

153
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,404
Rightly so,
in my opinion.

154
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,007
You're dismissed,
Grand Maester.

155
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:09,546
But, Your Grace,
this is my laboratory.

156
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,349
- Not anymore.
<i>- But I--</i>

157
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,359
- You can save him?
- Difficult to say, Your Grace.

158
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:24,594
<i>But if my past work</i>
<i>is any guide...</i>

159
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,198
...we stand a chance.

160
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:30,800
Do everything you can.

161
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:32,502
Come to me
for anything you need.

162
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,037
Thank you,
Your Grace.

163
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:35,972
<i>You should know,</i>

164
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:39,075
the process
may change him...

165
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,179
somewhat.

166
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:46,316
Will it weaken him?

167
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,052
Oh, no.

168
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:51,221
Very well, then.

169
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:11,541
<i>Not another word.</i>

170
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,044
We've been over this.
The matter's closed.

171
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,147
I'm opening it again.

172
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:20,250
You were betrothed
to Loras Tyrell.

173
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:22,786
You're still betrothed
to Loras Tyrell.

174
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,921
And you will marry
Loras Tyrell

175
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:27,257
as soon as Tommen
marries Margaery.

176
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:28,658
I will not.

177
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,695
Jaime cannot marry
or inherit lands.

178
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:34,764
Tyrion's sentence
will be carried out tomorrow.

179
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:40,070
You have on several occasions
made great claims

180
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,772
about your commitment
to this family's future.

181
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,641
Your role in that future

182
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,843
is more vital now
than it ever was.

183
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:48,778
I don't care.

184
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:52,215
I will stay in King's Landing
where I belong with my son the king.

185
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,485
When you were nine years old,
I was called to the capital.

186
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,255
I decided to take your brother
with me and not you.

187
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,825
You insisted that you would not be
left at Casterly Rock

188
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,661
under any circumstances.
And if you recall--

189
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:06,796
I'm not interested in hearing
another one of your smug stories

190
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,999
about the time you won.

191
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,001
This isn't going to be
one of those times.

192
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,069
Do you think
you'll be the first person

193
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:16,172
dragged into a sept to be
married against her will?

194
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,174
When you marched into
the throne room to tell me

195
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:20,844
we'd won the Battle of Blackwater--
do you remember?

196
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:25,849
I was sitting on the Iron
Throne with Tommen.

197
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,550
I was about to give him
essence of nightshade.

198
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:29,505
That's how far I was willing to go
when I thought

199
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,255
someone awful had come
to take my son away.

200
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,693
Someone awful is coming
to take him away.

201
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,895
- No.
- Joffrey is dead.

202
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:41,331
Myrcella's been sold
like livestock.

203
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:44,334
And now you want to ship me off
to Highgarden and steal my boy.

204
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:46,770
My last boy.

205
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,838
Margaery will dig
her claws in,

206
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:51,274
you will dig your claws in
and you'll fight over him

207
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:53,476
like beasts
until you rip him apart.

208
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:57,247
I will burn our house to the ground
before I let that happen.

209
00:16:57,281 --> 00:17:00,317
And how will you do that?

210
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:03,320
I'll tell
everyone the truth.

211
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,488
<i>What truth</i>
<i>would that be?</i>

212
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:11,695
You don't know, do you?

213
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:16,266
You never believed it.

214
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,369
How is that possible?

215
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:23,440
What am I saying?
Of course it's possible.

216
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:27,243
How can someone so consumed
by the idea of his family

217
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:30,213
have any conception
what his actual family was doing?

218
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:34,584
We were right there
in front of you and you didn't see us.

219
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,753
One look
in the past 20 years,

220
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:39,756
one real look at your own children
and you would have known.

221
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,292
Known what?

222
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,728
Everything they say
is true.

223
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,363
- About Jaime and me.
- No.

224
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:49,165
- Your legacy is a lie.
- No, no, no, no.

225
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,068
I don't believe you.

226
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:57,240
Yes, you do.

227
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:17,060
Jaime.

228
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,329
You won.

229
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:22,132
One fewer brother.
Must be proud of yourself.

230
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,467
There's really nothing
you wouldn't do, is there?

231
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,236
For my family,
no, nothing.

232
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,638
I would do things for my family you
couldn't imagine.

233
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,174
- Tyrion is your family.
- He's not.

234
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,077
- You don't get to choose.
- I do. So do you.

235
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,447
You can choose the creature that killed
our mother to come into this world--

236
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:39,783
Are you really mad enough
to blame him for that?

237
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,685
<i>He didn't decide to kill her.</i>
<i>He was an infant.</i>

238
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,554
A disease doesn't decide
to kill you.

239
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:47,323
All the same, you cut it out
before it does.

240
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,326
What do you decide?
What do you choose?

241
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,861
The things I did
to get back to you,

242
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,798
to endure all that,
only to find you--

243
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,736
I choose you.

244
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,404
- Those are words.
- Yes.

245
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:03,740
Like the ones
I just said to Father.

246
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,476
I told him.

247
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,344
Told him what?

248
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:10,413
I told him about us.

249
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,116
You told him?

250
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,185
I told him I won't
marry Loras Tyrell.

251
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:18,888
I told him I'm staying
right here with Tommen, with you.

252
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,356
You think he'll
just accept that?

253
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,392
Go and ask him.

254
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:26,262
What did you say?

255
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:28,631
I don't want to talk
about Tywin Lannister.

256
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,267
I don't choose
Tywin Lannister.

257
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:33,069
I don't love
Tywin Lannister.

258
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:35,305
I love my brother.

259
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,273
I love my lover.

260
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:40,743
People will whisper,
they'll make their jokes.

261
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,145
Let them.

262
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,848
They're all so small,
I can't even see them.

263
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:47,116
I only see what matters.

264
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:57,460
Someone will walk in.

265
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,995
I don't care.

266
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:38,801
I can speak the common
tongue if you wish.

267
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,436
You speak it very well.

268
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:44,374
Before you freed me,
I belonged to Master Mighdal.

269
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,442
I was tutor
to his children.

270
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:48,478
<i>I taught them languages</i>
<i>and history.</i>

271
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:52,582
They know a great deal
about your family because of me.

272
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:55,718
<i>Little Calla</i>
<i>is only seven,</i>

273
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,121
but she admires you
very much.

274
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:00,924
I hope I can prove
worthy of her admiration.

275
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:03,293
What can I do for you?

276
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:07,163
When you took the city,
the children begged me

277
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,732
not to leave the house.

278
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:13,503
But Master Mighdal
and I agreed that I must.

279
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:16,372
So I lost my home.

280
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,310
Now I live on the streets.

281
00:21:20,344 --> 00:21:21,945
I have outfitted mess halls

282
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:24,447
to feed all former slaves
and barracks to shelter them.

283
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:27,183
I do not mean
to offend, Your Grace.

284
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:30,053
<i>I went to one</i>
<i>of these places.</i>

285
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,388
The young prey on the old.

286
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:35,959
Take what they want
and beat us if we resist.

287
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,294
My Unsullied will make them
safe again in short order,

288
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,063
my friend,
this I promise you.

289
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:43,866
Even if they are safe,
who would I be there?

290
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:46,636
What purpose
would I serve?

291
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:50,073
<i>With my master,</i>
<i>I was a teacher.</i>

292
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:53,943
I had the respect
and love of his children.

293
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:55,979
What is it
that you want from me?

294
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:59,015
Your Grace, I ask you

295
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,018
to let me sell myself
back to Master Mighdal.

296
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:04,587
You want to return
to a man who owned you

297
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,156
like a goat
or a chair?

298
00:22:07,191 --> 00:22:08,891
Please, Your Grace.

299
00:22:08,926 --> 00:22:11,894
The young may rejoice in the
new world you have built for them,

300
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,931
but for those of us
too old to change,

301
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:19,035
there is only fear
and squalor.

302
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:21,971
I am not alone.

303
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:25,608
There are many outside waiting
to beg the same of you.

304
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,543
I did not take
this city to preside

305
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:30,013
over the injustice
I fought to destroy.

306
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:33,716
I took it to bring
people freedom.

307
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:37,186
But freedom means making
your own choices.

308
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:41,124
I will allow you to sign a contract
with your former master.

309
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:44,661
It may not cover a period
lasting longer than a year.

310
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:47,030
Thank you, Your Grace.

311
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,533
Thank you.

312
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:58,374
The masters will take advantage
of this situation.

313
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,678
The men serving them

314
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:04,313
will be slaves
in all but name.

315
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,322
Approach, my friend.

316
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>I have brought you--</i>

317
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,722
He came from the sky.

318
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,726
<i>The black one.</i>

319
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,364
The winged shadow.

320
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:59,068
<i>He came from</i>
<i>the sky and...</i>

321
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,676
<i>My girl.</i>

322
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,344
My little girl.

323
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:14,650
<i>What was her name?</i>

324
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:16,719
<i>Zala, Your Grace.</i>

325
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:19,922
- How old was she?
- Three.

326
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:22,125
Three.

327
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:14,597
<i>They came to us from White</i>
<i>Harbor and Barrowton,</i>

328
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:18,334
from Fairmarket
and King's Landing,

329
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:20,903
from north and south,

330
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:23,372
from east and west.

331
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:28,611
They died protecting
men, women, and children

332
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:31,213
who will never know
their names.

333
00:27:31,248 --> 00:27:33,816
<i>It is for us</i>
<i>to remember them.</i>

334
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,284
<i>Our brothers,</i>

335
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,487
<i>we shall never see</i>
<i>their like again.</i>

336
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:41,824
And now their watch
is ended.

337
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:46,262
And now their watch
is ended.

338
00:28:57,401 --> 00:29:00,703
Your old blind man
patched me up.

339
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:02,338
<i>Why?</i>

340
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:05,508
He's sworn to treat all
wounded men, friend or foe.

341
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,910
You want me alive
so you can torture me?

342
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:09,211
No one's gonna torture you.

343
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:13,049
So how do we die?
Hanging? Beheading?

344
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,051
<i>Drop us from the top</i>
<i>of the Wall?</i>

345
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:17,219
I don't know what happens
to the prisoners.

346
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:19,188
Who decides?

347
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:21,724
I suppose Stannis does.

348
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:23,993
He your king now?

349
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:26,429
I don't have a king.

350
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:30,966
You spent too much
time with us, Jon Snow.

351
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:34,603
You can never be
a kneeler again.

352
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:37,173
We're gonna burn
the bodies of your dead.

353
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:40,743
Do you want to say
any words over them?

354
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:43,145
Words?
What kind of words?

355
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,482
Funeral words. I don't know how
the free folk do it.

356
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:48,117
<i>Do what?</i>

357
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:49,852
Say farewell.

358
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:53,522
The dead can't
hear us, boy.

359
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:00,029
Snow.

360
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,202
Did you love her?

361
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:11,006
She loved you.

362
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,342
She told you?

363
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,610
<i>No.</i>

364
00:30:14,644 --> 00:30:17,746
All she ever talked about
was killing you.

365
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:20,049
<i>That's how I know.</i>

366
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:25,254
She belongs
in the North.

367
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:28,224
<i>The real North.</i>

368
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,027
You understand me?

369
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,534
We can stop.
We can rest.

370
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:20,636
We'll rest with
the three-eyed raven.

371
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:33,582
We're not
going to make it.

372
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,588
We're already here.

373
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,590
<i>Jojen.</i>

374
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,526
<i>Jojen.</i>

375
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,762
Look, Jojen.
Look.

376
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,579
Jojen!
Come on!

377
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,981
Help them!
Now!

378
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:14,717
<i>Hold on to me!</i>

379
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:21,824
Hang on!

380
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:23,959
- Hodor.
- Help them!

381
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:25,861
Hodor.

382
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,067
Hodor!

383
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:48,150
Hodor!

384
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:11,974
Hodor.

385
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:13,909
Hodor!

386
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:47,443
<i>Bran!</i>

387
00:35:50,146 --> 00:35:52,181
Save yourself, now!

388
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,641
<i>Come with me,</i>
<i>Brandon Stark.</i>

389
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:29,251
He is lost.

390
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:31,186
Come with me
or die with him.

391
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:33,922
Go with them.

392
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:38,954
<i>They cannot follow us.</i>

393
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:41,290
The power that moves them
is powerless here.

394
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,659
Who are you?

395
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:46,161
The First Men
called us the children,

396
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:49,097
but we were born
long before them.

397
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:51,667
Come, he waits for you.

398
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,687
You're the three-eyed raven?

399
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:25,027
I've been many things.

400
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:28,630
Now I am what you see.

401
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:33,568
My brother, he led us to you
and now he--

402
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:35,737
He knew
what would happen.

403
00:39:35,772 --> 00:39:38,607
From the moment
he left,

404
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:41,643
he knew
and he went anyway.

405
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,211
How do you know?

406
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:45,180
I've been watching you.

407
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:47,449
All of you.

408
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,651
All of your lives.

409
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:52,354
With 1,000 eyes
and one.

410
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:56,958
<i>Now you've come</i>
<i>to me at last,</i>

411
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:59,494
Brandon Stark.

412
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:02,030
Though the hour is late.

413
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:05,233
I didn't want
anyone to die for me.

414
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:08,737
He died so you could find
what you have lost.

415
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,307
You're going to help
me walk again?

416
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:15,877
<i>You will never</i>
<i>walk again.</i>

417
00:40:17,613 --> 00:40:20,615
But you will fly.

418
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:38,266
Podrick.

419
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:40,402
Podrick.

420
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:42,738
Where are the horses?

421
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:45,640
I hobbled them
last night.

422
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:47,442
What sort of hobble?

423
00:40:47,477 --> 00:40:49,244
A figure eight
like you taught me.

424
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:51,613
If you did it
like I taught you,

425
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:52,981
then the horses
would be here.

426
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:54,516
Thieves, maybe?

427
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,985
It's at least 30 miles
to the Eyrie from here.

428
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,654
You're carrying
the saddlebags.

429
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,017
People coming.

430
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:33,622
You can shit later.
There's people coming.

431
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,492
Morning.

432
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:41,296
Morning.

433
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,633
I like your sword.

434
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:47,669
<i>Are we getting close</i>
<i>to the Bloody Gate?</i>

435
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:49,671
About 10 more miles.

436
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,540
Did you
hear that, Podrick?

437
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:54,142
Only 10 more miles
to the Bloody Gate.

438
00:41:55,678 --> 00:41:57,412
Are you a knight?

439
00:41:57,446 --> 00:41:59,414
No.

440
00:41:59,448 --> 00:42:01,683
But you know how
to use that sword?

441
00:42:01,717 --> 00:42:04,419
I do.

442
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:06,454
Does it have a name?

443
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:08,824
Oathkeeper.

444
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:10,625
Mine's Needle.

445
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,661
Good name.

446
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:16,565
Who taught you
how to fight?

447
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,434
My father.

448
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:22,504
Mine never wanted to.

449
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:26,474
Said fighting
was for boys.

450
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,510
Mine said the same.

451
00:42:28,544 --> 00:42:30,779
But I kept fighting
the boys anyway.

452
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:32,948
<i>Kept losing.</i>

453
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:35,584
Finally my father said,
"If you're going to do it,

454
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:37,419
you might as well
do it right."

455
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:42,991
Seven blessings.

456
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:45,527
I'm Brienne of Tarth.
This is Podrick Payne.

457
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,798
You want something?

458
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:53,101
That's Sandor Clegane.
The Hound.

459
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:06,181
You're Arya Stark.

460
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:09,517
I asked if you
wanted something.

461
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:12,120
I swore to your mother
I would bring you home to her.

462
00:43:13,356 --> 00:43:14,589
My mother's dead.

463
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:16,191
<i>I know.</i>

464
00:43:16,225 --> 00:43:19,361
I wish I could have
been there to protect her.

465
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,063
You're not a northerner.

466
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:25,967
No, but I swore a sacred
vow to protect her.

467
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:28,036
Why didn't you?

468
00:43:31,507 --> 00:43:34,643
She commanded me to bring
Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.

469
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:36,411
You're paid
by the Lannisters.

470
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:39,080
<i>You're here</i>
<i>for the bounty on me.</i>

471
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:41,850
I'm not paid
by the Lannisters.

472
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:43,718
No?

473
00:43:45,087 --> 00:43:46,888
Fancy sword
you've got there.

474
00:43:46,923 --> 00:43:48,723
Where'd you get it?

475
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:54,162
I've been looking
at Lannister gold all my life.

476
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:58,333
Go on, Brienne
of fucking Tarth.

477
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,969
Tell me that's not
Lannister gold.

478
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:05,040
Jaime Lannister
gave me this sword.

479
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:06,875
The Bloody Gate
is 10 miles.

480
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:08,710
I swore to your mother
by the old gods--

481
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:10,011
I don't care
what you swore.

482
00:44:10,046 --> 00:44:11,746
- Arya!
<i>- You heard the girl.</i>

483
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:14,749
- She's not coming with you.
- She is.

484
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,720
You're not
a good listener.

485
00:44:18,754 --> 00:44:20,822
That Valyrian steel?

486
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:22,924
I always wanted
some Valyrian steel.

487
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,794
Come with me, Arya.
I'll take you to safety.

488
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:28,296
Safety?
Where the fuck's that?

489
00:44:28,331 --> 00:44:30,899
Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.
Her mother's dead.

490
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:32,934
Her father's dead.
Her brother's dead.

491
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:35,103
Winterfell is a pile
of rubble.

492
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:37,472
There is no safety,
you dumb bitch.

493
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:40,275
You don't know
that by now,

494
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:42,911
you're the wrong one
to watch over her.

495
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:44,913
And that's what
you're doing?

496
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:47,048
Watching over her?

497
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,985
Aye, that's what
I'm doing.

498
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,321
I have no wish
to kill you, Ser.

499
00:46:13,602 --> 00:46:15,336
I'm not a knight.

500
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:34,616
Arya!

501
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:36,885
Arya!

502
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,954
Arya!

503
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,324
- Where is she?
<i>- She was just here.</i>

504
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,759
Why weren't you
watching her?

505
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:46,954
I was watching you.
I thought you might need some help.

506
00:47:46,962 --> 00:47:48,897
Which way, Pod?
Which way did she go?

507
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:50,765
I think that way.

508
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:52,700
<i>Arya!</i>

509
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:54,802
<i>Arya!</i>

510
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:25,433
You still here?

511
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:37,045
Big bitch saved you.

512
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,214
I don't need saving.

513
00:48:39,248 --> 00:48:41,983
No, not you.
You're a real killer.

514
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:44,219
With your water dancing

515
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:46,254
and your Needle.

516
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,390
You gonna die?

517
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:52,193
Unless there's a maester
hiding behind that rock,

518
00:48:52,228 --> 00:48:54,329
aye,

519
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:56,764
I'm done.

520
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:03,404
I'd skin you alive
for wine.

521
00:49:04,373 --> 00:49:06,507
Fuck water.

522
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:10,044
Killed by a woman.

523
00:49:11,847 --> 00:49:14,415
I bet you like that.

524
00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:18,019
Go on,

525
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:20,088
go after her.

526
00:49:20,155 --> 00:49:22,590
<i>She'll help you.</i>

527
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:27,895
Going it alone,

528
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,431
<i>you won't last</i>
<i>a day out there.</i>

529
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:33,368
I'll last
longer than you.

530
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:42,710
You remember where
the heart is?

531
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:51,819
Fuck it.

532
00:49:51,854 --> 00:49:53,688
I'm ready.

533
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,259
Go on, girl.

534
00:49:58,294 --> 00:50:00,528
Another name
off your list.

535
00:50:01,697 --> 00:50:03,865
You kept
promising me.

536
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:12,973
I cut down
your butcher's boy.

537
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:14,909
The ginger.

538
00:50:16,378 --> 00:50:18,679
He was begging
for mercy.

539
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:22,016
"Please, Ser.
Please don't kill me.

540
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,984
Please, please."

541
00:50:25,554 --> 00:50:28,022
<i>Bled all over</i>
<i>my horse.</i>

542
00:50:28,056 --> 00:50:31,125
<i>Saddle stunk of butcher's boy</i>
<i>for weeks.</i>

543
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:35,596
And your sister.

544
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:38,999
Your pretty sister.

545
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:42,803
<i>I should have taken her.</i>

546
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:45,606
That night
the Blackwater burned.

547
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:49,343
I should have
fucked her bloody.

548
00:50:50,779 --> 00:50:53,414
<i>At least I'd have</i>
<i>one happy memory.</i>

549
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:05,526
Do I have to beg you?

550
00:51:10,165 --> 00:51:12,132
Do it.

551
00:51:16,805 --> 00:51:18,772
Do it.

552
00:51:21,943 --> 00:51:23,811
Do it.

553
00:51:53,508 --> 00:51:55,709
Kill me.

554
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,382
Kill me!

555
00:52:02,717 --> 00:52:05,252
Kill me!

556
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:07,955
Kill me!

557
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:20,901
Oh, get on with it,
you son of a whore.

558
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:23,137
Is that any way to speak
about our mother?

559
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:25,072
What are you doing?

560
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:26,807
What do you
think I'm doing?

561
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:28,842
A galley's waiting in the bay
bound for the Free Cities.

562
00:52:28,877 --> 00:52:30,177
- Who's helping you?
- Varys.

563
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:32,413
- Varys?
- You have more friends than you thought.

564
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:45,793
There's a locked door
at the top of the stairs.

565
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:48,495
Knock on it twice,
then twice again.

566
00:52:49,597 --> 00:52:51,398
Varys will open.

567
00:52:51,433 --> 00:52:54,335
I suppose this
is good-bye, then.

568
00:53:09,384 --> 00:53:11,518
Farewell, little brother.

569
00:53:12,954 --> 00:53:16,256
Jaime.

570
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:19,226
Thank you for my life.

571
00:53:21,863 --> 00:53:23,864
Quickly now.

572
00:54:43,278 --> 00:54:45,345
Tywin?

573
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,217
My lion.

574
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,964
I'm sorry.

575
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:25,345
I'm sorry.

576
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,094
Tyrion.

577
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,064
Put down the crossbow.

578
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,970
Who released you?

579
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:25,405
Your brother,
I expect.

580
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,741
He always had
a soft spot for you.

581
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,545
Come, we'll go and talk
in my chambers.

582
00:57:35,984 --> 00:57:38,952
This is how you want
to speak to me, hmm?

583
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:41,455
<i>Shaming your father has</i>
<i>always given you pleasure.</i>

584
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:43,257
All my life

585
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:45,826
you've wanted me dead.

586
00:57:47,528 --> 00:57:49,563
Yes.

587
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:52,266
<i>But you refused to die.</i>

588
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,067
I respect that.

589
00:57:54,102 --> 00:57:55,969
Even admire it.

590
00:57:56,004 --> 00:57:58,005
<i>You fight</i>
<i>for what's yours.</i>

591
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:00,407
I'd never let them
execute you.

592
00:58:00,441 --> 00:58:01,742
Is that what you fear?

593
00:58:01,776 --> 00:58:04,611
<i>I'll never let Ilyn Payne</i>
<i>take your head.</i>

594
00:58:04,646 --> 00:58:06,713
You're a Lannister.

595
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:11,752
You're my son.

596
00:58:13,254 --> 00:58:14,855
I loved her.

597
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:16,890
Who?

598
00:58:16,924 --> 00:58:19,326
Shae.

599
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,395
Oh, Tyrion.

600
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:25,165
- Put down that crossbow.
- I murdered her.

601
00:58:27,568 --> 00:58:29,436
With my own hands.

602
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,876
- It doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter?

603
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,512
She was a whore.

604
00:58:39,814 --> 00:58:41,715
- Say that word again...
- <i>And what?</i>

605
00:58:41,749 --> 00:58:44,184
You'll kill your own
father in the privy?

606
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,487
No.

607
00:58:47,522 --> 00:58:49,790
You're my son.

608
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:51,525
Now, enough
of this nonsense.

609
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:54,828
I am your son and you
sentenced me to die.

610
00:58:54,862 --> 00:58:58,298
You knew I didn't
poison Joffrey,

611
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,601
but you sentenced me
all the same.

612
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:04,237
- Why?
- Enough.

613
00:59:04,272 --> 00:59:05,839
<i>We'll go back</i>
<i>to my chambers</i>

614
00:59:05,873 --> 00:59:07,274
and speak
with some dignity.

615
00:59:07,308 --> 00:59:10,143
I can't go back there.
She's in there.

616
00:59:10,178 --> 00:59:11,678
You're afraid
of a dead whore?

617
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:25,992
You shot me.

618
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:37,137
You're no son of mine.

619
00:59:37,171 --> 00:59:38,739
I am your son.

620
00:59:39,841 --> 00:59:43,110
I have always
been your son.

621
00:59:57,058 --> 00:59:59,426
What have you done?

622
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:02,662
Quickly.

623
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:08,702
Trust me, my friend.
I brought you this far.

624
01:02:03,584 --> 01:02:05,418
I want to see
the captain.

625
01:02:05,453 --> 01:02:07,120
You're seeing him.

626
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:09,689
I want to go north
to the Wall.

627
01:02:09,724 --> 01:02:11,892
No, you don't.

628
01:02:12,894 --> 01:02:14,227
I can pay.

629
01:02:14,262 --> 01:02:17,731
There is nothing in the North
 but ice and war and pirates.

630
01:02:17,765 --> 01:02:20,066
I wouldn't need a cabin.
Please.

631
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:22,369
I could work
scrubbing the floors.

632
01:02:22,403 --> 01:02:25,105
I'm not going north, child.
I'm going home.

633
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:28,542
- Where's home?
- The Free City of Braavos.

634
01:02:29,544 --> 01:02:31,177
Wait.
I have something else.

635
01:02:31,212 --> 01:02:32,913
More silver won't make
a difference.

636
01:02:32,947 --> 01:02:36,283
It's not silver.
It's iron.

637
01:02:38,386 --> 01:02:40,353
This...

638
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:45,659
How did you--

639
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:47,761
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

640
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:51,598
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

641
01:02:51,632 --> 01:02:54,467
Of course,
you shall have a cabin.
