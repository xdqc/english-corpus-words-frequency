4
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,770
My name

5
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:03,440
is Grey Worm.

6
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,110
I come from

7
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:10,180
the Summer "Ills."

8
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,981
Isles.

9
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:15,118
Summer Isles.

10
00:02:15,152 --> 00:02:18,354
<i>Summer Isles.</i>

11
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,665
I am from an island
called Naath.

12
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:33,236
When they took you?

13
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,473
<i>"When</i> did <i>they take me?"</i>

14
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:41,744
I was five years old.

15
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,913
You remember your home?

16
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:48,218
I remember when they
rowed us away from shore.

17
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:53,756
How white
the beaches were.

18
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,427
How tall the trees.

19
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:03,633
And I remember
my village burning.

20
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:07,170
Smoke rising
into the sky.

21
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,813
Do you remember your home?

22
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,049
Unsullied.

23
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:22,619
Always Unsullied.

24
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:25,989
Before Unsullied,
nothing.

25
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,258
That's not true.

26
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,962
Perhaps one day you will return
to the Summer Isles.

27
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:34,797
I don't want return.

28
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,671
Kill the masters.

29
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,274
Kill the masters.

30
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:47,810
<i>How are the lessons coming?</i>

31
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:50,780
Very well,
Your Grace.

32
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,217
Missandei is teacher
good, my queen.

33
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:59,055
You'll have
to continue later.

34
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,026
It's time.

35
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:55,324
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

36
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:59,228
Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa!

37
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,732
Mhysa! Mhysa!

38
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,472
<i>Remind me, Ser Jorah,</i>

39
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:47,009
<i>how many children did the</i>
<i>Great Masters nail to mileposts?</i>

40
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:50,346
163, Khaleesi.

41
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,381
Yes, that was it.

42
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,693
<i>Your Grace,</i>
<i>may I have a word?</i>

43
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,566
The city is yours.

44
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:13,402
<i>All these people,</i>
<i>they're your subjects now.</i>

45
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,139
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice

46
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:18,975
with mercy.

47
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:23,145
I will answer injustice
with justice.

48
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,626
What the hell was that?

49
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,129
That was me knocking your ass
to the dirt

50
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:48,864
with your own hand.

51
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:52,969
You're a rare talent.

52
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:56,238
When you're fighting
cripples, anyway.

53
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,775
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

54
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,642
I'll bet that thrust
through the Mad King's back

55
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,878
was pretty as a picture.

56
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,247
<i>You want to fight pretty</i>
<i>or you want to win?</i>

57
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,083
You talk to my brother
this way?

58
00:11:07,117 --> 00:11:08,651
All the time.

59
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,020
He got used to it.

60
00:11:18,462 --> 00:11:20,930
Do you think
he did it?

61
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,032
No.

62
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,568
Oh, he hated
the little twat, sure.

63
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,603
But who didn't?

64
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,639
And poison's
not his style.

65
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,076
Or murder,
for that matter.

66
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,813
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

67
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:44,320
You haven't been
to see him yet, eh?

68
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:47,256
We're done for today.

69
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,461
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

70
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,664
You stood for him in his trial
by combat at the Eyrie.

71
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,833
Aye.

72
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,869
But only when
Lady Arryn demanded

73
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:02,538
the trial take place
that day.

74
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:04,707
You were his first choice.

75
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,143
He named you
for his champion

76
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,271
because he knew you
would ride day and night

77
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,296
to come fight for him.

78
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,250
You gonna fight
for him now?

79
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,927
To tell you the truth,
this isn't so bad.

80
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:28,030
Four walls.
A pot to piss in.

81
00:12:28,065 --> 00:12:30,833
I was chained
to a wooden post

82
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,469
covered in my own
shit for months.

83
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:39,041
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

84
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:40,810
Maybe a bit.

85
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,548
I'm sorry I didn't
come sooner.

86
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:48,417
It's complicated, yes.

87
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:52,421
- So how is our sister?
- How do you think?

88
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:55,057
Her son died in her arms.

89
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:57,660
Her son?

90
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,062
Don't.

91
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,836
You know what's coming?

92
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,672
My trial for regicide.
Yes, I know.

93
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,743
I know the whole bloody
country thinks I'm guilty.

94
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:16,946
I know that one
of my three judges

95
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,215
has wished me dead more
times than I can count.

96
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,750
And that judge
is my father.

97
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,353
As for Cersei,

98
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,355
well, she's probably
working on a way

99
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:29,225
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

100
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:32,695
Now that you mention it,
she did ask.

101
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,598
So, should I turn around
and close my eyes?

102
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,766
Depends.

103
00:13:37,801 --> 00:13:40,002
Did you do it?

104
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,770
The Kingslayer brothers.

105
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:45,207
You like it?
I like it.

106
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,678
You're really asking
if I killed your son?

107
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:53,249
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

108
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:58,687
How can I help you?

109
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:01,257
Well, you could
set me free.

110
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:04,426
You know I can't.

111
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:07,496
Then there's really
nothing else to say.

112
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:09,899
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guards?

113
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,400
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

114
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,369
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

115
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:15,171
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

116
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:17,306
I'd hate for you to do
something inappropriate.

117
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,807
Inappropriate?

118
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,810
You're accused of killing the king.
Freeing you is treason.

119
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,746
Except I didn't do it.

120
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,781
Which is why
we're having a trial.

121
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,117
A trial.

122
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:30,886
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

123
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,459
confessed to his crimes,

124
00:14:32,484 --> 00:14:34,918
and gave irrefutable
evidence of his guilt,

125
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:36,692
<i>it wouldn't matter</i>
<i>to Cersei.</i>

126
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:39,728
She won't rest
until my head's on a spike.

127
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,897
Not just yours.

128
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:45,301
She's offering a knighthood
to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

129
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:46,936
Sansa couldn't
have done this.

130
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,193
She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

131
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:50,469
Do you think it's a coincidence

132
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:52,308
she disappeared the same
night Joffrey died?

133
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,577
No, but...

134
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:57,813
Sansa's not a killer.

135
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,483
Not yet, anyway.

136
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,999
Where are you taking me?

137
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19,201
I'm getting married
to your Aunt Lysa.

138
00:15:19,236 --> 00:15:21,470
She's waiting for us
at the Eyrie.

139
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:24,273
You'll be safe there.

140
00:15:36,386 --> 00:15:38,087
Did you kill Joffrey?

141
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:41,290
Did I kill Joffrey?

142
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:44,593
I've been in
the Vale for weeks.

143
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:45,794
I know it was you.

144
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:49,765
And who helped me
with this conspiracy?

145
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,669
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

146
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,904
You used him to get
me out of King's Landing,

147
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:58,540
but you would never trust
him to kill the king.

148
00:15:58,642 --> 00:15:59,600
Why not?

149
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,823
Because you're too smart
to trust a drunk.

150
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:04,780
Then perhaps it was
your husband.

151
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,348
No.

152
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,117
<i>How do you know?</i>

153
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,786
I just do.

154
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,955
You're right.

155
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:15,457
He wasn't involved
in Joffrey's death.

156
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:17,526
But you were.

157
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:22,264
<i>Do you remember that lovely</i>
<i>necklace Dontos gave you?</i>

158
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:26,468
<i>I don't suppose you noticed</i>
<i>that a stone was missing</i>

159
00:16:26,536 --> 00:16:28,771
<i>after the feast.</i>

160
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,340
The poison.

161
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:35,377
I don't understand.

162
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,980
The Lannisters gave you
wealth, power.

163
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,815
Joffrey made you
the Lord of Harrenhal.

164
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:42,718
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

165
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,421
<i>Always keep</i>
<i>your foes confused.</i>

166
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:48,357
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

167
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:51,493
they can't know
what you plan to do next.

168
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,432
I don't believe you.

169
00:16:58,201 --> 00:17:00,602
<i>If they catch you,</i>
<i>they'll put your head on a spike</i>

170
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,004
<i>just like my father's.</i>

171
00:17:02,038 --> 00:17:05,240
You'd risk that
just to confuse them?

172
00:17:06,843 --> 00:17:10,379
So many men,
they risk so little.

173
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:13,415
They spend their lives
avoiding danger.

174
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,851
And then they die.

175
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:20,956
I'd risk everything
to get what I want.

176
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,126
And what do you want?

177
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,667
Everything.

178
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:36,839
My friendship with the Lannisters
was productive.

179
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:39,575
But Joffrey,

180
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:42,144
a vicious boy with
a crown on his head,

181
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,446
is not a reliable ally.

182
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,448
And who could trust
a friend like that?

183
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,717
Who could trust you?

184
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,287
I don't want
friends like me.

185
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,790
My new friends
are predictable.

186
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,325
Very reasonable people.

187
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:59,061
<i>As for what</i>
<i>happened to Joffrey,</i>

188
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:03,399
well, that was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

189
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:05,901
<i>Nothing like</i>
<i>a thoughtful gift</i>

190
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:08,537
<i>to make a new friendship</i>
<i>grow strong.</i>

191
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,472
I can't believe
you're going.

192
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,108
Leaving me alone here
with these people.

193
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:15,477
<i>The time has come,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

194
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,547
There's nothing
more tedious than a trial.

195
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,049
Except perhaps
these gardens.

196
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:23,819
If I have to take one
more leisurely stroll

197
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,055
through these gardens,
I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

198
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,592
Have you been
to see Tommen yet?

199
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,594
No.

200
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:34,563
Have they even agreed
to the match?

201
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,331
No one tells me anything.

202
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,621
I wasn't originally meant

203
00:18:37,646 --> 00:18:39,801
to marry your grandfather
Luthor, you know.

204
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,971
He was engaged
to my sister,

205
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,174
your great-aunt Viola.

206
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,444
I was to be given
to some Targaryen or other.

207
00:18:48,478 --> 00:18:52,214
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

208
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,783
But the moment
I saw my intended,

209
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:58,187
with his twitchy
little ferret's face

210
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,155
and ludicrous silver hair,

211
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,224
I knew he wouldn't do.

212
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:04,793
So the evening

213
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:07,896
before Luthor was
to propose to my sister,

214
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,599
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

215
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,935
and happened
upon his chamber.

216
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:16,538
- How absentminded of me.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,742
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

218
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:24,513
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

219
00:19:24,547 --> 00:19:26,849
And once he could,
the only thing he wanted

220
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:29,284
was what I'd given him
the night before.

221
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,487
I was good.

222
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:34,223
I was very, very good.

223
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:38,660
You are even better.

224
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,295
But you need
to act quickly.

225
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,166
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

226
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,102
She'll turn the boy
against you as soon as she can.

227
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:50,439
And by the time you're married,
it'll be too late.

228
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,441
Luckily for you,
the Queen Regent

229
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:54,309
is rather distracted
at the moment.

230
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:56,778
mourning her dear
departed boy.

231
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:59,181
Accusing her brother
of his murder,

232
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,183
which he didn't commit.

233
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,351
Well, he could have done.

234
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:04,319
He could have done,
but he didn't.

235
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:07,356
- You don't know, Grandmother.
- But I do know.

236
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,960
You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

237
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,064
What?
I don't understand.

238
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,701
Shh. Don't you worry
yourself about all that.

239
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:24,373
You just do
what needs to be done.

240
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:27,843
<i>Bring it through!</i>

241
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:37,486
And again.

242
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:46,728
Very nice. Good.

243
00:20:46,763 --> 00:20:49,431
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

244
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:52,467
First thing you want to do

245
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:55,270
is disarm them to try
and even the odds.

246
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,719
Let's see what you can do.

247
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:14,423
Olly, you just watch
for now.

248
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:15,524
I can fight.

249
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,626
Have you ever
held a sword before?

250
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,695
I was the best archer
in our hamlet.

251
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:22,130
I was!

252
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:24,466
I believe you.

253
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,134
We'll go hunting
for rabbits one day.

254
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,869
Rit now,
watch and learn.

255
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:32,140
You two.

256
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:35,277
Take it slow,
try and disarm each other.

257
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,804
You know how to fight.

258
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,307
You could have gone
easier on him.

259
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:07,776
He wouldn't have learned
anything that way.

260
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:13,281
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>you're doing?</i>

261
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:15,951
Grenn and I were
helping them.

262
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,086
Grenn's a ranger.
You're a steward.

263
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:21,223
Maybe you forgot that while you
were off with your wildling bitch,

264
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,225
but I didn't.

265
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,594
Someone has
to train them.

266
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:27,496
And that someone
isn't you.

267
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,865
Go find a chamber pot
to empty.

268
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,170
Go on. Do it.

269
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,205
You traitor's bastard.

270
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,174
Give me an excuse.

271
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,110
Mormont's not here
to protect you now.

272
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:55,524
Get back to work.

273
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:57,959
Now!

274
00:22:57,994 --> 00:23:00,529
I said now!

275
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:06,768
The bastard's well-liked.
You're not.

276
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,371
You think I care if they like me?
We're at war.

277
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,939
For now.

278
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:13,175
But you can't be
acting commander forever.

279
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:15,343
There will be a choosing.

280
00:23:15,378 --> 00:23:17,312
The old maester
will insist on it.

281
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:19,815
You might reconsider

282
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:22,584
his request to march
on Craster's.

283
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:26,221
Let the mutineers
take care of Snow.

284
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,657
Or you might be taking
orders from him

285
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:30,258
the rest of your life.

286
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:47,275
A bastard, eh?

287
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,045
Took you for highborn.

288
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:53,415
My father was highborn.

289
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:56,118
My mother wasn't.

290
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:00,188
Name's Locke.

291
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,025
Jon Snow.

292
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:08,930
You fight well.

293
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:10,665
What brought you up here?

294
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,801
A sense of duty.

295
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:16,104
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

296
00:24:18,808 --> 00:24:21,376
I was a game warden
in the Stormlands.

297
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,012
Fed a prized partridge
to my hungry kids.

298
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,847
I was stupid enough
to get caught.

299
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:28,016
Chose the Wall
over losing my hand.

300
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,753
Figured I wouldn't have to suck up
to any highborn cunts here.

301
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:34,022
<i>Come on, get on with it.</i>

302
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,791
What are you
waiting for? Summer?

303
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:37,292
Guess I was wrong.

304
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,581
You sent for me,
Your Grace?

305
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:01,550
Your Grace.

306
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,385
How formal of you.

307
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:08,523
How many Kingsguards
are posted outside Tommen's door?

308
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,960
Ser Boros
is on duty tonight.

309
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:14,329
- Tomorrow I believe--
- <i>So one?</i>

310
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,500
You have one man
guarding the future king?

311
00:25:18,534 --> 00:25:20,602
I promise you
Tommen's safe.

312
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:21,870
We're protecting him.

313
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:25,040
The way you
protected Joffrey?

314
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,910
Why did Catelyn Stark
set you free?

315
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:31,613
- What?
- I've been wondering for months.

316
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:35,417
Ever since that great cow brought
you back to the capital.

317
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,086
Why did she
set you free?

318
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,183
You know why.

319
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,180
She'd hoped I'd send
her daughters back to her.

320
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,063
She hoped
or did you promise?

321
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:49,931
I swore by all the gods

322
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,434
that if her daughters were alive,
I'd return them to her.

323
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,369
So you made a sacred vow
to the enemy.

324
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:57,105
I wanted to get
back to you.

325
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,908
Should I have told her
to fuck off?

326
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:01,843
You didn't mean it, then?

327
00:26:01,878 --> 00:26:04,880
You have no loyalty
to Catelyn Stark?

328
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:06,781
Catelyn Stark's dead.

329
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:09,084
So if I told you to leave the capital
right now and find Sansa,

330
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:13,255
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

331
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,323
and bring me her head,

332
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,592
would you do it?

333
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:24,366
I know you went
to see Tyrion.

334
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:30,538
That creature
who murdered our son.

335
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:35,010
I had to see him.

336
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:36,544
I had to know
for myself.

337
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:38,580
And?

338
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:42,784
He didn't do it, Cersei.

339
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:45,287
You've always pitied him.

340
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:48,657
Our poor little brother.

341
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,458
Abused by the world.

342
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:52,460
Despised by his father
and sister.

343
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:55,363
He'd kill us all
if he could.

344
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,536
I want four men
at Tommen's door day and night.

345
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,774
That will be all,
Lord Commander.

346
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:42,444
Ser Pounce?

347
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:58,593
How did you get past
the Kingsguard?

348
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:01,262
Kingsguard.

349
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:05,834
I don't think you're
supposed to be here.

350
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:08,870
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

351
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:11,439
I'm not a visitor,
Your Grace.

352
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:14,709
Word has it
I'm to be your bride.

353
00:28:19,815 --> 00:28:22,183
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

354
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:25,253
often never meet
until their wedding day?

355
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,593
Before we decide to spend
our lives together,

356
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,828
we ought to get
to know one another.

357
00:28:33,863 --> 00:28:36,031
Don't you think?

358
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:39,401
Yes.

359
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,469
But if my mother
found out--

360
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:44,139
It can be our secret.
Hmm?

361
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:48,543
If we're going to be
man and wife,

362
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:52,480
we'll have a few secrets
from her, I hope.

363
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:56,484
So, Your Grace...

364
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,853
Yes?

365
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:01,689
Tell me a secret.

366
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:11,433
Hello. Aren't you
a proper fellow?

367
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,835
That's Ser Pounce.

368
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:16,237
Very handsome.

369
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:19,741
Joffrey didn't like him.

370
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:22,243
He threatened
to skin him alive

371
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:24,112
and mix his innards
up in my food

372
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:25,914
so I wouldn't know
I was eating him.

373
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:28,683
That's very cruel.

374
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:31,653
You don't strike me
as cruel.

375
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:34,823
No.

376
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,724
I don't think I am.

377
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,793
That's a relief.

378
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:41,162
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

379
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,431
We say our vows in front
of the high septon.

380
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,266
And after the ceremony,
there's a feast.

381
00:29:45,301 --> 00:29:47,735
When we marry,
I become yours.

382
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,337
Forever.

383
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:53,842
It's getting late.

384
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,278
I should go.

385
00:29:58,314 --> 00:29:59,914
May I come and visit
you again?

386
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,886
All right, then.

387
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:11,426
Remember,

388
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,096
our little secret.

389
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:53,668
<i>"Ser Jaime Lannister.</i>

390
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:57,472
<i>Knighted and named</i>
<i>to the Kingsguard in his 16th year.</i>

391
00:30:57,506 --> 00:31:00,008
At the sack
of King's Landing,

392
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,443
murdered his king
Aerys II.

393
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:05,680
Pardoned by
Robert Baratheon.

394
00:31:06,982 --> 00:31:08,950
Thereafter known
as the Kingslayer."

395
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:12,287
It's the duty of the Lord Commander
to fill those pages.

396
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:18,259
And there's still room
left on mine.

397
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,892
Valyrian steel.

398
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,394
Mmm.

399
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:54,729
It's yours.

400
00:31:54,763 --> 00:31:56,397
I can't accept this.

401
00:31:56,432 --> 00:31:58,733
It was reforged
from Ned Stark's sword.

402
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,869
You'll use it to defend
Ned Stark's daughter.

403
00:32:03,472 --> 00:32:07,442
You swore an oath to return the
Stark girls to their mother.

404
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:09,844
Lady Stark's dead.

405
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,813
Arya's probably
dead, too,

406
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,016
but there's still a chance to find Sansa
and get her somewhere safe.

407
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:17,986
I've got something
else for you.

408
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,140
<i>I hope I got</i>
<i>your measurements right.</i>

409
00:32:41,777 --> 00:32:43,444
I'll find her.

410
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:48,249
For Lady Catelyn.

411
00:32:51,253 --> 00:32:52,954
And for you.

412
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:01,996
I almost forgot.

413
00:33:02,965 --> 00:33:05,133
I have one more gift.

414
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:10,838
I don't need a squire.

415
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:12,774
Of course you do.

416
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:14,409
He'll slow me down.

417
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:16,778
My brother owes him a debt.
He's not safe here.

418
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:19,347
You're keeping him from harm.
It's chivalry.

419
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:22,417
I won't
slow you down, ser--

420
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,887
my lady.

421
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,389
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I'll serve you well.</i>

422
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:31,726
See? He's a good lad.
You'll get along.

423
00:33:35,831 --> 00:33:38,232
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

424
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,269
His axe from the Blackwater.

425
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,443
What are you
waiting for, a kiss?

426
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:52,380
Ready the lady's horse.

427
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,125
They say the best swords
have names.

428
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,593
Any ideas?

429
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,434
Oathkeeper.

430
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,814
Good-bye, Brienne.

431
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,740
Come on, move.

432
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:19,467
I should never
have taken her away.

433
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:22,637
- She wasn't safe here.
- She's not safe out there.

434
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:24,505
I should have known.

435
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,707
You told us there were
wildlings south of the Wall.

436
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:29,510
<i>If they're raiding the smaller villages,</i>
<i>Mole's Town could be next.</i>

437
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,914
- Castle Black could be next.
- I should go back for Gilly.

438
00:35:32,948 --> 00:35:34,549
We have orders.
No one's to leave the castle.

439
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,084
I remember when you disobeyed orders
and rode south to help Robb.

440
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,320
And I remember who came after me
and brought me home.

441
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:44,792
I know how hard
it is, Sam, believe me.

442
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:49,664
When you told me about Bran
going beyond the Wall,

443
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:51,621
all I could think about
was getting my strength back

444
00:35:51,646 --> 00:35:53,292
so I could go and find him.

445
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,938
I wish I could have convinced
him to come back with me.

446
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:01,242
I tried.
Really, I did.

447
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:05,813
How fast could they travel?

448
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:09,317
A crippled boy being pulled
on a sledge by a simpleton?

449
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:10,885
I don't know.

450
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,154
They'd pass
wildling villages.

451
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:16,224
They could try to find
shelter at one of them.

452
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,461
The wildlings
have joined up with Mance.

453
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:23,798
Every village or sheltered place
will be deserted.

454
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,237
Except...

455
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:34,809
<i>Craster's?</i>

456
00:36:34,843 --> 00:36:37,278
You think Bran
might have found--

457
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:39,747
Snow.

458
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,415
I don't mean
to interrupt.

459
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,118
Thorne wants to see you.

460
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:50,258
Your foray
to Craster's Keep,

461
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,360
I'll sanction it.

462
00:36:52,394 --> 00:36:56,264
But I won't order
anyone to go with you.

463
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:58,966
Volunteers only.

464
00:36:59,001 --> 00:37:01,168
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

465
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,648
Ahem, brothers.

466
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,662
I'm going beyond the Wall
to Craster's Keep.

467
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:32,066
I'm going to capture the mutineers
holed up there or kill them.

468
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,202
<i>I'm asking for volunteers</i>
<i>to come with me.</i>

469
00:37:36,872 --> 00:37:39,540
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and Craster's

470
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:42,376
and Mance Rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

471
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:44,478
but we have to do this.

472
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:47,782
<i>Our survival</i>
<i>may depend on</i>

473
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:50,651
<i>us getting to these mutineers</i>
<i>before Mance does.</i>

474
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:54,355
They know the Wall.
They know our defenses.

475
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:57,391
If Mance learns what
they know, we're lost.

476
00:37:59,828 --> 00:38:02,163
But if that's not enough,

477
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,665
then consider this.

478
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,034
If the Night's Watch
are truly brothers,

479
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:10,037
then Lord Commander Mormont
was our father.

480
00:38:11,306 --> 00:38:13,407
He lived and died
for the Watch

481
00:38:13,442 --> 00:38:15,910
and he was betrayed
by his own men.

482
00:38:15,978 --> 00:38:17,645
Stabbed in the back
by cowards.

483
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,614
He deserved far better.

484
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:23,184
All we can give him now
is justice.

485
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:26,487
Who will join me?

486
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:18,739
I can't let a recruit
come north of the Wall.

487
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,042
Then let me say my vows.

488
00:39:21,076 --> 00:39:22,437
If it's a fight you're
heading for,

489
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
then you need men
who know how.

490
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,659
Thank you, brothers.

491
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:48,436
<i>No, don't.</i>

492
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,238
<i>Don't, please.</i>

493
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:53,374
<i>Please don't. Ow!</i>

494
00:39:53,408 --> 00:39:55,342
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

495
00:40:01,016 --> 00:40:04,952
Karl Tanner
from Gin Alley

496
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,122
drinking wine
from the skull

497
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:11,625
of Jeor fucking Mormont.

498
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:21,969
Any command for us,
Lord Commander?

499
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:24,572
What's that?

500
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:27,041
Fuck 'em
till they're dead?

501
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:30,611
<i>Did you hear that, boys?</i>

502
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:33,280
Fuck 'em
till they're dead.

503
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,222
Rast.

504
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,963
Go outside
and feed the beast.

505
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:51,332
We should kill that thing.

506
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:55,336
You should shut
your fucking hole,

507
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,372
ugly little cunt.

508
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:01,809
You look like
a fucking ballsack.

509
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:04,612
Ugly. Look at your
stupid cunt face.

510
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:08,215
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

511
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:13,621
Know how much they paid me to kill
a man in King's Landing?

512
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:16,257
Seven silvers.

513
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:20,027
They told me a man's name
and that man never saw daylight again.

514
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,830
None of them cocksuckers
got away from me.

515
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:29,436
Haven't lost a fight
since I was nine.

516
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:33,307
Maybe it's time.

517
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:36,076
What do you think, eh?

518
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:39,180
Maybe you're the man.

519
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:42,349
Eh, cunt?

520
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,087
I wouldn't stand a chance.

521
00:41:47,956 --> 00:41:49,156
None of us would.

522
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:52,226
I was a fucking legend
in Gin Alley.

523
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,362
A fucking legend!

524
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:56,997
I would take any knight--

525
00:41:57,032 --> 00:41:59,767
any knight, any time.

526
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:03,470
Fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

527
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:15,482
- A gift for the gods.
- A gift for the gods.

528
00:42:15,517 --> 00:42:17,084
A gift for the gods.

529
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,652
What the fuck is that?

530
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:21,856
Craster's last child.
A boy.

531
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,424
What am I supposed
to do with him?

532
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,293
What did Craster
do with 'em?

533
00:42:26,328 --> 00:42:29,530
Kill 'em before they could grow up
and do the same to him?

534
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:32,600
All right.

535
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:37,671
Don't need another
mouth to feed.

536
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:40,908
- Hand him over.
- He didn't kill them.

537
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:43,644
- He offered them.
- To who?

538
00:42:43,678 --> 00:42:45,846
To the gods.

539
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:48,148
The white walkers.

540
00:42:48,183 --> 00:42:50,217
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

541
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:53,087
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

542
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:55,623
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

543
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,358
Shut up!

544
00:43:03,431 --> 00:43:05,499
So...

545
00:43:07,969 --> 00:43:10,504
if it worked for him...

546
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:14,875
Let's give the walkers
what they want.

547
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,451
Rast is headed that way.

548
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:53,674
Pink-eyed fuck.

549
00:44:57,012 --> 00:44:59,213
You thirsty?

550
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:20,934
Fuck!

551
00:45:54,536 --> 00:45:56,570
Hodor.

552
00:46:02,377 --> 00:46:03,911
Do you hear that?

553
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,119
Is that a baby?

554
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:14,721
It's coming.

555
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:16,490
I'm going out there.

556
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,625
No, we need
to stay together.

557
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,527
I'm going.

558
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,538
- Bran. Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

559
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,206
- Hodor.
- Bran, what happened?

560
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,942
Summer, he's hurt.
They've caught him in a trap.

561
00:47:08,977 --> 00:47:10,344
Who?

562
00:47:10,378 --> 00:47:13,046
I didn't see, but they
have my brother's wolf.

563
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:16,884
They have Ghost.

564
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:23,857
<i>They're Night's Watch.</i>

565
00:47:23,892 --> 00:47:25,993
Look.

566
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:28,462
<i>Jon might be here.</i>

567
00:47:28,496 --> 00:47:31,832
If Jon was here, why would
they put his wolf in a cage?

568
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:40,407
They might have been
Night's Watch once, not anymore.

569
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,276
We're not safe here.
We need to go.

570
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,810
No.

571
00:47:43,845 --> 00:47:46,180
Bran, we need to go now.

572
00:47:46,214 --> 00:47:48,081
I'm not leaving
without Summer.

573
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:56,590
Can you remember
where the cage was?

574
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,193
The east side
of the keep.

575
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:04,631
If I'm not back
soon, we'll meet--

576
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:06,500
Hodor.

577
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:21,848
Hodor.

578
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,553
Hodor.
Hodor.

579
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:32,626
Hodor.

580
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,896
If I was your size,
I'd be king of the fucking world.

581
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:49,576
Help him up.

582
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,001
This is nice.

583
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:17,838
Fine leather.

584
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,275
You're no wildling.

585
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:23,810
Important. Highborn.

586
00:49:26,014 --> 00:49:28,181
Who are you?

587
00:49:37,525 --> 00:49:39,192
You see,
where I come from,

588
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,762
a commoner like me slaps
a little lord like you,

589
00:49:41,796 --> 00:49:44,031
I'd lose my right hand.

590
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:48,101
But we're a long way
from home, aren't we?

591
00:49:49,537 --> 00:49:51,571
And the two of you,

592
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:55,175
fancy-looking folks
north of the Wall

593
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:57,444
creeping through
the woods.

594
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,081
Isn't that a bit odd?

595
00:50:04,485 --> 00:50:06,753
I like your curly hair.

596
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:11,758
My mom had curls
like that.

597
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:14,761
Beautiful brown curls.

598
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:19,333
Why'd you drag a crippled
boy all the way up here?

599
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:28,308
See you haven't played
this game before.

600
00:50:28,343 --> 00:50:30,644
A highborn hostage,

601
00:50:30,678 --> 00:50:33,547
<i>that's valuable.</i>

602
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:36,016
But three of them,

603
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,052
that's a lot
of mouths to feed.

604
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:41,798
<i>What the fuck's</i>
<i>wrong with him?</i>

605
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:42,422
Come here.

606
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:44,424
No, please.

607
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:45,859
Please.
Please, let me help him.

608
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:47,794
- Who are you? - Pleas.

609
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:51,164
- Who are you?
- I'm Brandon Stark!

610
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:53,800
I'm Brandon Stark
of Winterfell.

611
00:50:56,204 --> 00:50:58,772
It's Jon Snow's brother.

612
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,676
It's Meera. It's Meera.
I'm right here.

613
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:07,414
And I thought this
was gonna be another boring day.

614
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,354
<i>I'm right here.</i>
