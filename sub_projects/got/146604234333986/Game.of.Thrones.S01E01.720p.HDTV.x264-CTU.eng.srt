1
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:58,457
Easy, boy.

2
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,368
<i>What do you expect?</i>
<i>They're savages.</i>

3
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,737
One lot steals a goat
from another lot,

4
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,774
before you know it they're
ripping each other to pieces.

5
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:20,976
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.

6
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,312
I never seen a thing like
this, not ever in my life.

7
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:26,216
How close did you get?

8
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,185
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.

9
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,356
Do the dead frighten you?

10
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,825
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.

11
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,694
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

12
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:41,397
You don't think
he'll ask us how they died?

13
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,334
Get back on your horse.

14
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,207
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

15
00:03:52,242 --> 00:03:54,209
They even killed the children.

16
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:57,313
It's a good thing
we're not children.

17
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,417
You want to run away south,
run away.

18
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:04,354
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,

19
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:06,757
if I don't catch you first.

20
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:11,295
Get back on your horse.

21
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,297
I won't say it again.

22
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:47,397
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

23
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:49,966
They were here.

24
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:55,606
See where they went.

25
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,255
What is it?

26
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,758
It's...

27
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:51,267
Go on, father's watching.

28
00:09:53,304 --> 00:09:55,205
<i>And your mother.</i>

29
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:04,583
Fine work as always.
Well done.

30
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,452
Thank you.

31
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:10,455
I love the detail that you've
managed to get in these corners.

32
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,424
<i>Quite beautiful.</i>

33
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,492
The stitching...

34
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:38,319
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

35
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:40,855
Keep practicing, Bran.

36
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:44,959
Go on.

37
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,862
Don't think too much, Bran.

38
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:51,398
Relax your bow arm.

39
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,011
Quick, Bran!
Faster.

40
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:09,582
Lord Stark!

41
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:12,618
My lady.

42
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:15,821
A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.

43
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,857
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

44
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:24,530
Get the lads to saddle
their horses.

45
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,598
Do you have to?

46
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,966
He swore an oath, Cat.

47
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,968
The law is law, my lady.

48
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:33,971
Tell Bran he's coming too.

49
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:37,440
Ned.

50
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,809
10 is too young
to see such things.

51
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:41,610
He won't be a boy forever.

52
00:11:43,513 --> 00:11:45,847
And winter is coming.

53
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:07,838
Lad, go run back
and get the rest.

54
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:14,278
White walkers.

55
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:17,047
I saw the white walkers.

56
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:19,016
White walkers.

57
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,118
The white walkers, I saw them.

58
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:32,796
I know I broke my oath.

59
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:35,899
And I know I'm a deserter.

60
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:39,636
I should have gone back to the
wall and warned them, but...

61
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,838
I saw what I saw.

62
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:43,873
I saw the white walkers.

63
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:47,611
<i>People need to know.</i>

64
00:12:49,747 --> 00:12:51,615
If you can get word
to my family...

65
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:54,051
<i>Tell them I'm no coward.</i>

66
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:56,220
<i>Tell them I'm sorry.</i>

67
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:14,805
Forgive me, lord.

68
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:21,511
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

69
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:23,446
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

70
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,349
- <i>...King of the Andals and the First Men...</i>
- Father will know if you do.

71
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:29,919
<i>...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms</i>
<i>and protector of the realm,</i>

72
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:32,689
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

73
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:35,593
Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,

74
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:38,162
sentence you to die.

75
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:55,078
You did well.

76
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:24,207
You understand why I did it?

77
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:26,209
Jon said he was a deserter.

78
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:28,911
But do you understand
why <i>I</i> had to kill him?

79
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,713
"Our way is the old way"?

80
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,283
The man who passes the sentence

81
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,051
should swing the sword.

82
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,455
Is it true he saw
the white walkers?

83
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:44,327
The white walkers have been
gone for thousands of years.

84
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,164
So he was lying?

85
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:53,905
A madman sees what he sees.

86
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,833
What is it?

87
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:26,271
Mountain lion?

88
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:29,575
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

89
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,560
It's a freak!

90
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:21,197
It's a direwolf.

91
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,774
Tough old beast.

92
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,978
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

93
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:38,146
Now there are five.

94
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,849
You want to hold it?

95
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:47,555
Where will they go?

96
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,391
Their mother's dead.

97
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,060
They don't belong down here.

98
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,028
Better a quick death.

99
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,930
They won't last
without their mother.

100
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,132
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

101
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,900
Put away your blade.

102
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,069
I take orders from
your father, not you.

103
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,905
- Please, father!
- I'm sorry, Bran.

104
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,808
Lord Stark?

105
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:08,310
There are five pups...

106
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,646
One for each
of the Stark children.

107
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,483
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

108
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,053
They were meant to have them.

109
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:25,427
You will train them yourselves.

110
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,429
You will feed them yourselves.

111
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,499
And if they die, you will
bury them yourselves.

112
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:40,842
What about you?

113
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:43,345
I'm not a Stark.

114
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,580
Get on.

115
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,059
What is it?

116
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:04,833
The runt of the litter...
That one's yours, Snow.

117
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:08,127
As your brother, I feel
it's my duty to warn you:

118
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,430
you worry too much.

119
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:14,800
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

120
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:20,073
<i>When we were seven and you jumped
off the cliffs at Casterly Rock,</i>

121
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:22,442
100-foot drop into the water,

122
00:19:22,476 --> 00:19:24,544
and you were never afraid.

123
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:27,280
There was nothing to be afraid
of until you told father.

124
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,181
"We're Lannisters.

125
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:31,683
Lannisters don't act like fools."

126
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:35,620
<i>What if Jon Arryn told someone?</i>

127
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:37,955
But who would he tell?

128
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,125
- My husband.
- If he told the king, both our heads

129
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,360
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

130
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:47,899
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or
didn't know, it died with him.

131
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,736
And Robert will choose a new Hand
of the King... someone to do his job

132
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,672
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores...

133
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:57,675
Or is it the other way around?

134
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,111
And life will go on.

135
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:02,714
You should be
the Hand of the King.

136
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:05,583
That's an honor
I can do without.

137
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:07,752
Their days are too long,

138
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:10,054
their lives are too short.

139
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:50,028
All these years

140
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:51,730
and I still feel like an outsider

141
00:20:51,764 --> 00:20:53,999
when I come here.

142
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:56,569
You have five northern children.

143
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:59,838
You're not an outsider.

144
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:02,808
I wonder if the old gods agree.

145
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,812
It's your gods with all the rules.

146
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:14,888
I am so sorry, my love.

147
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,827
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

148
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,398
Jon Arryn is dead.

149
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:26,101
<i>A fever took him.</i>

150
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,173
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a father to you.</i>

151
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:37,245
- <i>Your sister, the boy?</i>
- They both have their health,

152
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,447
<i>gods be good.</i>

153
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:52,093
The raven brought more news...

154
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,430
The king rides
for Winterfell...

155
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:57,165
With the queen

156
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,334
<i>and all the rest of them.</i>

157
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:02,638
If he's coming
this far north...

158
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:06,209
There's only one thing he's after.

159
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:09,279
You can always say no, Ned.

160
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:21,726
We'll need plenty of
candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

161
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,694
I'm told he reads all night.

162
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:25,630
I'm told he drinks all night.

163
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:28,967
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

164
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,768
Stature?

165
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:33,472
We've brought up eight barrels
of ale from the cellar.

166
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:36,041
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

167
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,744
<i>candles.</i>

168
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,919
Why is your mother so dead set on
us getting pretty for the king?

169
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:48,788
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

170
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:50,924
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

171
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:52,992
Think of all those southern
girls he gets to stab

172
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,594
with his right royal prick.

173
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:58,497
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

174
00:22:58,531 --> 00:23:01,000
He's never met a girl he likes
better than his own hair.

175
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:40,773
Gods, but they grow fast.

176
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:44,610
Brandon!

177
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:47,980
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

178
00:23:48,014 --> 00:23:51,217
How many times have I
told you no climbing?

179
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:54,119
But he's coming right
now... down our road.

180
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,528
I want you to promise me,

181
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,330
no more climbing.

182
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:11,336
I promise.

183
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:16,576
- Do you know what?
- What?

184
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,911
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

185
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:24,951
Run and find your father.
Tell him the king is close.

186
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:12,767
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

187
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:24,513
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.

188
00:25:24,547 --> 00:25:26,848
What are you doing
with that on?

189
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:31,787
Go on.

190
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:34,890
Move!

191
00:26:56,904 --> 00:26:58,905
Your Grace.

192
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:05,012
You've got fat.

193
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:19,726
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

194
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,998
Nine years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

195
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:27,933
Guarding the north
for you, Your Grace.

196
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:30,737
<i>Winterfell is yours.</i>

197
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:36,210
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

198
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:38,946
Who have we here?

199
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,748
You must be Robb.

200
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,055
My, you're a pretty one.

201
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,057
Your name is?

202
00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:51,659
Arya.

203
00:27:51,694 --> 00:27:54,730
Oh, show us your muscles.

204
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:58,000
You'll be a soldier.

205
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:03,406
<i>That's Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the queen's twin brother.</i>

206
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,642
<i>Would you please shut up?</i>

207
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,286
My queen.

208
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,955
My queen.

209
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,191
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

210
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:23,460
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

211
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,195
Surely the dead can wait.

212
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,197
Ned.

213
00:28:36,373 --> 00:28:38,174
Where's the Imp?

214
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:43,578
Where is our brother?

215
00:28:43,612 --> 00:28:45,813
Go and find the little beast.

216
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:50,351
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

217
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:53,020
One minute he was fine and then...

218
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:56,991
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

219
00:28:58,193 --> 00:29:00,128
I loved that man.

220
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:01,496
We both did.

221
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,766
He never had to
teach you much, but me?

222
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,034
You remember me at 16?

223
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:08,003
All I wanted to do

224
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,672
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

225
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:13,608
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

226
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:16,978
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

227
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:23,251
I need you, Ned...

228
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:27,189
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

229
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,593
Lord Eddard Stark,

230
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:34,229
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

231
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:40,736
I'm not worthy of the honor.

232
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,507
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

233
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:48,077
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

234
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:50,212
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

235
00:29:51,481 --> 00:29:53,650
You helped me win
the Iron Throne,

236
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:55,785
now help me
keep the damn thing.

237
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,821
We were meant to rule together.

238
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:02,924
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

239
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:05,327
Well, it's not too late.

240
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:08,664
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

241
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,234
We'll join our houses.

242
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:40,198
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

243
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:50,675
Did you hear the king's
in Winterfell?

244
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:52,644
I did hear something about that.

245
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:54,945
And the queen
and her twin brother.

246
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,115
They say that <i>he</i> is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

247
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,283
And the other brother?

248
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,353
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

249
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:06,389
and there's the clever one.

250
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:11,294
Mmm, I hear they
call him the Imp.

251
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,396
I hear he hates that nickname.

252
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,666
Oh? I hear he's more
than earned it.

253
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:19,469
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,

254
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,939
prone to all manner
of perversions.

255
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:23,874
Clever girl.

256
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,511
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

257
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:30,714
Have you?

258
00:31:30,748 --> 00:31:32,616
- Oh!
- Already?

259
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,488
The gods gave me one blessing.

260
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:44,895
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

261
00:31:44,929 --> 00:31:47,264
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

262
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:51,035
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

263
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:54,705
but our sister craves
your attention.

264
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,841
She has odd cravings,
our sister.

265
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:59,009
A family trait.

266
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:01,912
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.

267
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:04,148
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

268
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:06,551
<i>I'm sorry, I've begun</i>
<i>the feast a bit early.</i>

269
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:09,954
And this is the first
of many courses.

270
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:12,190
I thought you might say that.

271
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:14,625
But since we're short on time...

272
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:16,560
Come on, girls.

273
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:23,934
See you at sundown.

274
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:26,536
<i>Close the door!</i>

275
00:32:38,684 --> 00:32:41,686
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

276
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:45,724
<i>She should be</i>
<i>on a hill somewhere</i>

277
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,361
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

278
00:32:48,395 --> 00:32:50,363
<i>She was my sister.</i>

279
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:53,165
This is where she belongs.

280
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,735
She belonged with me.

281
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:04,377
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

282
00:33:05,912 --> 00:33:08,380
It's done, Your Grace.

283
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:11,050
The Targaryens are gone.

284
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:15,354
Not all of them.

285
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:28,233
<i>Daenerys!</i>

286
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:33,171
Daenerys.

287
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:35,240
There's our bride-to-be.

288
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:39,277
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

289
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:42,113
Touch it.

290
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:44,349
Go on, feel the fabric.

291
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:51,155
Mmm.

292
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:55,126
Isn't he a gracious host?

293
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,331
We've been his guests
for over a year

294
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:01,333
and he's never
asked us for anything.

295
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,102
Illyrio's no fool.

296
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,471
He knows I won't
forget my friends

297
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:07,540
when I come into my throne.

298
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,345
You still slouch.

299
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:20,384
Let them see.

300
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:25,922
You have a woman's body now.

301
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:46,442
I need you to be perfect today.

302
00:34:47,844 --> 00:34:49,745
Can you do that for me?

303
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,852
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

304
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:58,889
No.

305
00:35:05,831 --> 00:35:08,900
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

306
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:11,168
they will say it began today.

307
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,560
It's too hot, my lady.

308
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:59,549
Where is he?

309
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,217
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

310
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:19,603
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

311
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:21,572
May I present
my honored guests?

312
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:25,310
<i>Viserys of House Targaryen,</i>

313
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:27,045
<i>the third of his name,</i>

314
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,415
<i>the rightful King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

315
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,183
<i>and his sister</i>

316
00:36:32,218 --> 00:36:34,853
<i>Daenerys of House Targaryen.</i>

317
00:36:37,757 --> 00:36:40,225
Do you see
how long his hair is?

318
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,961
<i>When Dothraki are</i>
<i>defeated in combat,</i>

319
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:46,931
<i>they cut off their braids so the whole
world can see their shame.</i>

320
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:50,934
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

321
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:53,937
He's a savage, of course,

322
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:56,306
<i>but one of the finest killers alive.</i>

323
00:36:57,575 --> 00:36:59,709
And you will be his queen.

324
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:02,378
Come forward, my dear.

325
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:44,120
Where is he going?!

326
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:46,689
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

327
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:49,158
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, Your Grace,

328
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:51,694
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

329
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:56,966
It won't be long now.

330
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,901
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

331
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:01,370
and take back your father's throne.

332
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,305
The people drink secret toasts

333
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,040
to your health.

334
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:08,409
They cry out
for their true king.

335
00:38:12,014 --> 00:38:13,882
When will they be married?

336
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:17,453
Soon. The Dothraki never
stay still for long.

337
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:20,022
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

338
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:23,126
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

339
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:25,028
Do you take me for a fool?

340
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:26,897
I take you for a king.

341
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:30,134
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

342
00:38:30,168 --> 00:38:32,536
My apologies if
I've given offense.

343
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,939
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

344
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:37,875
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

345
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,779
I don't want to be his queen.

346
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:47,254
I want to go home.

347
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:49,622
So do I.

348
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:52,792
I want us both to go home,

349
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:55,127
but they took it from us.

350
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:56,929
So tell me, sweet sister,

351
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:59,165
how do we go home?

352
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,568
I don't know.

353
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:05,605
We go home with an army.

354
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:10,443
With Khal Drogo's army.

355
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:13,480
I would let his whole tribe fuck you...

356
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:16,717
All 40,000 men
and their horses too

357
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:18,619
if that's what it took.

358
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:38,170
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

359
00:39:38,204 --> 00:39:40,739
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

360
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:44,444
Then he is the stupidest
prince that ever lived.

361
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,348
He's so handsome.

362
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:52,084
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

363
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:55,221
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

364
00:39:55,255 --> 00:39:57,089
Why would he say no?

365
00:39:57,124 --> 00:40:00,393
He'd be the second most
powerful man in the kingdoms.

366
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:02,995
He'd have to leave home.

367
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,965
He'd have to leave me.

368
00:40:05,999 --> 00:40:09,002
And so would you.

369
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:11,637
You left your home
to come here.

370
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:14,473
And I'd be queen someday.

371
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:17,110
Please make father say yes!

372
00:40:17,144 --> 00:40:19,011
- Sansa...
- Please please!

373
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:21,981
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

374
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:37,964
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

375
00:40:37,998 --> 00:40:40,266
<i>Come on!</i>

376
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:01,520
Is he dead yet?

377
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:07,760
Uncle Benjen.

378
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:12,065
You got bigger.

379
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,003
Rode all day. Didn't want to leave
you alone with the Lannisters.

380
00:41:16,037 --> 00:41:17,972
Why aren't you at the feast?

381
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:21,042
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

382
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:23,278
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

383
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:26,015
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

384
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:28,250
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

385
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,985
So take me with you
when you go back.

386
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,888
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

387
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:35,123
I know he will.

388
00:41:37,593 --> 00:41:39,827
The wall isn't going anywhere.

389
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:41,195
I'm ready

390
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:42,563
to swear your oath.

391
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:45,299
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

392
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,801
We have no families.

393
00:41:47,835 --> 00:41:51,172
- None of us will ever father sons...
- I don't care about that!

394
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,842
You might, if you knew
what it meant.

395
00:41:58,147 --> 00:42:00,382
I'd better get inside,

396
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:03,085
rescue your father
from his guests.

397
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,124
We'll talk later.

398
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,766
<i>Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.</i>

399
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:24,071
What are you doing back there?

400
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:27,274
Preparing for a night
with your family.

401
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:33,847
I've always wanted
to see the wall.

402
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:35,616
You're Tyrion Lannister,

403
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,251
the queen's brother?

404
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:39,486
My greatest accomplishment.

405
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:43,290
And you... you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

406
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,929
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

407
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:53,500
You are the bastard though.

408
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:57,137
<i>Lord Eddard Stark is my father.</i>

409
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:01,007
And Lady Stark
is not your mother,

410
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,309
making you the bastard.

411
00:43:05,512 --> 00:43:08,314
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

412
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:11,283
Never forget what you are.

413
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:13,252
The rest of the world will not.

414
00:43:13,286 --> 00:43:15,855
Wear it like armor

415
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,425
and it can never
be used to hurt you.

416
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:23,064
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

417
00:43:24,366 --> 00:43:27,769
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

418
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:53,629
You at a feast...
It's like a bear in a trap.

419
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:57,799
The boy I beheaded...

420
00:43:57,834 --> 00:44:00,402
- Did you know him?
- Of course I did.

421
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:02,538
Just a lad.

422
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:04,306
And he was tough, Ned,

423
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,108
a true ranger.

424
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:09,612
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

425
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,016
Said the walkers
slaughtered his friends.

426
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,618
The two he was with
are still missing.

427
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:20,456
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

428
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,124
Maybe.

429
00:44:22,158 --> 00:44:25,694
Direwolves south of the wall,

430
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,230
talk of the walkers,

431
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:30,866
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

432
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,169
Winter <i>is</i> coming.

433
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:37,572
Winter is coming.

434
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:42,043
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

435
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:43,678
- How are you?
- I'm good.

436
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,617
Is this your first time
in the north, Your Grace?

437
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:52,788
Yes.
Lovely country.

438
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:59,896
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

439
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,267
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

440
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:05,536
up here for the first time.

441
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:09,406
Hello, little dove.

442
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,776
But you are a beauty.

443
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,911
- How old are you?
- 13, Your Grace.

444
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:17,680
You're tall.
Still growing?

445
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,615
I think so, Your Grace.

446
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,884
And have you bled yet?

447
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:28,456
No, Your Grace.

448
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,994
Your dress, did you make it?

449
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:36,632
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

450
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,504
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

451
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,774
I hear the same.

452
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:45,876
Your daughter will
do well in the Capital.

453
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,614
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

454
00:46:05,698 --> 00:46:09,001
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

455
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:10,702
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

456
00:46:10,737 --> 00:46:12,604
the king has honored me
with his offer.

457
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,139
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

458
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:16,141
to celebrate your new
title... if you accept.

459
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:18,378
It would be good
to have you on the field.

460
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:20,580
The competition
has become a bit stale.

461
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:23,350
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

462
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:24,885
Getting a little old for it?

463
00:46:24,919 --> 00:46:28,556
I don't fight in tournaments

464
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,091
because when I fight
a man for real

465
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:33,360
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

466
00:46:35,196 --> 00:46:36,996
Well said.

467
00:46:38,031 --> 00:46:40,966
Arya!

468
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,602
It's not funny!

469
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:46,371
<i>She always does this.</i>

470
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:48,273
<i>This was my favorite dress.</i>

471
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,576
She always does it
and it's not funny!

472
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:53,545
Time for bed.

473
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:07,561
I'm a Northman.

474
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:09,997
I belong here with you,
not down south

475
00:47:10,031 --> 00:47:12,533
in that rats' nest they call a Capital.

476
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:16,302
I <i>won't</i> let him take you.

477
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:20,239
The king takes what he wants.

478
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,841
That's why he's king.

479
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,745
I'll say,
"Listen, fat man."

480
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:31,649
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

481
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,085
He belongs to me now."

482
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,791
How did he get so fat?

483
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:42,660
He only stops eating when
it's time for a drink.

484
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,299
<i>It's Maester Luwin, my lord.</i>

485
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:52,204
Send him in.

486
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,208
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

487
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:59,078
A rider in the night...

488
00:47:59,112 --> 00:48:01,214
From your sister.

489
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:11,558
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

490
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:19,799
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

491
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:22,468
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

492
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,946
What news?

493
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:37,051
<i>She's fled the Capital.</i>

494
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:41,856
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

495
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:43,859
By the Lannisters.

496
00:48:43,893 --> 00:48:46,662
She says the king is in danger.

497
00:48:46,696 --> 00:48:48,965
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

498
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:51,000
She doesn't know what she's saying.

499
00:48:51,034 --> 00:48:53,536
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

500
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,738
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

501
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:58,474
Do you think she would risk her life...

502
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:00,142
her son's life...

503
00:49:00,176 --> 00:49:03,646
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

504
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,689
If this news is true

505
00:49:12,723 --> 00:49:15,726
and the Lannisters conspire
against the Throne,

506
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,062
who but you can
protect the king?

507
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:21,298
They murdered the last hand.

508
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:23,701
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

509
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:25,569
The king rode for a month

510
00:49:25,604 --> 00:49:27,638
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

511
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:30,307
He's the only one he trusts.

512
00:49:31,776 --> 00:49:34,913
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

513
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:38,048
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

514
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:40,584
He owes him nothing.

515
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,522
Your father and brother
rode south once

516
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:48,424
on a king's demand.

517
00:49:50,227 --> 00:49:52,428
A different time.

518
00:49:53,864 --> 00:49:55,931
A different king.

519
00:50:56,894 --> 00:50:58,695
When do I meet with the Khal?

520
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,597
We need to begin
planning the invasion.

521
00:51:00,632 --> 00:51:03,099
If Khal Drogo has
promised you a crown,

522
00:51:03,133 --> 00:51:05,101
- you shall have it.
- When?

523
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:07,236
When their omens favor war.

524
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,539
I piss on Dothraki omens.

525
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:13,810
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

526
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,139
A Dothraki wedding

527
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:18,710
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

528
00:52:31,256 --> 00:52:33,424
<i>Jadi, zhey Jorah Andahli!</i>

529
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:35,326
<i>Khal vezhven.</i>

530
00:52:41,066 --> 00:52:44,101
A small gift,
for the new khaleesi...

531
00:52:45,337 --> 00:52:47,639
Songs and Histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

532
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:50,741
Thank you, ser.

533
00:52:52,344 --> 00:52:55,079
Are you from my country?

534
00:52:55,113 --> 00:52:57,281
Ser Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

535
00:52:57,316 --> 00:53:00,050
I served your father for many years.

536
00:53:00,084 --> 00:53:03,186
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful king.

537
00:53:26,312 --> 00:53:28,914
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

538
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:31,918
from the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai.

539
00:53:31,952 --> 00:53:34,987
The ages have
turned them to stone,

540
00:53:35,021 --> 00:53:37,123
but they will always be beautiful.

541
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,562
Thank you, magister.

542
00:54:49,364 --> 00:54:51,832
She's beautiful.

543
00:54:55,904 --> 00:54:58,272
Ser Jorah,
I don't know how to say

544
00:54:58,307 --> 00:55:00,141
thank you in Dothraki.

545
00:55:00,176 --> 00:55:03,111
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

546
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,200
Make him happy.

547
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:27,663
No.

548
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,868
Do you know the common tongue?

549
00:56:37,307 --> 00:56:39,341
No.

550
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:45,781
Is "no" the only word that you know?

551
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:48,617
<i>No.</i>

552
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:19,147
Rough night, Imp?

553
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:21,249
If I get through this
without squirting

554
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:23,685
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

555
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:26,087
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

556
00:57:26,121 --> 00:57:29,223
The greatest in the land...
my spear never misses.

557
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,994
It's not hunting
if you pay for it.

558
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:43,404
Are you as good with a
spear as you used to be?

559
00:57:43,438 --> 00:57:45,973
No, but I'm still better than you.

560
00:57:49,044 --> 00:57:50,911
I know what I'm
putting you through.

561
00:57:50,946 --> 00:57:52,947
Thank you for saying yes.

562
00:57:54,382 --> 00:57:56,817
I only ask you
because I need you.

563
00:57:58,019 --> 00:57:59,920
You're a loyal friend.

564
00:57:59,955 --> 00:58:03,257
You hear me?
A <i>loyal</i> friend.

565
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:05,092
The last one I've got.

566
00:58:06,728 --> 00:58:08,896
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

567
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:13,367
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

568
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:17,071
<i>Come on, boys,</i>
<i>let's go kill some boar!</i>

569
00:58:27,015 --> 00:58:29,183
Come on, you.

570
00:59:43,494 --> 00:59:46,028
Stop!

571
00:59:46,063 --> 00:59:47,930
Stop.

572
00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:55,005
Are you completely mad?

573
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,941
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

574
00:59:57,975 --> 00:59:59,843
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

575
00:59:59,877 --> 01:00:02,146
I heard you the first time.

576
01:00:06,118 --> 01:00:08,553
Quite the little climber,
aren't you?

577
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,624
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

578
01:00:12,658 --> 01:00:14,358
10.

579
01:00:23,067 --> 01:00:25,569
The things I do for love.
