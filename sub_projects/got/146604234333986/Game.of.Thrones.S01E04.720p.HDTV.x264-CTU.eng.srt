1
00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:01,691
Tell them all to stop.

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:02,700
For how long?

3
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:04,669
Until I command them
otherwise.

4
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,205
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.

5
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,942
Not a Queen.
A Khaleesi.

6
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,444
( Both shouting )

7
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:13,414
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle

8
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:15,783
spitting down
on the likes of you.

9
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:17,818
Everybody knew
what this place was,

10
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,454
but no one told me--
no one but you.

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,489
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.

12
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:24,859
It is true.
Her belly start to swell.

13
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,429
I need to ride to Qohor.

14
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:29,198
Robert:
What did Aaerys Targaryen say

15
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,535
when you stabbed him
in the back?

16
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:34,005
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours--

17
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,540
"burn them all."

18
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,942
Littlefinger:
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

19
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:40,978
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

20
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:43,549
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

21
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:46,052
I'm leaving this morning.
My job is out there.

22
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,389
- I won't let you down.
- You're not going.

23
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,893
Here, a man gets what he earns
when he earns it.

24
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:55,731
I don't take orders
from savages or their sluts.

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,669
- I don't want my brother harmed.
- ( Coughing )

26
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:03,739
Mormont, kill these
Dothraki dogs!

27
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,210
We've come to a dangerous place.
We must protect ourselves.

28
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:10,746
Ah!

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,414
We allow the Northerners
too much power.

30
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:14,416
A good King knows
when to save his strength

31
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,518
and when to destroy
his enemies.

32
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,787
So you agree...
The Starks are enemies?

33
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:22,324
Everyone who isn't us
is an enemy.

34
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:25,262
- Do you know whose dagger this is?
- Littlefinger: <i>I do.</i>

35
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:27,631
Tyrion Lannister's...

36
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:30,000
<i>The imp.</i>

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,075

<i>( Bird cawing )</i>

41
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:13,921
Nan:
<i>The little lord's</i>
<i>been dreaming again.</i>

42
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,725
( Growling )

43
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,530
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

44
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:26,567
Really?
If I was cooped up all day

45
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:29,670
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

46
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,274
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

47
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:36,310
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

48
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:38,246
But Robb's
Lord of Winterfell,

49
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,416
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

50
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,153
Hodor!

51
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,192
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

52
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,328
<i>Hodor.</i>

53
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:02,972
Tyrion:
I must say I received a slightly
warmer welcome on my last visit.

54
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:05,508
Robb:
Any man of The Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

55
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:08,745
Any man of The Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

56
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,714
I'm not your boy,
Lannister.

57
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,717
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

58
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,254
- Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

59
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,192
So it's true.

60
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:24,295
Hello, Bran.

61
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,664
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

62
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:29,300
He has no memory
of that day.

63
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,768
- Curious.
- Why are you here

64
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:35,971
would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

65
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:39,741
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

66
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:44,980
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

67
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,416
Well, I mean
I <i>did</i> like to.

68
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,686
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

69
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,988
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

70
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:55,059
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

71
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,128
My father will
rejoice to hear it.

72
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:59,764
I have a gift
for you.

73
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,334
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

74
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,938
You must shape
the horse to the rider.

75
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,040
<i>Start with a yearling</i>
<i>and teach it to respond</i>

76
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,008
<i>to the reins</i>
<i>and to the boy's voice.</i>

77
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:13,944
Will I really be
able to ride?

78
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,546
You will.

79
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,914
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

80
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:21,217
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

81
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,952
I have a tender spot
in my heart

82
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:25,889
for cripples, bastards
and broken things.

83
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,026
<i>You've done my brother</i>
<i>a kindness.</i>

84
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,363
The hospitality
of Winterfell is yours.

85
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:34,232
Spare me your false courtesies,
Lord Stark.

86
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:36,468
There's a brothel
outside your walls.

87
00:06:36,502 --> 00:06:39,404
There I'll find a bed and both
of us can sleep easier.

88
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,079
Couldn't resist
some Northern ass?

89
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,882
If you like redheads,
ask for Ros.

90
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,785
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

91
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,354
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

92
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:58,324
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

93
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,326
What happened here?

94
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,728
Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

95
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:05,631
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

96
00:07:05,665 --> 00:07:07,866
- Where did she go?
- My Lady's whereabouts--

97
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,568
My Lady?
( Chuckles )

98
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:13,006
Your loyalty to your captors
is touching.

99
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,242
Tell me, how do you think
balon Greyjoy would feel

100
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:19,211
if he could see his only
surviving son has turned lackey?

101
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,581
I still remember seeing
my father's fleet

102
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,216
burn in Lannisport.

103
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,152
I believe your uncles
were responsible?

104
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,454
Must have been a pretty sight.

105
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,896
Nothing prettier than watching
sailors burn alive.

106
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:33,393
Yes, a great victory
for your people.

107
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:37,131
- Shame how it all turned out.
- We were outnumbered 10 to one--

108
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,200
a stupid rebellion then.

109
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:41,236
I suppose your father
realized that

110
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,772
when your brothers
died in battle.

111
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:47,176
Now here you are,
your enemy's squire.

112
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,044
- Careful, imp.
- I've offended you.

113
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:52,381
Forgive me, it's been
a rough morning.

114
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,817
Anyway, don't despair.

115
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,287
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

116
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,055
and I've learned
to live with it.

117
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,958
- ( Coin clinks )
- Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

118
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:06,261
I'll try not
to wear her out.

119
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:10,598
( Exhales )

120
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,535
Jon:
<i>Shoulder, legs.</i>

121
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:21,509
<i>Leg, shoulder, leg.</i>

122
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,445
<i>Left foot forward.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

123
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,881
Now pivot as you
deliver the stroke.

124
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:28,583
Put all your weight
behind it.

125
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:30,951
What in seven hells
is that?

126
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:33,521
Pyp:
<i>They'll need an eighth hell</i>
<i>to fit him in.</i>

127
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,756
( Laughter )

128
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,725
Tell them
your name.

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,960
Samwell Tarly,

130
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:42,296
of Horn Hill--
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

131
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,268
- I've come to take the black.
- Come to take the black pudding.

132
00:08:47,302 --> 00:08:48,124
( Laughter )

133
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,884
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

134
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,106
Rast...

135
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,342
<i>See what he can do.</i>

136
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,916
( Yelps )

137
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,251
( Whimpers )
I yield.

138
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:08,221
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

139
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,289
Pick up your sword.

140
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,925
Hit him till he
finds his feet.

141
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,861
( Samwell yelping )

142
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,235
<i>( Whimpering )</i>

143
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,704
It seems they've run short of
poachers and thieves down South.

144
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:27,607
- <i>Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.</i>
- Jon!

145
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,210
- <i>Again, harder.</i>
- ( Snarls )

146
00:09:30,244 --> 00:09:32,112
( Shrieks )
I yield!

147
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:33,647
Enough!

148
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:36,950
- <i>( Samwell sobbing )</i>
- <i>He yielded.</i>

149
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,587
Looks like
the bastard's in love.

150
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,291
All right then,
Lord Snow,

151
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:48,561
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

152
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:51,698
You two. Three of you ought
to be sufficient

153
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,033
to make
lady piggy squeal.

154
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:57,136
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

155
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:01,740
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

156
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:18,458
Yield yield yield!
I yield.

157
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:22,229
We're done
for today.

158
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,997
Go clean the armory.

159
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,798
That's all
you're good for.

160
00:10:29,703 --> 00:10:32,438
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

161
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,340
( Spits )

162
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,976
Did he hurt you?

163
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,211
I've had worse.

164
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,049
You can call me Sam...
If you want.

165
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:47,786
- My mother calls me Sam--
- it's not going to get any easier, you know?

166
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,056
You're going to have
to defend yourself.

167
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,991
Why didn't you get up
and fight?

168
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,328
I wanted to.

169
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,731
- <i>I just couldn't.</i>
- Why not?

170
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,602
I'm a coward.

171
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:06,206
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

172
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,308
You're right.
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:11,477
I just... wanted
to thank you.

174
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,190
A bloody coward.

175
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:26,292
People saw us
talking to him.

176
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,461
Now they'll think
we're cowards too.

177
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:30,195
You're too stupid
to be a coward.

178
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,531
- You're too stupid to be a--
- Quick now,

179
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,234
before summer's over.
( Laughing )

180
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:37,469
C'mere!

181
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,239
<i>( Drums playing )</i>

182
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,277
( Horse neighs )

183
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,200
- ( Neighs )
- Hyah hyah!

184
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:15,674
Jorah:
Vaes Dothrak--
the city of the horselords.

185
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:19,445
A pile of mud.

186
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,947
Mud and shit
and twigs--

187
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:24,250
- best these savages can do.
- These are <i>my</i> people now.

188
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,352
You shouldn't
call them savages.

189
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:28,487
I'll call them what I like,
because they're <i>my</i> people.

190
00:12:28,522 --> 00:12:30,856
This is my army.

191
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,292
Khal Drogo is marching the
wrong way with my army.

192
00:12:53,578 --> 00:12:56,847
If my brother <i>was</i> given
an army of Dothraki,

193
00:12:56,881 --> 00:13:00,617
could you conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

194
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:03,353
The Dothraki have never
crossed the Narrow Sea.

195
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:06,023
<i>They fear any water</i>
<i>their horses can't drink.</i>

196
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:08,392
But if they did?

197
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:11,929
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

198
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:14,898
<i>but the men</i>
<i>advising him are different.</i>

199
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:19,135
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

200
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,304
<i>long ago.</i>

201
00:13:21,338 --> 00:13:23,706
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

202
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,509
He drove me
from my land.

203
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,846
You sold slaves.

204
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:33,449
Aye.

205
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:37,320
- Why?
- I had no money

206
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:39,856
and an expensive wife.

207
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,725
And where is she now?

208
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,693
In another place,

209
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:46,163
with another man.

210
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,571
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

211
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:57,374
They call you
the Last Dragon...

212
00:13:57,408 --> 00:14:00,110
They do.

213
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,548
You have dragon's blood

214
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,483
in your veins?

215
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,552
It's entirely possible.

216
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:11,156
( Chuckles )
What happened to the dragons?

217
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,859
I was told that brave men
killed them all.

218
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:20,232
The brave men
didn't kill dragons.

219
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,035
The brave men
rode them.

220
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,473
Rode them from Valyria
to build the greatest civilization

221
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:30,043
this world
has ever seen.

222
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,412
The breath
of the greatest dragon

223
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:34,448
forged the Iron Throne,

224
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:37,251
which the usurper is
keeping warm for me.

225
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,088
The swords
of the vanquished,

226
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,923
a thousand of them...

227
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:48,328
Melted together
like so many candles.

228
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:54,733
I have always wanted
to see a dragon.

229
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:59,270
There is nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

230
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,472
Really.
Why dragons?

231
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:04,208
They can fly.

232
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:07,346
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

233
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,982
and they're
somewhere else...

234
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:12,151
Far away.

235
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,957
And they can kill.

236
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,562
Anyone or anything that
tries to hurt them

237
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:26,600
- gets burned away to nothing...
- ( Gasps )

238
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,203
...Like so many candles.

239
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:31,404
Ow.

240
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,342
Yes.
Seeing a dragon

241
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:38,310
would make me very happy.

242
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:40,913
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

243
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:43,148
I imagine just seeing
the sky makes you happy.

244
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,251
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

245
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,254
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

246
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:52,058
A man from Asshai with a dagger
of real dragonglass.

247
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:54,228
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

248
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:58,667
change his face the way that
other men change their clothes.

249
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:02,705
And I've seen a pirate
who wore his weight in gold

250
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:06,875
and whose ship had
sails of colored silk.

251
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:11,347
So...

252
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,549
Have you seen one?

253
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,086
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

254
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,088
No.

255
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:23,593
No, the last one died many years
before I was born.

256
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:26,962
I'll tell you
what I have seen:

257
00:16:26,997 --> 00:16:29,565
Their skulls.

258
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,736
They used to decorate
the throne room in the Red Keep.

259
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,172
When I was very young,
just three or four,

260
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:37,408
my father used
to walk me down the rows

261
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,176
and I'd recite
their names for him.

262
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,047
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

263
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:46,851
The ones closest to the door were
the last ones they were able to hatch

264
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,686
and they were all
stunted and wrong.

265
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,990
Skulls no bigger
than dog skulls.

266
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:56,962
But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

267
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:00,332
They got bigger

268
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,435
and bigger and bigger.

269
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,740
There was Ghiscar

270
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,343
and Valryon,

271
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:13,144
Vermithrax,

272
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,513
Essovius--
( Gasps )

273
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:18,049
Archonei,

274
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,052
Meraxes,

275
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:24,555
Vhagar...

276
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:28,961
- And Balerion the dread...
- ( Moans )

277
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:31,563
...Whose fire forged

278
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:33,700
the Seven Kingdoms

279
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,969
into one.

280
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,177
What happened
to the skulls?

281
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,048
I don't know.

282
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:50,384
The usurper had them
smashed to powder, I expect.

283
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:53,488
Scattered to the wind.

284
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,226
That's very sad.

285
00:17:59,261 --> 00:18:01,095
Yes, it is.

286
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:04,898
What did I buy you for?

287
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:08,001
- To make me sad?
- No, your Grace.

288
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:12,438
To, uh, teach your sister.

289
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:14,873
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

290
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:18,810
You think I bought you to make
<i>Khal Drogo</i> happy?

291
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,252
Oh, you pretty
little idiot.

292
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:28,254
( Chuckles )

293
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,423
Go on then.
Get on with it.

294
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,935
Someday your husband
will sit there

295
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,237
and you will sit
by his side.

296
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:50,410
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

297
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:53,012
All the Lords of Westeros

298
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,782
will gather here to see
the little prince--

299
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,617
what if I have a girl?

300
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:00,587
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

301
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:03,222
What if I <i>only</i>
have girls?

302
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:05,392
I wouldn't worry
about that.

303
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:08,494
Jeyne Poole's mother had five children--
all of them girls.

304
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:10,630
Yes, but it's
highly unlikely.

305
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:13,166
But what if?

306
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,402
Well, if you only
had girls,

307
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:20,006
I suppose the throne would
pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

308
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,976
And everyone
would hate me.

309
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,111
Nobody could ever
hate you.

310
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:27,648
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

311
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:30,717
Why would you say
such a thing?

312
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:34,321
That business with the wolves?
Sansa,

313
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:36,757
I've told you
a hundred times:

314
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,526
- A direwolf is not--
- please shut up about it.

315
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,729
Do you remember
your lessons?

316
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:47,301
Who built the Iron Throne?

317
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,403
Aegon the Conqueror.

318
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:51,472
And who built
the Red Keep?

319
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,073
Maegor the Cruel.

320
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,975
And how many years
did it take to build--

321
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:58,045
my grandfather and Uncle
were murdered here, weren't they?

322
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,782
They were killed on the orders of
King Aerys, yes.

323
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:07,120
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

324
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,588
Why were they killed?

325
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,858
You should be speak to your
father about these matters.

326
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,893
I don't want to speak
to my father-- ever.

327
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:19,397
Sansa, you will
find it in your heart

328
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,932
to forgive your father.

329
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,733
No, I won't.

330
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,035
Man:
It's The Hand's
tournament that's causing

331
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,738
- all this trouble, My Lords.
- The <i>King's</i> tournament.

332
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:31,408
I assure you The Hand
wants no part of it.

333
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,677
Call it what you will,
Lord Stark, Ser,

334
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:36,980
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

335
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:40,183
Last night we had a tavern riot,
a brothel fire,

336
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:43,120
<i>three stabbings and a drunken horse race</i>
<i>down the Street of Sisters.</i>

337
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,989
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the King's peace,

338
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:49,059
perhaps the city watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

339
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,794
- I need more men.
- Ned: <i>You'll get 50.</i>

340
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:53,764
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

341
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:55,499
You found money
for a champion's purse,

342
00:20:55,533 --> 00:20:57,434
<i>you can find money</i>
<i>to keep the peace.</i>

343
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,305
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

344
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:03,139
<i>till the crowds</i>
<i>have left.</i>

345
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:04,808
Thank you,
My Lord Hand, Ser.

346
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:06,576
They will be put
to good use.

347
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,847
The sooner this is over,
the better.

348
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:13,850
The realm prospers
from such events, My Lord.

349
00:21:13,884 --> 00:21:16,052
They give the great
a chance at glory,

350
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:18,354
and the lowly a respite
from their woes.

351
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:20,824
Littlefinger:
<i>And every inn in</i>
<i>the city is full</i>

352
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,892
and the whores
are walking bow-legged.

353
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,395
I'm sure the tourney
puts coins in many a pocket.

354
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,964
- Hmmm.
- Now...

355
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:30,567
If there's nothing else,
My Lords?

356
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:42,612
Oh, this heat.

357
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:45,448
On days like this,
I envy you Northerners

358
00:21:45,483 --> 00:21:47,217
your summer snows.

359
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,265
Until tomorrow, My Lord--

360
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,662
I've been hoping to talk
to you about Jon Arryn.

361
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:53,723
Lord Arryn?

362
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:55,925
Oh, his death was

363
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,694
a great sadness
to all of us.

364
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:00,963
I took personal charge
of his care,

365
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:03,666
but I could not
save him.

366
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,969
His sickness struck him

367
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:09,439
very hard and very fast.

368
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:12,009
I saw him in my chambers

369
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:13,978
just the night
before he passed.

370
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:17,181
Lord Jon often came
to me for counsel.

371
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,952
Why?

372
00:22:19,986 --> 00:22:23,555
( Offended )
I have been Grand Maester
for many years.

373
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:27,025
Kings and Hands have come to me
for advice since--

374
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,962
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

375
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,431
Oh, he came inquiring
after a book.

376
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,200
A book?

377
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:35,868
What book?

378
00:22:35,902 --> 00:22:37,603
Oh, I fear

379
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,407
it would be of little interest
to you, My Lord.

380
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:42,909
A ponderous Tome.

381
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,513
No, I'd like to read it.

382
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,519
"The Lineages and Histories

383
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:54,723
of the Great H
of the Seven Kingdoms,

384
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:58,427
with descriptions
of many high lords

385
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,564
and noble ladies

386
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:03,732
and their children."

387
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:23,316
"Harkon Umber,
first of his name,

388
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,153
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

389
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:29,722
in the 183rd year
after Aegon's landing,

390
00:23:29,757 --> 00:23:33,060
at the last hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

391
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:36,597
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

392
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,867
of a wound sustained
in a bear hunt."

393
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:42,671
As I said, My Lord,
a ponderous read.

394
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:45,540
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

395
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:48,343
He did not, My Lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

396
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:51,011
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

397
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,380
...Did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

398
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:55,215
Nothing of import,
My Lord.

399
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:58,051
Oh-- there was one phrase

400
00:23:58,085 --> 00:23:59,919
he kept repeating:

401
00:23:59,953 --> 00:24:03,422
"The seed is strong,"
I think it was.

402
00:24:03,457 --> 00:24:05,759
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mm.

403
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:08,028
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

404
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:11,165
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

405
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,701
For all the weight
they're given,

406
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,804
last words are usually

407
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,907
as significant
as first words.

408
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:20,876
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

409
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:23,212
What else could it be?

410
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:25,748
Poison.

411
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,451
A disturbing thought.

412
00:24:28,485 --> 00:24:30,653
No no no, I don't
think it likely.

413
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:33,088
The Hand
was loved by all.

414
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,124
What sort of man
would dare--

415
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,027
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

416
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:40,529
Yes, women,

417
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,464
cravens...

418
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:45,166
And eunuchs.

419
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:48,604
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

420
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,105
Everybody knows that.

421
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:52,374
Yes yes, of course.

422
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,844
How that sort of <i>person</i>
found himself

423
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:58,513
on the King's Council,
I will never know.

424
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:00,248
I've taken enough
of your time.

425
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:02,885
No trouble at all, My Lord.
It's a great honor--

426
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,653
thank you.

427
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:06,622
I'll find my own way out.

428
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,870
<i>( Footsteps approaching )</i>

429
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:31,183
Syrio says a water dancer

430
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:32,917
can stand on one toe
for hours.

431
00:25:32,952 --> 00:25:35,754
It's a hard fall
down these steps.

432
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,756
Syrio says every hurt
is a lesson

433
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,992
and every lesson
makes you better.

434
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:44,530
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats?

435
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:46,065
Syrio says.

436
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:48,167
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

437
00:25:48,202 --> 00:25:51,238
They're quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

438
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:53,540
You have to be
quick to catch them.

439
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:55,410
He's right about that.

440
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:56,878
Now that Bran's awake

441
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:59,715
will he come
live with us?

442
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:04,687
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

443
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:07,189
He wants to be
a knight of the Kingsguard.

444
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:11,594
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

445
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,564
But someday

446
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,900
he could be
Lord of a Holdfast

447
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:20,168
or sit on
the King's Council.

448
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,605
Or he might raise castles

449
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:25,173
like Brandon the builder.

450
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,943
Can I be Lord
of a Holdfast?

451
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:30,145
( Chuckles )

452
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:35,316
You will marry
a high lord

453
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,351
and rule his castle.

454
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:39,752
And your sons
shall be knights

455
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,388
and princes and lords.

456
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:46,459
Hmm?
- No.

457
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:49,862
That's not me.

458
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:02,042
<i>( Wind gusting )</i>

459
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:14,121
Hello.

460
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:18,225
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new Watch partner.

461
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:21,929
I should warn you,

462
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:24,832
I don't see
all that well.

463
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,002
Come stand by the fire.

464
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:31,606
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

465
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,008
You're not.
You're freezing.

466
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:48,790
I don't like
high places.

467
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,559
You can't fight.

468
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,361
You can't see.

469
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:55,732
You're afraid of heights
and almost everything else probably.

What are you
doing here, Sam?

471

On the morning of my 18th Nameday,
my father came to me.

472
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,048
"You're almost
a man now," he said...

473
00:28:12,384 --> 00:28:15,619
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

474
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:19,190
Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

475
00:28:19,224 --> 00:28:22,526
forsake all claim to your
inheritance and start North.

476
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,964
If you do not,"
he said...

477
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:30,133
"Then we'll have a hunt

478
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:33,203
and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

479
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:36,073
and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

480
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:41,111
Or so I'll tell
your mother.

481
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,313
Nothing would
please me more."

482
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:51,588
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

483
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,892
- Yes, he is.
- ( Moans )

484
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:57,695
I'm not going to get
any better, you know?

485
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,032
Well...

486
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,867
You can't get any worse.

487
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,704
( Chuckling )

488
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:15,444
I hear you're reading
a boring book.

489
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:17,279
Hmph.

490
00:29:17,314 --> 00:29:19,448
Pycelle talks too much.

491
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:21,383
Oh, he never stops.

492
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,918
Do you know Ser Hugh
of the Vale?

493
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,455
Not surprising.
Until recently,

494
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,025
he was only a squire--
Jon Arryn's squire.

495
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,027
He was knighted
almost immediately

496
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,463
after his master's
untimely death.

497
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:37,799
Knighted for what?

498
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,401
Why are you
telling me this?

499
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:42,136
I promised cat
that I'd help you.

500
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,638
Where is Ser Hugh?

501
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:47,574
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

502
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:49,776
Do you see
that boy there?

503
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:52,445
( Whispers )
One of Varys's little birds.

504
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,282
The spider has taken a great
interest in your comings and goings.

505
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,217
Now look there.

506
00:29:58,252 --> 00:30:00,986
That one belongs
to the Queen.

507
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,156
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

508
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,058
Varys or the Queen?

509
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:09,794
No, she's one
of mine.

510
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:14,731
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

511
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,236
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, My Lord.

512
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,274
Get a message to
this paragon of yours--

513
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:27,477
discreetly--
send him to question Ser Hugh.

514
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:31,749
After that, you might want him
to visit a certain armorer in the city.

515
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:35,386
He lives in a large house at the top
of the Street of Steel.

516
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,822
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

517
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,358
and it's possible
that they saw Lord Arryn

518
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:44,296
visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.

519
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:48,933
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
wrong to distrust you.

520
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,835
Distrusting me was
the wisest thing

521
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,471
you've done since you climbed
off your horse.

522
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:03,079
- <i>( Hammering )</i>
- ...Two, three,

523
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,914
24, five,

524
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:07,250
six, 27,

525
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,285
- 28, 29--
- Ser Hugh?

526
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,988
30, 31, 32

527
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:13,290
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

528
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:16,260
I'm here on behalf
of Lord Eddard Stark,

529
00:31:16,295 --> 00:31:18,563
the Hand of the King.

530
00:31:18,597 --> 00:31:19,997
I'm the Captain
of his guard.

531
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:22,200
I'm sorry, I didn't catch
your name, Ser...

532
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:24,903
No "Ser."
I'm not a knight.

533
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:28,239
I see. Well, it just
so happens that I am.

534
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:32,943
( Continues counting )

535
00:31:32,977 --> 00:31:35,946
Jory:
He said he'd be glad
to talk to the hand himself.

536
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,814
He's a <i>knight,</i>
you see.

537
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:39,582
Ah, a knight.

538
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:42,484
They strut around
like roosters down here.

539
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,188
<i>Even the ones who've never seen</i>
<i>an arrow coming their way.</i>

540
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:48,090
You shouldn't be
out here, My Lord.

541
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:51,560
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

542
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:56,398
The former Hand did call on me,
My Lord, several times.

543
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:59,768
I regret to say he did not honor me
with his patronage.

544
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:02,337
What did
Lord Arryn want?

545
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:04,439
He always came to see the boy.

546
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:06,375
I'd like to see him
as well.

547
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,745
As you Gendry! My lord.

548
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,116
Here he is.

549
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,785
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

550
00:32:18,819 --> 00:32:21,955
Show the hand
the helmet you made, lad.

551
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:38,573
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

552
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:40,508
Boy, this is
the King's Hand!

553
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,946
- If his lordship wants the helm--
- I made it for me.

554
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,615
- Forgive him, My Lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

555
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:50,852
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

556
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,388
He just asked me questions
is all, My Lord.

557
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:55,590
What kind
of questions?

558
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,994
About my work at first,

559
00:33:00,028 --> 00:33:03,631
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

560
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:07,602
But then he started
asking me about my mother.

561
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:12,039
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

562
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,809
What did you tell him?

563
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:18,580
She died when I was little.

564
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:20,848
She had yellow hair.

565
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:23,518
She'd sing to me sometimes.

566
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,291
Look at me.

567
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:40,937
Get back to work, lad.

568
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,674
If the day ever comes
when that boy

569
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,876
would rather wield
a sword than forge one,

570
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,311
<i>you send him to me.</i>

571
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:51,648
<i>( Hammer banging )</i>

572
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:56,118
Find anything?

573
00:33:57,154 --> 00:33:59,955
King Robert's
bastard son.

574
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,291
<i>( Robert laughing )</i>

575
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:05,027
- Woman: <i>He likes that.</i>
- <i>( Women laughing )</i>

576
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,366
This is for the King
from Lord Stark.

577
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,635
- <i>( Robert laughs )</i>
- Should I leave it with--

578
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,404
shhh.

579
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:15,273
Listen.

580
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:18,043
Do you hear them?

581
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:22,581
How many do you think
are in there with him?

582
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,416
Huh?

583
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,251
- <i>Guess.</i>
- Three?

584
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:28,586
- <i>( Laughter )</i>
- Four.

585
00:34:30,288 --> 00:34:32,557
He likes to do this
when I'm on duty--

586
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:35,159
he makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

587
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:39,396
- ( Door opens )
- <i>( Laughter )</i>

588
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:41,689
Forgive me, My Lord--

589
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:43,715
Why do I have to forgive you?
Have you wronged me?

590
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:48,038
We've met before, you know.

591
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:51,042
Have we?
Strange, I've forgotten.

592
00:34:51,076 --> 00:34:54,513
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.

593
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:56,348
Ah.

594
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:58,417
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

595
00:34:58,451 --> 00:34:59,852
Oh.

596
00:34:59,887 --> 00:35:01,721
One of the Greyjoys
nearly took my eye.

597
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:04,725
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

598
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,927
<i>They stopped liking it</i>
<i>at the end.</i>

599
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:10,964
That was a proper battle.
Do you remember

600
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:14,034
Thoros of Myr charging
through the breach?

601
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,602
With his burning sword?

602
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:17,505
I'll remember that
till the day I die.

603
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:21,376
I saw the youngest of the
Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

604
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,778
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

605
00:35:23,812 --> 00:35:26,080
Theon?
He's a good lad.

606
00:35:26,115 --> 00:35:27,215
I doubt it.

607

<i>- ( Laughter )</i>
<i>- ( Door opens )</i>

<i>Let me smell it.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>

610
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,530
Can I leave this
with you?

611
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:42,199
The message
from Lord Stark.

612
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:44,568
I don't serve Lord Stark.

613
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,805
<i>( Laughter continues )</i>

- Watch duty.

00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,527
- With Sam.
- Ah, prince porkchop.

616
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:14,696
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

- Impossible!

Sam's no different
from the rest of us.

There was no place
for him in the world,

so he's come here.

622

We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

623

Never again,
no matter what Thorne says.

He's our brother now

00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:44,259
( Laughter )

627
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:47,262
You girls can do
as you please.

628
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:50,132
But if Thorne puts me
up against lady piggy,

629
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,234
I'm gonna slice me off
a side of bacon.

630
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:54,570

- ( Panting )
- ( Growling )

633
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:17,996
No one touches Sam.

<i>( Growling continues )</i>

636
00:37:32,278 --> 00:37:34,613
What are you
waiting for?

637
00:37:44,524 --> 00:37:46,925
Attack him!

638
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:58,136
You get in there.

639
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,608
( Softly )
Hit me.

640
00:38:05,811 --> 00:38:07,812
Go on, hit me!

641
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:09,714
( Shouts )

642
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:12,350
- <i>I yield!</i>
- <i>( Laughter )</i>

643
00:38:12,384 --> 00:38:14,352
Yield yield.

644
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:16,620
<i>I yield.</i>

645
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:22,493
You think this
is funny, do you?

646
00:38:25,598 --> 00:38:27,098
When you're out there

647
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,834
beyond The Wall
with the sun going down,

648
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:32,304
do you want
a man at your back?

649
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:34,640
Or a sniveling boy?

650
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:44,584
( Sobbing )

651
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:51,857
You send this whore
to give me commands?

652
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:54,426
I should have sent
you back her head!

653
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,361
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

654
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:57,996
Hush now.
It's all right.

655
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:01,333
- Irri, take her and leave us.
- <i>Yes, Khaleesi.</i>

656
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:07,739
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

657
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:09,374
You do not command me.

658
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:11,175
I wasn't commanding you.

659
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,010
I just wanted to invite
you to supper.

660
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:15,313
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

661
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:18,283
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

662
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,351
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

663
00:39:20,386 --> 00:39:22,420
This stinks of manure.
All of it.

664
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:24,826
( Gasps ) Stop-- stop it.

665
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,321
You would turn me into one
of them, wouldn't you?

666
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,992
Next you'll want
to braid my hair.

667
00:39:28,026 --> 00:39:30,060
You've no right
to a braid.

668
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:31,561
You've won
no victories yet.

669
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:34,731
You do not
talk back to me!

670
00:39:36,033 --> 00:39:38,534
You are a horselord's slut.

671
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:40,503
And now you've woken
the dragon--

672
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:43,472
- ( metal jangles )
- ( Screams )

673
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:49,713
I am a Khaleesi
of the Dothraki!

674
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:52,116
I am the wife
of the great Khal

675
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,919
and I carry his son
inside me.

676
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:58,723
The next time
you raise a hand to me

677
00:39:58,757 --> 00:40:01,993
will be the last time
you have hands.

678
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:06,031
<i>( Thunder rumbles,</i>
<i>rain pattering )</i>

679
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:11,703
I know for a fact
that some of the officers

680
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:13,705
go to that brothel
in mole's town.

681
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,540
I wouldn't doubt it.

682
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:18,009
Don't you think it's
a little bit unfair?

683
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,178
Making us take our vows
while they sneak off

684
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:22,813
for a little
sally on the side?

685
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:25,616
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

686
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,987
What, we can't defend
the wall unless we're celibate?

687
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:30,844
It's absurd.

688
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,923
I didn't think you'd be
so upset about it.

689
00:40:34,327 --> 00:40:36,595
Why not?

690
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:39,090
- Because I'm fat?
- No.

691
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:42,210
But I like girls just
as much as you do.

692
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:45,906
They might not
like me as much.

693
00:40:47,842 --> 00:40:51,111
I've never--
been with one.

694
00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:54,381
You've probably
had hundreds.

695
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:56,083
No.

696
00:40:58,386 --> 00:41:00,921
As a matter of fact,

697
00:41:00,956 --> 00:41:02,389
I'm the same as you.

698
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,424
( Scoffs )
Yeah.

699
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,660
I find that hard
to believe.

700
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:08,996
I came very close once.

701
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,465
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but--

702
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,801
you didn't know
where to put it?

703
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:16,869
I know where to put it.

704
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,938
Was she...

705
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:21,107
Old and ugly?

706
00:41:22,142 --> 00:41:23,909
Young and gorgeous.

707
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:27,446
A whore named Ros.

708
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:31,216
What color hair?

709
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,085
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

710
00:41:35,654 --> 00:41:37,421
And her, um...

711
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:39,156
Her...

712
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:41,858
- You don't want to know.
- That good?

713
00:41:41,893 --> 00:41:43,660
- Better.
- Oh no.

714
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:47,999
So why exactly

715
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:51,736
did you not make love
to Ros with the perfect--?

716
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,239
What's my name?

717
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:56,175
Jon Snow?

718
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:59,512
And why is
my surname snow?

719
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:02,349
Because...

720
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:04,951
You're a bastard
from the North.

721
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,022
I never met my mother.

722
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:12,024
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

723
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:14,694
I don't know if she's
living or dead.

724
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:19,164
I don't know
if she's a noblewoman

725
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,833
or a Fisherman's wife...

726
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:24,536
Or a whore.

727
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:29,141
So I sat there

728
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:32,378
in the brothel as Ros
took off her clothes.

729
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:35,982
But I couldn't do it.

730
00:42:36,016 --> 00:42:39,019
Because all I could
think was

731
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:41,722
what if I got her pregnant

732
00:42:41,756 --> 00:42:43,791
and she had a child,

733
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:46,760
another bastard named Snow?

734
00:42:51,299 --> 00:42:54,135
It's not a good life
for a child.

735
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:56,370
Ah, mmm.

736
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:01,008
So...

737
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:03,444
You didn't know
where to put it?

738
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:06,180
( Laughing )

739
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:11,252
<i>Enjoying yourselves?</i>

740
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:15,190
You look cold, boys.

741
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:16,924
( Door creaks )

742
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,493
It is a bit nippy.

743
00:43:18,527 --> 00:43:20,929
A bit nippy,
yeah, by the fire,

744
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:25,100
indoors.
It's still summer.

745
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,971
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

746
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,775
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

747
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:34,910
I remember.

748
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,646
Was it uncomfortable
at Winterfell?

749
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:40,316
Were there days when
you just couldn't get warm,

750
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,185
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

751
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,421
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

752
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:50,625
I spent six months out there,
beyond The Wall

753
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,562
<i>during the last winter.</i>

754
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:56,699
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

755
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:00,169
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

756
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,573
So we went out to look
for some of his men--

757
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,509
capture them,
gather some knowledge.

758
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:09,512
The Wildlings who fight
for Mance Rayder are hard men.

759
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:12,581
Harder than you'll ever be.

760
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:15,050
They know their country
better than we do.

761
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,420
They knew there was
a storm coming in.

762
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,724
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

763
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,694
And we got caught
in the open.

764
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:28,030
Wind so strong

765
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:30,566
it yanked 100-foot trees
straight from the ground,

766
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,069
<i>roots and all.</i>
<i>If you took your gloves off</i>

767
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,104
<i>to find your cock</i>
<i>to have a piss,</i>

768
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,440
you lost a finger
to the frost.

769
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,808
And all in darkness.

770
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:45,514
You don't know cold.

771
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:47,949
Neither of you do.

772
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:52,721
The horses died first.

773
00:44:54,557 --> 00:44:57,659
We didn't have enough to feed them,
to keep them warm.

774
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:02,364
Eating the horses was easy.

775
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:07,435
But later when <i>we</i>
started to fall...

776
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:11,439
That wasn't easy.

777
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:15,008
We should have had a couple of
boys like you along, shouldn't we?

778
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:20,713
- ( Grabs )
- ( Gasps )

779
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:22,982
Soft, fat boys like you.

780
00:45:23,017 --> 00:45:25,486
We'd have lasted
a fortnight on you

781
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,556
and still had bones
leftover for soup.

782
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:34,062
Soon we'll have
new recruits

783
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:37,132
and you lot will be passed along
to the Lord Commander

784
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:39,301
for assignment

785
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:43,272
and they will call you
men of The Night's Watch,

786
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,041
but you'd be fools
to believe it.

787
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,478
<i>You're boys still.</i>

788
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:52,614
<i>And come the winter</i>
<i>you will die...</i>

789
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,750
Like flies.

790
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:04,825
I hit him.

791
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,760
I hit the dragon.

792
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:09,230
Your brother Rhaegar
was the Last Dragon.

793
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:12,167
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

794
00:46:12,201 --> 00:46:14,069
He is still
the true king.

795
00:46:14,103 --> 00:46:16,104
The truth now:

796
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:19,408
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

797
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,944
No.

798
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:24,880
But the common people
are waiting for him.

799
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:29,251
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
banners and praying for his return.

800
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:33,421
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

801
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:36,924
They don't care what games
the high lords play.

802
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:39,793
What do you pray for,
Ser Jorah?

803
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:46,833
Home.

804
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:49,035
I pray for home too.

805
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:55,509
My brother will never take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

806
00:46:57,178 --> 00:47:00,481
He couldn't lead an army
even if my husband gave him one.

807
00:47:03,852 --> 00:47:06,287
He'll never take us home.

808
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:09,624
<i>( Crowd chattering )</i>

809
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:28,109
Lover's quarrel?

810
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:29,945
I'm sorry.
Do I...?

811
00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:33,082
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
He's known--

812
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:34,617
an old friend
of the family.

813
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:37,855
I've known your mother
a long long time.

814
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,190
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

815
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:43,193
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

816
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,863
When I was a child
I was very small

817
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:49,766
and I come from a little spit of land
called The Fingers,

818
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,568
so you see,

819
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,669
it's an exceedingly
clever nickname.

820
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,238
I've been sitting here
for days!

821
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,273
Start the damn joust

822
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,242
before I piss myself!

823
00:48:03,712 --> 00:48:05,980
( Cheering )

824
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:10,352
Gods, who is that?

825
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:12,888
Littlefinger:
<i>Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

826
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,025
<i>They call him the Mountain.</i>

827
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,130
<i>The hound's older brother.</i>

828
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:23,133
- And his opponent?
- Littlefinger: Ser Hugh of the Vale.

829
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:25,569
<i>He was</i>
<i>Jon Arryn's squire.</i>

830
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,270
<i>Lo how far he's come.</i>

831
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:29,539
Yes yes, enough
of the bloody pomp.

832
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,040
Have at it!

833
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,418
( Horse neighs )

834
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,252
( Screams )

835
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:16,689
( Crowd gasps )

836
00:49:16,723 --> 00:49:19,925
( Gurgling )

837
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,095
Not what you
were expecting?

838
00:49:56,933 --> 00:50:00,702
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

839
00:50:01,905 --> 00:50:04,340
Lovely little tale
of brotherly love.

840
00:50:05,775 --> 00:50:08,644
The Hound was just a pup,

841
00:50:08,678 --> 00:50:11,079
six years old maybe.

842
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:13,315
Gregor a few years older--

843
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:16,785
already a big lad, already
getting a bit of a reputation.

844
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:19,254
Some lucky boys

845
00:50:19,288 --> 00:50:22,457
<i>just born with a talent</i>
<i>for violence.</i>

846
00:50:23,826 --> 00:50:27,129
<i>One evening Gregor found</i>
<i>his little brother</i>

847
00:50:27,163 --> 00:50:29,799
<i>playing with a toy</i>
<i>by the fire--</i>

848
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:32,034
<i>Gregor's toy,</i>

849
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:34,470
a wooden knight.

850
00:50:34,504 --> 00:50:36,972
Gregor never said a word,

851
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:39,775
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

852
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,012
<i>and shoved his face</i>
<i>into the burning coals.</i>

853
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:45,281
<i>Held him there</i>

854
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:47,283
<i>while the boy screamed,</i>

855
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:49,718
<i>while his face melted.</i>

856
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,592
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

857
00:50:56,627 --> 00:50:59,295
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

858
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:01,230
No, please don't.

859
00:51:01,265 --> 00:51:03,699
If the Hound so much as
heard you mention it,

860
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:06,735
I'm afraid all the knights
in King's Landing

861
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:09,104
would not be able
to save you.

862
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:21,714
( Knocks )

863
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:24,850
My Lord,
her Grace the Queen.

864
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,522
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

865
00:51:30,556 --> 00:51:33,124
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

866
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:38,363
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us--

867
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:40,632
the ugliness
with the wolves.

868
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:45,404
And forcing you to kill
the beast was extreme.

869
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,143
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

870
00:51:51,578 --> 00:51:53,379
How is Sansa?

871
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:55,315
She likes it here.

872
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:57,083
<i>She's the only</i>
<i>Stark who does.</i>

873
00:51:57,118 --> 00:51:59,619
Favors her mother,

874
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,421
not much
of the North in her.

875
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:04,858
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

876
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:07,060
What is it you
hope to accomplish?

877
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:10,163
The King called on me
to serve him and the realm,

878
00:52:10,198 --> 00:52:12,932
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

879
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:15,434
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

880
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:18,037
He'll do what he wants, which is
all he's ever done.

881
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:21,039
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

882
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:23,809
If that's my job,
then so be it.

883
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:27,747
You're just a soldier,
aren't you?

884
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:30,516
You take your orders
and you carry on.

885
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:33,719
I suppose it makes sense.

886
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:37,090
Your older brother was trained to
lead and you were trained to follow.

887
00:52:37,124 --> 00:52:40,092
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, your Grace.

888
00:52:43,531 --> 00:52:45,632
As was I.

889
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:54,007
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

890
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,745

00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:02,281
<i>( Dog barking )</i>

892

Seven blessings to you,

893
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:07,853
And to you.

894
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:09,854
Boy!
Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

895
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,290
Ah, good idea, grandfather.
I'm starving.

896
00:53:12,324 --> 00:53:14,125
A song
while we wait or--?

897
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,960
I'd rather throw myself
down a well.

898
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:19,630
Now now, grandfather, this may be your
last chance if you're heading North.

899
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:22,667
The only music the Northerners know is
the howling of wolves!

900
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:24,736
<i>- ( Laughs )</i>
<i>- ( Door opens )</i>

901
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,437
Gods.

902
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:27,972
I'm sorry, My Lord.
We're full up.

903
00:53:28,006 --> 00:53:31,008
- <i>Every room.</i>
- Tyrion: <i>My men can sleep in the stable.</i>

904
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:33,678
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

905
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:36,881
Truly, My Lord,
we have nothing.

906
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:39,250
Is there nothing I can do...

907
00:53:39,284 --> 00:53:41,853
- ( Coin clanks )
- ...To remedy this?

908
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,755
You can have my room.

909
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:45,323
Now there's
a clever man.

910
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:49,961
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

911
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:52,097
- Aye, My Lord.
- My Lord of Lannister!

912
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:54,232
Might I entertain you
while you eat?

913
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:57,168
I can sing of your father's victory
at King's Landing!

914
00:53:57,202 --> 00:53:59,836
Nothing would more likely
ruin my supper.

915
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,472
Lady Stark!

916
00:54:02,506 --> 00:54:05,208
<i>What an unexpected</i>
<i>pleasure.</i>

917
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,778
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

918
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:10,680
Lady Stark!

919
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:20,690
I was still Catelyn Tully

920
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:23,226
the last time
I stayed here.

921
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:28,365
You, Ser,

922
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:32,636
is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

923
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,705
It is, My Lady.

924
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:37,575
And is Lady Whent
a true and honest friend

925
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,413
to my father, Lord Hoster Tully
of Riverrun?

926
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,216
She is.

927
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:48,721
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

928
00:54:48,755 --> 00:54:50,957
My father counts
Jonas Bracken

amongst his oldest
and most loyal bannermen.

930
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:55,995
Our lord is honored
by his trust.

931
00:54:56,029 --> 00:54:58,331
I envy your father

932
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,032
all his fine friends,
Lady Stark,

933
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:03,136
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

934
00:55:04,938 --> 00:55:07,006
I know your sigil as well--

935
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,710
the Twin Towers
of Frey.

936
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:13,013
How fares your lord, Ser?

937
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:15,015
Lord Walder is well,
My Lady.

938
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:17,851
<i>He has asked your father</i>
<i>for the honor of his presence</i>

940
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:21,755
- He plans to take another wife.
- ( Scoffs )

941
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:30,932
This man

942
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:33,301
came into my house
as a guest

943
00:55:33,335 --> 00:55:37,237
and there conspired
to murder my son,

944
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:40,775
a boy of 10.

945
00:55:42,377 --> 00:55:45,646
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

946
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:48,449
I call upon you
to seize him

947
00:55:48,483 --> 00:55:52,053
and help me return him
to Winterfell

948
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:54,122
to await the King's Justice.

949
