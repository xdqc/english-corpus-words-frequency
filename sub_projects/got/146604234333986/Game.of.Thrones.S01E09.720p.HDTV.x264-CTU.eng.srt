<i>Varys: You've seen
better days, My Lord.</i>

6
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:12,803
Another visit?

7
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,572
It seems
you're my last friend.

8
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:19,375
No no,
many still love you.

9
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,677
Sansa came to court
this morning

10
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,846
to plead for your life.

11
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,649
On her knees,
begging for me, hmmm.

12
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,651
Did you laugh
with the others?

13
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,486
You do me wrong, My Lord.

14
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,721
Your blood is
the last thing I want.

15
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,556
I don't know
what you want.

16
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,524
I've given up
trying to guess.

17
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,996
When I was still a boy--

18
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,233
before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife--

19
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,570
I traveled with a group
of actors through the free cities.

20
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,141
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

21
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,077
The same is true
at court.

22
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,446
I am the master
of whisperers.

23
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,349
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

24
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,785
I'm a good actor,
My Lord.

25
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:11,321
Huh.
Can you free me from this pit?

26
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,088
I could.

27
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:14,756
But will I?

28
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,424
No.

29
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,292
As I said,
I'm no hero.

30
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:21,360
What do you want?
Tell me.

31
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:24,361
No riddles, no stories--
tell me, what do you want?

32
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:28,063
Peace.

33
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:30,898
Did you know that
your son is marching south

34
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:34,000
with an army of Northmen?
Loyal lad--

35
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,670
fighting for
his father's freedom.

36
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:38,938
Robb?

37
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:40,972
He's just a boy.

38
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:43,441
Boys have been
conquerors before.

39
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,776
But the man giving Cersei
sleepless nights

40
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,379
is the King's--
the late King's brother.

41
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,882
Lord Stannis has the best
claim to the Throne,

42
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:56,118
he is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

43
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,286
Stannis Baratheon
is Robert's true heir.

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,588
The Throne
is his by rights.

45
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:05,158
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded
so sweetly for your life,

46
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,427
it would be a shame
to throw it away.

47
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:10,196
Cersei is no fool.

48
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:14,233
She knows a tame wolf is more
use to her than a dead one.

49
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,035
You want me to serve the
woman who murdered my King,

50
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:19,804
who butchered my men,
who crippled my son?

51
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,907
I want you
to serve the realm!

52
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:24,677
Tell the Queen you will confess
your vile treason,

53
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,980
tell your son
to lay down his sword

54
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:30,284
and proclaim Joffrey
as the true heir.

55
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,189
Cersei knows you
as a man of honor.

56
00:04:35,223 --> 00:04:37,291
If you give her
the peace she needs

57
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:40,194
and promise to carry
her secret to your grave,

58
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:44,030
I believe she will allow you to take
the Black and live out your days

59
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,498
on the Wall with your brother
and your bastard son.

60
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:50,601
You think my life is
some precious thing to me?

61
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:55,439
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

62
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,241
Of what?

63
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,114
You grew up with actors.

64
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:09,418
You learned their craft
and you learned it well.

65
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:12,053
But I grew up
with soldiers.

66
00:05:13,989 --> 00:05:17,224
I learned how to die
a long time ago.

67
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:22,028
Pity.

68
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:24,330
<i>Such a pity.</i>

69
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:33,438
What of your
daughter's life, My Lord?

70
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,574
<i>Is that a precious
thing to you?</i>

71
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,340
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

72
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,476
Or so Walder Frey
would have you think.

73
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,811
Keep shooting them down.
We can't risk Lord Walder

74
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,446
sending word of your movements
to the Lannisters.

75
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,482
He's grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

76
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:34,451
Greatjon: Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

77
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,587
Look.

78
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:39,656
<i>Robb: Father rots
in a dungeon.</i>

79
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,724
How long before
they take his head?

80
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:45,060
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

81
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:47,495
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

82
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,498
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

83
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,901
Greatjon: Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.

84
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:56,669
Catelyn: The Freys have held
the crossing for 600 years,

85
00:06:56,703 --> 00:07:00,105
and for 600 years they have never
failed to exact their toll.

86
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,973
Have my horse
saddled and ready.

87
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,710
Enter the Twins alone
and he'll sell you to the Lannis.

88
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:08,578
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

89
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,017
My father would do whatever
it took to secure our crossing.

90
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:16,253
Whatever it took.

91
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,188
If I'm going
to lead this army,

92
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,725
I can't have other men
doing my bargaining for me.

93
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,295
I agree.

94
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,864
<i>- I'll go.
- Theon: You can't!</i>

95
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,499
I have known Lord Walder
since I was a girl.

96
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,167
He would never
harm me.

97
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:32,836
<i>Greatjon: Unless there was
a profit in it.</i>

98
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:40,342
What do you want?

99
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,044
It is a great pleasure to see you
again after so many years, My Lord.

100
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,879
Oh spare me.

101
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:48,882
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

102
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,184
What am I supposed
to do with you?

103
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,554
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here--

104
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:59,023
Who asked you?
You're not Lord Frey yet,

105
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:01,525
not until I die.
Do I look dead to you?

106
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,470
Father, please--

107
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:05,108
I need lessons in courtesy
from you, bastard?

108
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,997
Your mother would still
be a milkmaid

109
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:10,933
if I hadn't squirted you
into her belly.

110
00:08:14,504 --> 00:08:17,672
All right,
you come forward.

111
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,517
There. Now that I've observed
the courtesies,

112
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:35,220
<i>perhaps my sons will do me the honor
of shutting their mouths.</i>

113
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,526
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

114
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,462
We're talking
right now.

115
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:50,266
Fine.

116
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,934
Out! All of you!

117
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,779
You too.

118
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:14,154
You see that?

119
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,789
15 she is.

120
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:18,258
A little flower.

121
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:22,795
And her honey's all mine.

122
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,333
I'm sure she will
give you many sons.

123
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:31,103
Huh. Your father didn't
come to the wedding.

124
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,472
He is quite ill, My Lord.

125
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,408
Didn't come to
the last one either.

126
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,911
Or the one before that.

127
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,514
Your family has always
pissed on me.

128
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,349
- My Lord, I--
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

129
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,752
The fine Lord Tully

130
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:50,053
would never marry any
of his children to mine.

131
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:52,021
I'm sure there
were reasons why--

132
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,690
I didn't need reasons.
I needed to get rid

133
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:58,260
of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

134
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:04,431
Why are you here?

135
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:07,099
To ask you

136
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,434
to open your gates,
My Lord,

137
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:13,949
so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.

138
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,183
Why should I let him?

139
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,157
If you could climb
your own battlements,

140
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:21,011
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

141
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:24,447
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

142
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:26,949
Don't try and frighten me,
Lady Stark.

143
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,518
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

144
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:32,454
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

145
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:34,923
You swore an oath
to my father.

146
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:37,225
Oh yes, I said some words...

147
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:41,094
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

148
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,930
Joffrey's King now,
which makes your boy

149
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:48,500
and his corpses-to-be nothing
but rebels, it seems to me.

150
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,369
If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,

151
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:54,438
I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.

152
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:57,007
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully,

153
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,309
Lannister, Baratheon,

154
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:02,011
give me one good reason

155
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:05,481
why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?

156
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:08,851
<i>And... engage.</i>

157
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:12,384
When does Aemon think you'll
be able to use that hand?

158
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:15,490
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

159
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:19,494
You'll be ready
for this then.

160
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,764
I thought a wolf was
more appropriate for you

161
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,866
than a bear...

162
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:28,870
So I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

163
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:32,739
Works as well for a wolf
as a bear, I think.

164
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:46,250
This is Valyrian steel.

165
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:49,052
It was my father's sword,

166
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,954
his father before him.

167
00:11:50,988 --> 00:11:54,590
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

168
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,692
It was meant
for my son Jorah.

169
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:59,461
He brought dishonor
to our House,

170
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,997
but he had the grace
to leave the sword

171
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:04,800
before he fled
from Westeros.

172
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,169
My Lord, you honor me,
but I can't--

173
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:09,770
Oh, you can
and you will.

174
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:14,140
I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you and your beast.

175
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,444
A bloody dead man
tried to kill me...

176
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,281
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

177
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:26,050
- Is that understood?
- Yes, My Lord.

178
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,152
Right.
Now don't think this means

179
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,488
I approve
of this nonsense

180
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:33,590
with you
and Alliser Thorne.

181
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:36,158
That's a man's sword,

182
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:38,861
it'll take
a man to wield it.

183
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:40,897
I'll apologize
to Ser Alliser tonight.

184
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,365
No you won't!

185
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,467
I sent him to King's Landing
yesterday.

186
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,703
The hand that your wolf

187
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:48,304
tore off
that thing's wrist--

188
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,041
I've ordered Thorne to lay it
at the feet of this...

189
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,909
Boy King.

190
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,778
That should get young
Joffrey's attention.

191
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:00,313
And it puts
a thousand leagues

192
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,115
between you and Thorne.

193
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,651
Now go and put your sword
somewhere safe

194
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,286
and bring me
my supper.

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,787
Yes, My Lord.

196
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,899
- Well done.
- Well done.

197
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,670
You earned that, Snow.

198
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,673
Well done.

199
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:39,409
Go on,
let's have a look.

200
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,845
- At what?
- Grenn: The sword! Show us the sword.

201
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:45,082
Sword! Sword!
Sword! Sword!

202
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,159
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

203
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:58,195
Get off of it.
Piss off.

204
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,664
Come on, I want to have
a look at it in the light.

205
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,237
Pyp:
Give it here!

206
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,139
What is it?

207
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,241
- I--
- Look at its eyes.

208
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:11,809
- Give it.
- I can't.

209
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:14,612
You can't what?

210
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:19,182
I-- I'm really not
supposed to say.

211
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:22,685
And yet you really
want to say.

212
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,454
You want to say
that...?

213
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,726
There was a raven.

214
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,128
I read the message
to Maester Aemon.

215
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,931
It's your brother Robb.

216
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:39,099
What?

217
00:14:39,134 --> 00:14:40,934
What about him?

218
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:43,903
He's heading south.

219
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:45,805
To war.

220
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:51,143
All his bannermen have rallied
to his side. They'll keep him safe.

221
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,313
I should be there.

222
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:59,650
I should be with him.

223
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,996
...If we do that, they'll never
get back across.

224
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,566
Robb: Well?

225
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,101
What did he say?

226
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:25,003
Lord Walder has granted
your crossing.

227
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:29,974
- His men are yours as well--
- Greatjon: Huh.

228
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:32,209
--Less the 400 he will keep here
to hold the crossing

229
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:33,945
against any who would
pursue you.

230
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:35,380
And what does
he want in return?

231
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:39,016
You will be taking on his son
Olyvar as your personal squire.

232
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,753
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine fine.

233
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,189
And?

234
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:49,225
And Arya

235
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,427
will marry his son Waldron

236
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:54,530
<i>- when they both come of age.
- She won't be happy about that.</i>

237
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,298
Hmmm.

238
00:15:59,102 --> 00:16:00,669
And?

239
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,406
And

240
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:07,476
when the fighting
is done...

241
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:11,380
You will marry
one of his daughters.

242
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,350
<i>Whichever you prefer.</i>

243
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:17,887
He has a number he thinks
will be... suitable.

244
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:19,989
I see.

245
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:24,126
Did you get a look at his daughters?

246
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,927
<i>I did.</i>

247
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:28,195
And?

248
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,398
One was...

249
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,671
Do you consent?

250
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,640
Can I refuse?

251
00:16:40,674 --> 00:16:42,841
Not if you want to cross.

252
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,313
Then I consent.

253
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,454
Sam said you wanted
to see me?

254
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,356
I did indeed.

255
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,055
Perhaps you would be
kind enough to assist me.

256
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:46,793
Tell me,
did you ever wonder

257
00:17:46,827 --> 00:17:49,695
why the men
of The Night's Watch

258
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:52,597
take no wives
and father no children?

259
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:54,732
No.

260
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,201
So they will not love.

261
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:00,770
<i>Love is the death
of duty.</i>

262
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:04,774
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose

263
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:07,409
between honor
on the one hand

264
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:10,078
and those he loves
on the other,

265
00:18:10,113 --> 00:18:12,147
what would he do?

266
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:16,550
He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

267
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:21,355
Then Lord Stark
is one man in 10,000.

268
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:24,524
Most of us are not
so strong.

269
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:26,392
What is honor

270
00:18:26,426 --> 00:18:29,028
compared
to a woman's love?

271
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:31,630
<i>And what is duty</i>

272
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:35,200
<i>against the feel of a newborn son
in your arms?</i>

273
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,903
Or a brother's smile?

274
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,640
Sam told you.

275
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:45,575
We're all human.

276
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,177
Oh, we all do our duty when
there's no cost to it.

277
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,013
Honor comes easy then.

278
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,983
Yet sooner or later

279
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:57,885
in every man's life

280
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,788
there comes a day
when it is not easy,

281
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:04,090
a day when
he must choose.

282
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,893
And this is my day?

283
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,028
Is that what
you're saying?

284
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:13,198
Oh, it hurts, boy.
Oh yes.

285
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:16,300
- I know.
- You do not know!

286
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:20,104
No one knows.

287
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,007
I may be a bastard,

288
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,510
but he is my father
and Robb is my brother.

289
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:34,652
The Gods were cruel when they
saw fit to test my vows.

290
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,156
They waited till I was old.

291
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:42,295
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South--

292
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:45,230
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

293
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,899
I was helpless,

294
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,734
blind, frail.

295
00:19:52,336 --> 00:19:55,438
But when I heard

296
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:58,073
they had killed
my brother's son,

297
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:00,175
and his poor son...

298
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,642
And the children!

299
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:04,879
Even the little children.

300
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:07,981
Who are you?

301
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:13,853
My father was Maekar,

302
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,221
the first of his name.

303
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,458
My brother Aegon
reigned after him

304
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:23,460
when I had refused
the Throne.

305
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:27,064
And he was followed
by his son Aerys,

306
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,766
whom they called
the Mad King.

307
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,102
You're Aemon Targaryen.

308
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:36,071
I'm a Maester
of the Citadel,

309
00:20:36,106 --> 00:20:41,643
bound in service to Castle Black
and The Night's Watch.

310
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,915
I will not tell you
to stay or go.

311
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:51,418
You must make
that choice yourself,

312
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:55,454
and live with it
for the rest of your days.

313
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,891
As I have.

314
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:27,513
Drogo.

<i>Kevan:
Our scouts tell us</i>

318
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:58,430
<i>the Stark host has moved
south from the Twins</i>

319
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,165
with Lord Frey's levies
in tow.

320
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:03,300
They're a day's
march north.

321
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:06,003
The boy may lack
experience and sense,

322
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:09,106
<i>but he does have
a certain mindless</i>

323
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,442
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

324
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:18,179
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

325
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,715
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

326
00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:22,717
otherwise we've wasted
good steel on them.

327
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:26,153
The great hairy one insisted he
must have two battle axes--

328
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,722
heavy black steel,
double-sided.

329
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:30,690
Shagga likes axes.

330
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,325
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings

331
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,560
<i>will be in the vanguard.</i>

332
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,028
<i>- The vanguard?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

333
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,929
Me and the tribesmen
on the front lines?

334
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:42,467
<i>They do seem
rather ferocious.</i>

335
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,840
Ferocious?
Last night

336
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:51,510
a Moon brother stabbed
a Stone Crow over a sausage.

337
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:55,415
<i>Three Stone Crows seized the Moon
brother and opened his throat.</i>

338
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,418
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
chopping off the dead man's cock,

339
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,654
which was fortunate,
but even still

340
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:02,489
Ulf is demanding
blood money,

341
00:24:02,523 --> 00:24:05,125
which Shagga and Gunthor
refuse to pay.

342
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,261
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

343
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:09,829
Surely there are ways
to have me killed

344
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,899
that would be less detrimental
to the war effort.

345
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,635
There'll be no more
discussion on the matter.

346
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:22,075
It appears I'm not
hungry after all.

347
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:23,977
Excuse me, My Lords.

348
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:39,657
Where did you find one
so pretty at this hour?

349
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,426
- I took her.
- Took her?

350
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,495
- From whom?
- From, uh...

351
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:47,396
Ser-- what's his name?

352
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:50,132
I don't know.
Ginger cunt three tents down.

353
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,369
<i>And he didn't have anything
to say about it?</i>

354
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:56,905
He said something.

355
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,975
Well, the odds of me
living long enough

356
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,611
for him to retaliate
just dropped drastically.

357
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,046
We'll be at
the vanguard tomorrow.

358
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,916
Oh well.

359
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:17,221
I... think I'll go
and find myself one.

360
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,191
Who are you?

361
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:24,526
Who would you like me to be?

362
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,962
What did your mother
call you?

363
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:28,748
Shae.

364
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:30,509
What did your
mother call you?

365
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,102
My mother died
giving birth to me.

366
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:36,672
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

367
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:40,208
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

368
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:42,076
For--

369
00:25:43,478 --> 00:25:45,212
What do you want
from me?

370
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,981
What do I want from you?

371
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:51,351
I want you to share my tent.

372
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:54,420
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

373
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:57,257
rub my legs when they're
sore after a day's ride.

374
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,559
I want you to take
no other man to bed

375
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,560
for as long
as we're together.

376
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:05,764
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world--

377
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:08,067
which it may well be.

378
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,703
And what do I get?

379
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,973
One: Safety.

380
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,743
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

381
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:19,145
Two: The pleasure
of my company,

382
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,147
which I have heard
is spectacular.

383
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,516
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

384
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,652
And three: More gold

385
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,154
<i>than you can spend if you
lived a thousand years.</i>

386
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:34,290
Do you accept my proposal?

387
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,840
Let's start with your last night
in this world.

388
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Doth-- Dothrae...

389
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,026
Ki ha-- hammi...

390
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:24,762
Ish nokitta...

391
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,764
Qana'th...

392
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,134
<i>Jorah:
Khaleesi.</i>

393
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,568
Come.

394
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:35,972
He's very strong.

395
00:27:36,006 --> 00:27:39,141
No one understands
how strong he is.

396
00:27:57,424 --> 00:28:01,026
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

397
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,762
He can't.
I won't let him.

398
00:28:03,796 --> 00:28:07,031
Even a Queen doesn't
have that power.

399
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:12,936
We must go quickly. I've heard
there's a good port in Asshai--

400
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,173
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

401
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,241
Doth--

402
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:21,176
Even if--

403
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:24,279
--Even if he dies,

404
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:27,116
<i>why would I run?</i>

405
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:29,351
<i>I am Khaleesi</i>

406
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:32,988
and my-- my son will be
Khal after Drogo.

407
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:36,091
This isn't Westeros
where men honor blood.

408
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:39,127
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting

409
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:40,962
<i>after Drogo dies.</i>

410
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:43,632
Whoever wins that fight
will be the new Khal.

411
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,867
He won't want any rivals.

412
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:48,503
Your boy will be plucked
from your breast

413
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,705
<i>and given to the dogs.</i>

414
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,442
I won't leave him.

415
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:06,921
The wound
has festered.

416
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:09,812
I think you should wear
your armor tonight, Ser.

417
00:30:09,846 --> 00:30:12,447
I think you're right.

418
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:18,653
You've saved me
once more.

419
00:30:18,687 --> 00:30:21,322
<i>And now you must
save him.</i>

420
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,725
He's beyond
the healer's skills.

421
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,460
All I can do is
ease his path.

422
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,628
Save him and I will free you.
I swear it.

423
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,932
You must know a way...

424
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:33,800
Some...

425
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,701
Some magic.

426
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,205
There is a spell.

427
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,473
Some would say death
is cleaner.

428
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,019
Do it.

429
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,120
Save him.

430
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,954
There is a price.

431
00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:00,493
You'll have gold--
whatever you want.

432
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,991
It's not a matter of gold.
This is Bloodmagic.

433
00:31:03,026 --> 00:31:05,293
Only death pays for life.

434
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:10,196
My death?

435
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:13,232
No.
Not your death, Khaleesi.

436
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,402
Bring me his horse.

437
00:31:39,828 --> 00:31:41,462
Khaleesi,
do not do this thing.

438
00:31:41,496 --> 00:31:45,265
<i>- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your Khal.</i>

439
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:48,101
This is Bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

440
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:51,904
I am your Khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

441
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:03,616
Go now!

442
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,852
- Take her and leave.
- Huh-uh.

443
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:08,054
Take her!

444
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:11,491
Irriya?

445
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,327
You must go also, lady.

446
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:16,662
<i>Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.</i>

447
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:19,465
The dead will
dance here tonight.

448
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:34,547
No one will enter.

449
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:45,091
<i>Bring him back to me.</i>

450
00:33:01,575 --> 00:33:03,476
What have you done?

451
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,811
I have to save him.

452
00:33:05,846 --> 00:33:08,981
We could have been 10 miles away from
here by now on the way to Asshai.

453
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:11,217
You would have been safe.

454
00:33:17,357 --> 00:33:19,625
<i>Qotho:
Jíni'th vos eo.</i>

455
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,431
Mra qothoon vosaan--

456
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,835
Khaleesi!

457
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,444
Are you hurt?

458
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:16,945
- The baby...
- Hmm?

459
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,614
...Is coming.

460
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:21,183
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come.

461
00:34:21,218 --> 00:34:23,219
They say
she is cursed.

462
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,789
They'll come or I'll
have their heads.

463
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:29,559
The witch--
she can bring baby.

464
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:32,130
I hear her say so.

465
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:55,578
Shae: Are you in agony,
my lion?

466
00:34:55,612 --> 00:34:58,180
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

467
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:01,583
The fire is burning
your pretty soft skin.

468
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,854
Ahhh.

469
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,291
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

470
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:13,526
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

471
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,297
Let's play a new game.

472
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:21,432
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you--

473
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:24,268
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

474
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:27,270
- Not if you win.
- No!

475
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:29,805
No more fire games,
no knife games.

476
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,741
Let's do something
I'm good at.

477
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,976
What are you good at?

478
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,977
I happen to be a great
judge of character.

479
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:39,412
<i>- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.</i>

480
00:35:39,446 --> 00:35:42,215
<i>Here's how it works:
I make a statement</i>

481
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:44,684
about your past.
If I'm right,

482
00:35:44,718 --> 00:35:46,952
you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

483
00:35:46,987 --> 00:35:49,687
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

484
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:51,789
I don't want to play
this game.

485
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:54,024
Fine.
Bronn first.

486
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:00,363
Your father beat you.

487
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:07,968
But my mother
hit harder.

488
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:13,907
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

489
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,842
It was a woman.

490
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,479
She swung
an axe at me.

491
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,815
You've been
North of the Wall.

492
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:28,953
What brought you
up there?

493
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,256
Work.

494
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:33,325
And...

495
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:35,394
You once loved a woman
many years ago,

496
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:38,697
but it turned out badly so you've
never let yourself love again.

497
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,934
Oh wait, that's me.

498
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:49,006
Your turn, my mysterious
foreign beauty.

499
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,875
I don't want to play.

500
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,779
It's fun!
Look at the fun we're having.

501
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,450
Your mother
was a whore.

502
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,287
Drink.

503
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,727
All right.

504
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,497
Your father left the family when
you were very young,

505
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,532
- never to return.
- Drink.

506
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,491
And we've established
the rules about lying?

507
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:19,716
Drink!

508
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,642
Mmmm.

509
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,878
You wanted
a different life.

510
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,047
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

511
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:34,650
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

512
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,952
So specifics--

513
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:40,189
you wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

514
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:43,893
I don't believe the life
of the silent sisters is for you.

515
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:48,197
So what's
a lowborn girl to do?

516
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,802
Drink.

517
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:58,507
- Are you sure--
- drink!

518
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:06,716
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever

519
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,188
or I will carve your eyes
from your head.

520
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,760
My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.

521
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,961
My turn.

522
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,397
Fine fine.

523
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,732
Ask away.

524
00:38:23,766 --> 00:38:26,835
Try to penetrate
the enigma that is me.

525
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,637
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

526
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:32,005
I don't care the way
the game works.

527
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,141
Our Lord here
used to be married.

528
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:37,244
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

529
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:40,815
You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.

530
00:38:43,252 --> 00:38:44,553
Another night,
perhaps.

531
00:38:44,587 --> 00:38:47,890
Not another night.
This night.

532
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,061
It's not
a pleasant story.

533
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:56,236
- Or maybe I will cry.
- I'm guessing the lady and I

534
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,006
can tell more unpleasant stories
than your Lordship.

535
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,673
So...

536
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,480
I was 16. My brother Jaime
and I were riding

537
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:14,216
when we heard a scream.
She ran out onto the road,

538
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,917
clothes half torn off
with two men on her heels.

539
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:21,487
Jaime scared away the men easily
enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.

540
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:23,576
She was too scared to send off
on her own,

541
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:25,448
so while Jaime
hunted down the rapers

542
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:28,627
I took her to the nearest
inn and fed her.

543
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:31,429
Her name was Tysha.

544
00:39:31,463 --> 00:39:33,698
She was
a wheelwright's orphan.

545
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:35,866
And she was hungry--

546
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:39,303
together we finished off
three chickens and a flagon of wine.

547
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:42,738
Impossible as it seems, there was a
time when I was unaccustomed to wine.

548
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:45,607
I forgot how afraid
I was around girls,

549
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:49,045
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me

550
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,513
or look away embarrassed

551
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:53,948
or ask me about my tall
handsome brother.

552
00:39:53,983 --> 00:39:57,085
I forgot about
everything but Tysha.

553
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:00,721
And somehow I found
myself in her bed.

554
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:03,190
For three chickens,
I should hope so.

555
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:07,094
It didn't last long. I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

556
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:09,730
But she was good to me.

557
00:40:09,765 --> 00:40:11,866
She kissed me afterwards

558
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,802
and sang me a song.

559
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:19,941
And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.

560
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:22,677
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken Septon

561
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,113
and there you have it--
man and wife.

562
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:28,750
For a fortnight anyway,
until the Septon sobered up

563
00:40:28,784 --> 00:40:30,818
and told my father.

564
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:33,821
I imagine that was
the end of all that.

565
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:35,889
Not quite.

566
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:39,527
First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.

567
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,664
The girl was a whore,
you see.

568
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,168
Jaime had arranged
the whole thing,

569
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:50,037
the road, the rapers--
all of it.

570
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,673
He thought it was time
I had a woman.

571
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:56,811
<i>After my brother confessed,</i>

572
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:00,147
my father brought in my wife

573
00:41:00,182 --> 00:41:02,950
and gave her
to his guards.

574
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:06,520
<i>He paid her well--
a silver for each man.</i>

575
00:41:06,554 --> 00:41:09,523
How many whores command
that kind of price?

576
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:14,495
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

577
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:17,931
By the end,
she had so much silver

578
00:41:17,965 --> 00:41:20,900
that the coins were
slipping through her fingers

579
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:23,736
and rolling
onto the floor.

580
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:29,476
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

581
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,746
You should have known
she was a whore.

582
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,081
Really?

583
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:37,951
I was 16, drunk
and in love--

584
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:39,886
A girl who
was almost raped

585
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:42,889
doesn't invite another man
into her bed two hours later.

586
00:41:44,491 --> 00:41:48,794
As I said, I was
young and stupid.

587
00:41:50,997 --> 00:41:53,432
You are still
young and stupid.

588
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:18,956
Hyah!

589
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:36,807
What is it?
What do you want?

590
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:38,676
You're sleeping
through the war.

591
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:41,612
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

592
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:43,880
They're a mile north.

593
00:42:43,915 --> 00:42:46,516
<i>- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.</i>

594
00:42:48,886 --> 00:42:51,220
If I die, weep for me.

595
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:55,557
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

596
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:03,568
I'll know.

597
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:07,271
Watch out!
Move!

598
00:43:08,307 --> 00:43:09,874
Out of the way!

599
00:43:09,908 --> 00:43:12,277
- Move aside!

600
00:43:18,419 --> 00:43:20,286
stay low.

601
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:22,422
Stay low?

602
00:43:22,456 --> 00:43:25,024
If you're lucky,
no one will notice you.

603
00:43:25,058 --> 00:43:27,594
I was born lucky.

604
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:32,499
Tribesmen of the Vale,

605
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:35,369
gather round!

606
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,905
Stone Crows!

607
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,207
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

608
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:42,977
<i>- Moon brothers!
- Man: And painted dogs!</i>

609
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:45,379
And painted dogs!

610
00:43:45,413 --> 00:43:48,882
Your dominion over
the Vale begins now!

611
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,785
Onward to claim
what is yours!

612
00:43:51,819 --> 00:43:54,254
Half man! Half man!

613
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:57,223
Half man!
Half man!

614
00:43:57,257 --> 00:44:00,459
Half man! Half man!

615
00:44:00,493 --> 00:44:02,427
To battle.

616
00:44:44,665 --> 00:44:47,000
<i>Bronn:
You're a shit warrior.</i>

617
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:51,003
I'm alive?

618
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:54,372
You're alive.

619
00:44:58,978 --> 00:45:00,778
Did we win?

620
00:45:00,813 --> 00:45:03,414
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

621
00:45:16,293 --> 00:45:19,095
How did our
tribesmen do?

622
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:22,432
Yeah, good.

623
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:25,602
<i>It's nice to see them
getting along.</i>

624
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:27,704
<i>Tywin:
You're wounded.</i>

625
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:30,939
Good of you to notice.

626
00:45:30,973 --> 00:45:33,074
I hear we won.

627
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:35,743
Hmph.
The scouts were wrong.

628
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:39,813
There were 2,000
Stark bannermen, not 20,000.

629
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:42,983
Did we get the Stark boy,
at least?

630
00:45:43,017 --> 00:45:45,051
He wasn't here.

631
00:45:45,086 --> 00:45:46,920
Where was he?

632
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:49,622
With his other 18,000 men.

633
00:45:52,525 --> 00:45:54,993
And where are they?

634
00:46:05,102 --> 00:46:07,438
- We should go, My Lady.
- No!

635
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:14,910
My Lady!

636
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:18,646
Hyah hyah!

637
00:46:49,939 --> 00:46:53,675
By the time they knew what was
happening, it had already happened.

638
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:59,113
Lady Stark.
I'd offer you my sword,

639
00:46:59,148 --> 00:47:01,148
but I seem
to have lost it.

640
00:47:01,182 --> 00:47:03,716
It's not your sword I want.

641
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:06,385
Give me my daughters back.

642
00:47:06,452 --> 00:47:08,520
Give me my husband.

643
00:47:08,554 --> 00:47:10,755
I've lost them too,
I'm afraid.

644
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:13,357
<i>Theon: Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.</i>

645
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:15,559
He cut down 10 of our men--
you saw him.

646
00:47:15,593 --> 00:47:18,495
He's more use
to us alive than dead.

647
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:21,597
Catelyn: Take him away
and put him in irons.

648
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:24,400
We could end this war
right now, boy,

649
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:26,468
save thousands of lives.

650
00:47:26,503 --> 00:47:29,371
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

651
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:32,673
Swords or lances, teeth, nails--
choose your weapons

652
00:47:32,707 --> 00:47:35,275
and let's end this
here and now.

653
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:40,145
If we do it your way,
Kingslayer,

654
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,880
you'd win.

655
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:47,251
We're not doing it
your way.

656
00:47:49,187 --> 00:47:51,287
Greatjon:
Come on, pretty man.

657
00:47:59,663 --> 00:48:02,465
I sent 2,000 men
to their graves today.

658
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:05,034
The bards will sing songs
of their sacrifice.

659
00:48:05,068 --> 00:48:08,304
Aye. But the dead
won't hear them.

660
00:48:15,144 --> 00:48:17,846
One victory does not
make us conquerors.

661
00:48:19,782 --> 00:48:22,417
Did we free my father?

662
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:25,353
Did we rescue my sisters
from the Queen?

663
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:30,526
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

664
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:38,298
This war is far from over.

665
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:10,395
Could I have one?

666
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,031
A lemon one--
or any of them.

667
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:14,599
Three coppers.

668
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:17,201
How about
a nice fat pigeon?

669
00:49:17,236 --> 00:49:19,136
Piss off now.
Go on.

670
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:22,039
Do you have any stale ones
from yesterday?

671
00:49:22,074 --> 00:49:24,208
- Or any burnt ones?
- Piss off!

672
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:34,019
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

673
00:49:34,053 --> 00:49:35,503
They're taking him
to the Sept of Baelor.

674
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:36,397
Who?

675
00:49:36,398 --> 00:49:38,332
The Hand of the King.

676
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:48,125
- Traitor!
- Coward!

677
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,027
Baelor.

678
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:51,694
Baelor!

679
00:50:57,367 --> 00:51:00,002
Traitor!
Traitor!

680
00:51:19,953 --> 00:51:22,054
I am Eddard Stark,

681
00:51:22,088 --> 00:51:24,488
Lord of Winterfell

682
00:51:24,523 --> 00:51:26,690
and Hand of the King.

683
00:51:35,532 --> 00:51:38,033
I come before you
to confess my treason

684
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:41,469
<i>in the sight of Gods
and men.</i>

685
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,906
<i>I betrayed the faith
of my King</i>

686
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:48,309
and the trust
of my friend Robert.

687
00:51:49,578 --> 00:51:52,713
I swore to protect
and defend his children,

688
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:55,115
but before his blood
was cold

689
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:57,650
<i>I plotted
to murder his son...</i>

690
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:01,420
And seize the Throne
for myself.

691
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:04,089
Traitor!

692
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,397
Let the high Septon

693
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,034
and Baelor the blessed
bear witness to what I say:

694
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,073
Joffrey Baratheon

695
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:25,942
is the one true heir
to the Iron Throne,

696
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,612
<i>by the Grace
of all the gods,</i>

697
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,181
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

698
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,483
and Protector
of the Realm.

699
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:44,127
As we sin,

700
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:46,096
so do we suffer.

701
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,999
This man has
confessed his crimes

702
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:51,702
in sight
of Gods and men.

703
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:55,238
The Gods are just

704
00:52:55,273 --> 00:52:58,108
but beloved Baelor
taught us

705
00:52:58,142 --> 00:53:01,944
they can also be
merciful.

706
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,349
What is to be done

707
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,851
with this traitor,
Your Grace?

708
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:16,860
My mother wishes me to let
Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch.

709
00:53:16,895 --> 00:53:19,563
Stripped of all titles
and powers,

710
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:22,233
he would serve the realm
in permanent exile.

711
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:23,968
And My Lady Sansa

712
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:27,471
<i>has begged mercy
for her father.</i>

713
00:53:31,009 --> 00:53:34,144
But they have
the soft hearts of women.

714
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:36,713
So long as I am your King,

715
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:40,651
<i>treason shall never
go unpunished.</i>

716
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:42,752
Ser Ilyn,

717
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,387
bring me his head!

718
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,589
Women: No! Stop!

719
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,725
Daddy!
Someone stop him!

720
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,905
My son, this is madness.

721
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,675
<i>Ilyn:
Put him down!</i>

722
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,083
- Don't look!
- Let me go.

723
00:54:13,118 --> 00:54:16,086
- Let me go!
- Shut your mouth. Look at me.

724
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,889
- Look at me!
- Stop! Daddy!

725
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,991
- Stop! No no!
- Crowd: Traitor!

726
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,559
<i>Stop!</i>

727
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,963
Stop him, stop!

728
00:55:10,542 --> 00:55:13,678
