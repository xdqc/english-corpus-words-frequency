1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:03,109
<i>Still not far</i>
<i>from Pentos, Your Grace.</i>

2
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:04,544
You'd be more
comfortable there.

3
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:06,945
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,780
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

5
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:11,414
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

6
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:13,184
I have something for you.

7
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:16,119
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

8
00:00:16,154 --> 00:00:20,390
17 years ago you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

9
00:00:20,424 --> 00:00:24,126
- <i>And now you're leaving again.</i>
- Ned: <i>I have no choice.</i>

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,527
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

11
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:29,096
The Starks have manned The Wall for
thousands of years.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,764
<i>And you are a Stark.</i>

13
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:34,069
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

14
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:36,638
What of it?
Tell me we're not speaking of this.

15
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:40,075
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,779
Rapers. Not impressed
by your new brothers?

17
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:45,681
<i>Lovely thing</i>
<i>about The Watch--</i>

18
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:49,250
<i>you discard your old family</i>
<i>and get a whole new one.</i>

19
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:51,085
Welcome.

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,655
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

21
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:55,990
I think he was thrown.
No!

22
00:00:56,024 --> 00:00:58,859
<i>Someone tried</i>
<i>to kill him twice.</i>

23
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,327
<i>I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

24
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:05,431
- Lord Stark must be told of this.
- Catelyn: <i>I will go myself.</i>

25
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,365
What is the meaning
of this?

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,368
<i>Joff told us what happened.</i>

27
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,838
<i>You and that boy beat him with</i>
<i>clubs while you set your wolf on him.</i>

28
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,673
<i>That's not what happened!</i>

29
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,841
Ahh!

30
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,311
We found no trace
of the direwolf, Your Grace.

31
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,382
- We have another wolf.
- As you will.

32
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,250
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

33
00:01:23,285 --> 00:01:25,887
<i>Lady didn't bite anyone!</i>
<i>She's good!</i>

34
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,723

36
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:45,253
Welcome, Lord Stark.

37
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:48,122
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

38
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:50,257
The honor of your presence
is requested.

39
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,862
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

40
00:03:54,896 --> 00:03:57,531
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my Lord.

41
00:03:57,566 --> 00:04:01,302
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...

42
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:39,808
Thank the gods
you're here, Stark.

43
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:43,986
About time we had some
stern, northern leadership.

44
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,915
About glad to see you're
protecting the throne.

45
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:48,983
Sturdy old thing.

46
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:51,486
How many Kings' asses
have polished it, I wonder?

47
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,521
Um, what's the line?

48
00:04:53,556 --> 00:04:56,659
The King shits
and The Hand wipes.

49
00:04:56,693 --> 00:05:00,163
Very handsome armor.

50
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:02,599
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

51
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:06,170
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

52
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:09,073
You've chosen your opponents
wisely then.

53
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,344
I have a knack for it.

54
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,616
It must be strange for you
coming into this room.

55
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,855
I was standing right here
when it happened.

56
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,924
He was very brave,
your brother.

57
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,760
Your father too.

58
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:30,928
They didn't deserve
to die like that.

59
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,831
Nobody deserves
to die like that.

60
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,733
But you just stood there
and watched.

61
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,737
500 men just stood there
and watched.

62
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,540
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms--

63
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,975
you think anyone said a word,
lifted a finger?

64
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,611
No, Lord Stark.

65
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:51,249
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

66
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:55,387
Except for the screams,
of course,

67
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,256
and the Mad King
laughing.

68
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,026
And later...

69
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,694
when I watched
the Mad King die,

70
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:07,097
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

71
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,067
It felt like justice.

72
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,739
Is that what you
tell yourself at night?

73
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,544
You're a servant
of justice?

74
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:21,646
That you were avenging
my father when you

75
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,250
shoved your sword in
Aerys Targaryen's back?

76
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,052
Tell me--

77
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:29,122
if I'd stabbed the Mad King
in the belly instead of the back,

78
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,726
would you admire me more?

79
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,295
You served him well

80
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:37,265
when serving was safe.

81
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:51,347
Lord Stark.

82
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:55,584
Lord Varys.

83
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:58,987
I was grievously sorry to hear of
your troubles on the Kingsroad.

84
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:02,657
We are all praying for
Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

85
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:06,127
A shame you didn't say
a prayer for the butcher's son.

86
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:10,564
Renly!
You're looking well.

87
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,366
And you look
tired from the road.

88
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,568
I told them this meeting could
wait another day, but--

89
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:17,371
<i>But we have a Kingdom</i>
<i>to look after.</i>

90
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:20,674
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

91
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,462
No doubt Lady Catelyn
has mentioned me.

92
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,113
She has, Lord Baelish.

93
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:27,414
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

94
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,684
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem

95
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,687
from navel to collarbone.

96
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,789
Perhaps you chose
the wrong man to duel with.

97
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,791
It wasn't the <i>man</i>
that I chose, my Lord.

98
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:39,194
It was Catelyn Tully.

99
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,565
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

100
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,268
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.

101
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:47,938
Grand Maester.

102
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:50,174
How many years has it been?

103
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,878
- <i>You were a young man.</i>
- And you served another King.

104
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:58,449
Oh, how forgetful of me.

105
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,319
This belongs to you, now.

106
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:06,691
<i>Should we begin?</i>

107
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:09,761
- Without the King?
- Winter may be coming,

108
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,098
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

109
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:15,199
His Grace has many cares.

110
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:18,235
He entrusts some
small matters to us

111
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:20,070
that we might
lighten the load.

112
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:23,006
We are the Lords
of Small Matters here.

113
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:30,446
<i>My brother instructs us</i>
<i>to stage a tournament</i>

114
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:33,316
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

115
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,620
Mmm, how much?

116
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:36,821
40,000 gold dragons
to the champion,

117
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:38,755
<i>20,000 to the runner-up,</i>

118
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,925
20,000 to
the winning archer.

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,262
Can the treasury bear
such expense?

120
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:45,485
I'll have to borrow it.

121
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,710
The Lannisters will
accommodate, I expect.

122
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:49,325
We already owe Lord Tywin
three million gold.

123
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,435
What's another 80,000?

124
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:52,341
Are you telling me the crown
is three million in debt?

125
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:54,472
I'm telling you the crown
is <i>six</i> million in debt.

126
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,407
How could you
let this happen?

127
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:58,208
The Master of Coin
finds the money.

128
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,677
The King
and The Hand spend it.

129
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:02,446
I will not believe
Jon Arryn

130
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,281
allowed Robert
to bankrupt the realm.

131
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:07,284
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,

132
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:09,586
but I fear his Grace

133
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,523
- doesn't always listen.
- "Counting coppers," he calls it.

134
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,925
I'll speak to him
tomorrow.

135
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,828
This tournament is an
extravagance we cannot afford.

136
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:21,230
As you will. But still,
we'd best make our plans.

137
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,398
There will be no plans

138
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,767
until I speak to Robert.

139
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:31,305
Forgive me, my Lords.
I'm--

140
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,009
- <i>I had a long ride.</i>
- You are The King's Hand,

141
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:38,613
Lord Stark, we serve
at your pleasure.

142
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:47,724
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

143
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:53,564
- It's ugly.
- A King should have scars

144
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:57,401
you fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

145
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,737
I'm not like him.
I didn't fight off anything.

146
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,773
It bit me and all
I did was scream.

147
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:04,075
And the two Stark girls
saw it, both of them.

148
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,179
That's not true.
You killed the beast.

149
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:10,415
You only spared the girl because
of the love your father bears her father.

150
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:11,260
I didn't, I--

151
00:10:11,285 --> 00:10:13,290
When Aerys Targaryen
sat on the Iron Throne,

152
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:16,054
your father was a rebel
and a traitor.

153
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:20,458
Someday you'll sit on the throne
and the truth will be what you make it.

154
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,928
Do I have
to marry her?

155
00:10:25,963 --> 00:10:27,763
Yes.

156
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:31,166
She's very beautiful
and young.

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,436
If you don't like her, you only
need to see her on formal occasions

158
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:38,373
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

159
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,546
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores,
you'll fuck painted whores.

160
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,682
And if you'd rather lie
with noble virgins, so be it.

161
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,750
You are my darling boy
and the world will be

162
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:51,019
exactly as you
want it to be.

163
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,492
Do something nice
for the Stark girl.

164
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:58,795
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

165
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,899
The occasional kindness will spare
you all sorts of trouble down the road.

166
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:05,969
We allow the Northerners
too much power.

167
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:08,372
They consider themselves
our equals.

168
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,541
How would you handle them?

169
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,743
I'd double their taxes

170
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:16,279
and command them to supply
10,000 men to the Royal Army.

171
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:17,795
A Royal Army?

172
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,596
Why should every lord
command his own men?

173
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:21,950
It's primitive,
no better than the hill tribes.

174
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:24,920
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the crown,

175
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,788
trained by
experienced soldiers--

176
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:30,425
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

177
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:33,027
And if
the Northerners rebel?

178
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,696
I'd crush them.

179
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,432
Seize Winterfell and install
someone loyal to the realm

180
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:40,401
as warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

181
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:44,105
And these 10,000 Northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

182
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,574
- For me. I'm their King.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

183
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,709
But you've just
invaded their homeland,

184
00:11:48,743 --> 00:11:51,511
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

185
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:54,548
The North cannot be held--
not by an outsider.

186
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:57,217
It's too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes,

187
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,587
the Seven Gods together couldn't
save you and your royal army.

188
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:03,589
A good King knows
when to save his strength...

189
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,426
And when to destroy
his enemies.

190
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,195
So you agree...

191
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,631
The Starks are enemies?

192
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,369
Everyone who isn't us

193
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,405
is an enemy.

194
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,277
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

195
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,213
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

196
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:28,315
- The Prince.
- <i>Arya, stop!</i>

197
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,519
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

198
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,057
The Hound killed your friend.

199
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:35,412
The Hound does whatever
the Prince tells him to do.

200
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:36,405
You're an idiot.

201
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,065
You're a liar, and if
you told the truth

202
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,862
- Mycah would be alive.
- Enough!

203
00:12:42,464 --> 00:12:44,165
What's happening here?

204
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:47,501
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

205
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,505
Go to your room.
We'll speak later.

206
00:12:59,349 --> 00:13:02,317
That's for you, love.

207
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:13,563
<i>The same dollmaker makes all</i>
<i>of Princess Myrcella's toys.</i>

208
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,402
Don't you like it?

209
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:21,339
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.

210
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:25,510
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

211
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:29,215
It's all right.
Go on.

212
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:40,858
War was easier
than daughters.

213
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,563
Go away!

214
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:50,165
<i>Arya, open the door.</i>

215
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:02,410
May I come in?

216
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:11,552
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

217
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:13,421
Give it to me.

218
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:23,032
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

219
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:26,970
Where did you get this?

220
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:33,110
This is no toy.

221
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:36,410
Little ladies shouldn't
play with swords.

222
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:37,635
I wasn't playing.

223
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:39,882
And I don't want
to be a lady.

224
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,317
Come here.

225
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:49,891
Now what do you want
with this?

226
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:51,826
It's called Needle.

227
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,496
Oh, a blade with a name.

228
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:58,433
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

229
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,202
Your sister?

230
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:02,604
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

231
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,406
Stick 'em
with the pointy end.

232
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,442
That's the essence of it.

233
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,314
I was trying
to learn.

234
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,919
I asked Mycah
to practice with me.

235
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,391
I asked him.

236
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:24,295
- It was my fault.
- No, sweet girl.

237
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:27,832
No no, you didn't kill
the butcher's boy.

238
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:32,270
I hate them!
I hate all of them.

239
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,906
The Hound, the Queen
and the King

240
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,388
and Joffrey and Sansa.

241
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:38,823
Sansa was dragged before
the King and Queen...

242
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:42,847
And asked to call
the Prince a liar.

243
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,383
So was I!
He <i>is</i> a liar.

244
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:47,519
Shh, darling,
listen to me.

245
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:52,024
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey's someday.

246
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:54,360
She cannot betray him.

247
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:57,230
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

248
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,168
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

249
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,972
Well.

250
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:09,077
Look me.

251
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:12,380
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

252
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,950
Winter is coming.

253
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,653
You were born
in the long summer.

254
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,788
You've never known
anything else.

255
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:23,856
But now winter
is truly coming.

256
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:26,792
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

257
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:31,263
look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.

258
00:16:32,498 --> 00:16:34,867
I don't hate her.

259
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,069
Not really.

260
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,305
I don't want
to frighten you,

261
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,174
but I won't lie
to you either.

262
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,610
We've come
to a dangerous place.

263
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:48,281
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.

264
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:51,184
All right?

265
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,154
Go on.
It's yours.

266
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,558
I can keep it?

267
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:02,761
Try not to stab
your sister with it.

268
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,703
If you're going
to own a sword,

269
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:15,605
you'd better
know how to use it.

270
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:27,047
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.

271
00:17:29,284 --> 00:17:32,886
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

272
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:36,758
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.

273
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:40,162
I could tell you about
Ser Duncan the tall.

274
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:42,164
Those were always
your favorites.

275
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,567
Those weren't
my favorites.

276
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:47,237
My favorites were
the scary ones.

277
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,843
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

278
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:56,113
Fear is for the winter,

279
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:59,117
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

280
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:01,253
Fear is for the long night,

281
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,256
when the Sun
hides for years

282
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,026
and children are born
and live and die

283
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:09,762
all in darkness.

284
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,832
That is the time for fear,
my little lord,

285
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:16,202
when the White Walkers
move through the woods.

286
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:20,740
Thousands of years ago
there came a night

287
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:22,876
that lasted a generation.

288
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,846
Kings froze to death
in their castles,

289
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,114
same as the Shepherds
in their huts.

290
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,018
And women smothered
their babies

291
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:33,187
<i>rather than see them starve,</i>

292
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:37,224
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

293
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,962
So is this the sort
of story that you like?

294
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,101
In that darkness,

295
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:48,638
the White Walkers
came for the first time.

296
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:51,807
<i>They swept through cities</i>
<i>and Kingdoms,</i>

297
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:54,009
<i>riding their dead horses,</i>

298
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:57,979
hunting with their packs of pale spiders
big as Hounds--

299
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,753
Only what what the little lord
telling wants to hear.

300
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:09,256
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.

301
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,436
One time she told me

302
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,739
the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye

303
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:27,608
of a blue-eyed giant
named Macomber.

304
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:29,877
Maybe we do.

305
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,548
How do you feel?

306
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:40,052
You still don't
remember anything?

307
00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:43,990
Bran,

308
00:19:44,024 --> 00:19:46,191
I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

309
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,093
In the wind, in the rain--

310
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:50,228
a thousand times.

311
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:52,630
- You never fall.
- I did though.

312
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:57,868
It's true, isn't it,

313
00:19:57,903 --> 00:20:01,239
what Maester Luwin
says about my legs?

314
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:10,749
I'd rather be dead.

315
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:15,255
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

316
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:29,538
Fewer eyes
back here, my Lady.

317
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:31,573
But still too many.

318
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:34,242
It's nine years since I've
set foot in the capital.

319
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,645
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came either.

320
00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:43,683
My Lady.

321
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,986
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

322
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:48,887
I would.
We've done nothing wrong.

323
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:51,223
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

324
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,058
Instructed?

325
00:20:53,093 --> 00:20:55,795
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but--

326
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,563
follow me, Lady Stark.

327
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,279
Cat!
Go on.

328
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,147
Go upstairs.

329
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:18,052
You little worm!

330
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:20,855
You take me for some
back-alley Sally

331
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,323
you can drag into a--

332
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:25,827
pssst!

333
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,898
I meant no disrespect

334
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:32,300
to you of all people.

335
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,468
How dare you
bring me here!

336
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,303
Have you
lost your mind?

337
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,973
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

338
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,543
I'm truly sorry
about the locale.

339
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:45,046
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

340
00:21:46,148 --> 00:21:48,149
A dear friend told me.

341
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:52,619
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

342
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:56,656
To see you again after so
many years is a blessing.

343
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,191
Your poor hands.

344
00:22:00,627 --> 00:22:02,228
How did you know
I was coming?

345
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:04,730
Knowledge is
my trade, my Lady.

346
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:09,067
Did you bring the dagger with you,
by any chance?

347
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:13,070
My little birds
are everywhere...

348
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,339
Even in the North.

349
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:18,909
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

350
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:26,383
Valyrian steel.

351
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,186
Do you know whose dagger
this is?

352
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,623
I must admit
I do not.

353
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:36,526
Well well, this is
an historic day.

354
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,662
Something you don't know

355
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:41,164
<i>that I do.</i>

356
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:47,003
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

357
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:51,007
- It's mine.
- Yours?

358
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:55,611
At least it was, until the tournament on
Prince Joffrey's last Nameday.

359
00:22:55,646 --> 00:22:58,481
I bet on Ser Jaime
in the jousting,

360
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,317
as any sane man would.

361
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:02,852
When the Knight of the Flowers
unseated him,

362
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:05,456
I lost this dagger.

363
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,658
To whom?

364
00:23:07,692 --> 00:23:09,560
Tyrion Lannister.

365
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:11,763
The imp.

366
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:14,599
<i>Grenn, show him what</i>
<i>you farm boys are made of.</i>

367
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:22,940
If that were a real sword,
you'd be dead.

368
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:26,243
Lord Snow here
grew up in a castle

369
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:28,579
spitting down
on the likes of you.

370
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:30,715
Pyp.

371
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:32,751
Do you think
Ned Stark's bastard

372
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:34,820
bleeds
like the rest of us?

373
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:43,762
Next!

374
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,975
<i>Next!</i>

375
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:11,289
Well, Lord Snow,

376
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:13,824
<i>it appears you're</i>
<i>the least useless person here.</i>

377
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:16,460
Go clean yourselves up.

378
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:19,397
<i>There's only so much</i>
<i>I can stomach in a day.</i>

379
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:22,400
A charming man.

380
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,535
<i>I don't need him</i>
<i>to be charming.</i>

381
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:27,238
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

382
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:29,107
into men
of The Night's Watch.

383
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:31,943
And how's that going,
commander Mormont?

384
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:34,346
Slowly.

385
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,250
A raven came

386
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:40,186
for Ned Stark's son.

387
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,260
Good news or bad?

388
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:47,995
Both.

389
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:52,432
Maester Pycelle:
<i>Lord Stark.</i>

390
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:55,469
I meant to give you this earlier.

391
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:59,807
So forgetful
these days.

392
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:04,411
A raven from Winterfell
this morning.

393
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:17,389
Good news?

394
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,362
Perhaps you'd like to share it
with your wife?

395
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,501
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

396
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,778
<i>Yes, I'm looking at you.</i>

397
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,083
I thought that she'd
be safest in here.

398
00:25:44,118 --> 00:25:47,019
One of several such
establishments I own.

399
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,724
You're a funny man.

400
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,360
Huh?
A very funny man.

401
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:55,929
Ned!

402
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,340
Ah, the Starks--

403
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:08,611
quick tempers,
slow minds.

404
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:16,086
You broke
my nose, bastard!

405
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:25,395
It's an improvement.

406
00:26:28,565 --> 00:26:31,734
If we threw you over The Wall,
I wonder how long it would take you to hit.

407
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:33,803
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

408
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,610
What're you looking at,
half man?

409
00:26:40,644 --> 00:26:43,179
I'm looking
at you.

410
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:45,481
<i>Yes.</i>

411
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:48,584
<i>You've got</i>
<i>an interesting face.</i>

412
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:52,789
Hmm, very
distinctive faces.

413
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,457
All of you.

414
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,693
And what do you care
about our faces?

415
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:59,929
It's just I think
they would look marvelous

416
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:02,599
decorating spikes
in King's Landing.

417
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:05,768
Perhaps I'll write my sister,
the Queen, about it.

418
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:10,340
We'll talk later,
Lord Snow.

419
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:18,614
Everybody knew
what this place was

420
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:20,617
and no one told me.

421
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:23,053
No one but you.

422
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:24,921
My father knew

423
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:27,224
and he left me to rot
at The Wall all the same.

424
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:28,892
Grenn's father
left him too...

425
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:32,263
Outside a farmhouse
when he was three.

426
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:36,167
<i>Pyp was caught stealing</i>
<i>a wheel of cheese.</i>

427
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:39,604
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.

428
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,375
He was given a choice:
His right hand or The Wall.

429
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:45,943
I've been asking
the lord commander about them.

430
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:47,331
Fascinating stories.

431
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:49,080
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

432
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,116
It's a lucky thing
none of them were trained

433
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,685
by a Master-at-Arms
like your Ser Rodrik.

434
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:56,554
I don't imagine any of them
have ever held a real sword

435
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,690
before they came here.

436
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:03,861
Oh...

437
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:06,931
Your brother Bran.

438
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:09,267
He's woken up.

439
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:12,637
The mere suggestion
that the queen's brother

440
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:14,972
tried to kill your boy
would be considered treason.

441
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,242
We have proof.
We have the blade.

442
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:19,410
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

443
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:22,013
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,

444
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:24,281
thanks to your boy's
wolf.

445
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:27,284
Petyr has promised
to help us find the truth.

446
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,421
He's like a little brother
to me, Ned.

447
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:32,690
He would never
betray my trust.

448
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:35,325
I'll try to keep you
alive, for her sake.

449
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,994
A fool's task, admittedly,

450
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:39,796
<i>but I've never been able</i>
<i>to refuse your wife anything.</i>

451
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,964
I won't forget this.

452
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,066
You're a true friend.

453
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:47,369
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

454
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:54,043
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

455
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:55,911
He's a child--
10 years old.

456
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:58,347
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

457
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:00,983
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

458
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:02,885
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing.

459
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:04,887
He's said nothing.
He remembers nothing.

460
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:07,056
Then what are you
raving about?

461
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,724
What if it
comes back to him?

462
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,560
If he tells his father
what he saw--

463
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:13,029
we'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

464
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:14,598
We'll say
whatever we like.

465
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:16,900
I think we can outfox
a 10-year-old.

466
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:20,170
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

467
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:22,974
They can write
a ballad about us:

468
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:25,309
"The War
for Cersei's Cunt."

469
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:32,217
- Let me go.
- Never.

470
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:34,885
- Let me go.
- The boy

471
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,187
won't talk.

472
00:29:37,222 --> 00:29:39,223
And if he does,
I'll kill him.

473
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:42,693
Him, Ned Stark, the king-
the whole bloody lot of them,

474
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:45,562
until you and I are
the only people

475
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:47,797
left in this world.

476
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,242
I wish I could
see the girls.

477
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:03,512
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

478
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:05,814
Until we know
who our enemies are--

479
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:08,050
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

480
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:10,085
In my bones,
I know it.

481
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,120
Littlefinger's right.

482
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:16,025
I can't do anything
without proof.

483
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:18,594
And if you find the proof?

484
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:20,829
Then I bring it to Robert...

485
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:23,633
And hope he's still
the man I once knew.

486
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,403
You watch yourself
on the road, huh?

487
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:30,874
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

488
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:33,744
My temper?
Gods be good,

489
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,547
you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

490
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,054
He still loves you.

491
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:46,124
Does he?

492
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:05,342
Off with you.

493
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:40,608
Yes, it's been a long time.

494
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:44,378
But I still remember
every face.

495
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,081
You remember
your first?

496
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:52,653
Of course,
Your Grace.

497
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:54,722
Who was it?

498
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:56,891
A Tyroshi.

499
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:59,193
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

500
00:31:59,227 --> 00:32:01,529
How'd you do it?

501
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:03,631
Lance through
the heart.

502
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:05,501
<i>Quick one.</i>

503
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,238
Lucky for you.

504
00:32:09,272 --> 00:32:13,143
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

505
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:17,146
<i>My horse took an arrow</i>
<i>so I was on foot,</i>

506
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:19,182
<i>slogging</i>
<i>through the mud.</i>

507
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:25,822
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

508
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,025
thinking he could end
the rebellion

509
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,593
<i>with single swing</i>
<i>of his sword.</i>

510
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:33,930
<i>I knocked him down</i>
<i>with the hammer.</i>

511
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:36,333
<i>Gods, I was strong then.</i>

512
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,203
Caved in his breastplate.

513
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:42,406
Probably shattered
every rib he had.

514
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:46,278
<i>Stood over him,</i>
<i>hammer in the air.</i>

515
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:50,649
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "wait!

516
00:32:50,684 --> 00:32:53,719
Wait."

517
00:32:58,057 --> 00:33:01,760
They never tell you
how they all shit themselves.

518
00:33:01,794 --> 00:33:06,330
They don't put that part
in the songs.

519
00:33:08,866 --> 00:33:11,368
Stupid boy.

520
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,072
<i>Now the Tarlys</i>
<i>bend the knee</i>

521
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:17,508
<i>like everyone else.</i>

522
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:19,677
He could have lingered

523
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:22,380
on the edge of the battle
with the smart boys

524
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:26,017
and today his wife would
be making him miserable,

525
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:29,021
<i>his sons would be ingrates,</i>

526
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:32,091
and he'd be waking
three times in the night

527
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,027
to piss into a bowl.
Wine!

528
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,634
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.

529
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:47,205
Lancel Lannister.

530
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:51,409
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

531
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:56,648
What are you doing?

532
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,585
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean it's empty?

533
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:03,454
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?

534
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:07,892
So get more.

535
00:34:11,563 --> 00:34:13,797
Tell your cousin
to get in here.

536
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:15,232
Kingslayer!

537
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:17,301
Get in here.

538
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:27,943
<i>Surrounded</i>
<i>by Lannisters.</i>

539
00:34:27,977 --> 00:34:32,214
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

540
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:35,517
and their smug,
satisfied faces.

541
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:38,319
It must wound
your pride, huh?

542
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:41,322
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.

543
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:46,628
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

544
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:50,333
Forced to mind the door
while your King

545
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,336
eats and drinks
and shits and fucks.

546
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,839
So come on.

547
00:34:56,874 --> 00:34:58,974
We're telling war stories.

548
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,846
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

549
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:07,716
One of the outlaws
in the Brotherhood.

550
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:10,319
I was there that day.

551
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:13,522
You were only a squire,
16 years old.

552
00:35:13,556 --> 00:35:16,458
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

553
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:18,760
Best move I ever saw.

554
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:23,031
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

555
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:25,200
<i>Your outlaw...</i>

556
00:35:25,235 --> 00:35:27,803
Any last words?

557
00:35:27,837 --> 00:35:30,672
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmmm.

558
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:33,643
What about
Aerys Targaryen?

559
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:37,613
What did the Mad King say
when you stabbed him in the back?

560
00:35:37,648 --> 00:35:39,716
I never asked.

561
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,786
Did he call you
a traitor?

562
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,990
Did he plead
for a reprieve?

563
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:50,494
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

564
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:54,364
"Burn them all."

565
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:01,070
If that's all,
Your Grace...

566
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:35,769
Do the Dothraki buy
their slaves?

567
00:36:35,803 --> 00:36:37,938
The Dothraki don't
believe in money.

568
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:40,273
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

569
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:42,542
- From whom?
- If you rule a city

570
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,511
and you see the horde approaching,
you have two choices:

571
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:47,379
Pay tribute or fight.

572
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,114
An easy choice
for most.

573
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:52,651
Of course, sometimes
it's not enough.

574
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:56,121
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

575
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:58,724
<i>He might think the men too weak</i>
<i>or the women too ugly.</i>

576
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:02,295
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months

577
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:05,632
- <i>and need the practice.</i>
- <i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.</i>

578
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:10,771
Tell them all to stop.

579
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:12,940
You want the entire
horde to stop?

580
00:37:12,974 --> 00:37:15,309
For how long?

581
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:18,378
Until I command them
otherwise.

582
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:20,780
You're learning
to talk like a Queen.

583
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:22,882
Not a Queen.

584
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,818
A Khaleesi.

585
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:37,598
Annakhas dozgosores.

586
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,792
You dare!

587
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:07,297
You give commands to me?
To <i>me?</i>

588
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:12,836
You do not command the Dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

589
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,239
I don't take orders
from savages

590
00:38:15,273 --> 00:38:17,774
or their sluts.
Do you hear me?

591
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:22,980
<i>Hash shafka zali nharees,</i>
<i>zhey Khaleesi?</i>

592
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,667
Rakharo ask if you want
him dead, Khaleesi.

593
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:27,319
No.

594
00:38:27,353 --> 00:38:29,354
<i>Ishish chare acharoe</i>
<i>hash me nem éjervae</i>

595
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:32,457
- <i>nharesoon.</i>
- Rakharo say you should take ear,

596
00:38:32,492 --> 00:38:36,161
- to teach respect.
- Please please, don't hurt him.

597
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:43,901
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.

598
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,803
<i>Khaleesi vos zalo</i>
<i>meme nem azisa.</i>

599
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:49,239
Huh?

600
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:52,975
<i>Shafki.</i>

601
00:38:56,714 --> 00:39:00,418
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!

602
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:07,526
I am your King!

603
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:12,632
Shall we return
to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?

604
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:34,785
Uh uh uh uh uh.

605
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:37,922
You walk.

606
00:42:08,116 --> 00:42:12,585
I wanted to be here when you
saw it for the first time.

607
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:24,030
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

608
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:27,333
I'm the First Ranger.

609
00:42:27,368 --> 00:42:29,636
My job is out there.

610
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:33,006
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

611
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,941
The kind I don't
want to believe.

612
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:39,079
I'm ready.
I won't let you down.

613
00:42:39,113 --> 00:42:41,648
You're not going.

614
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:45,886
You're no Ranger, Jon.

615
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,655
- But I'm better than every--
- Better than no one!

616
00:42:53,828 --> 00:42:55,695
Here...

617
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:58,064
A man gets what he earns,

618
00:42:58,098 --> 00:43:00,266
when he earns it.

619
00:43:04,205 --> 00:43:06,439
We'll speak when I return.

620
00:43:21,888 --> 00:43:25,091
- A bear's balls.
- Tyrion: Oh, you're joking?

621
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:28,662
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart

622
00:43:28,696 --> 00:43:31,198
all fried in his own fat.

623
00:43:31,232 --> 00:43:33,834
When you're a hundred miles
North of The Wall

624
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:37,370
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

625
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:40,674
And how do
a bear's balls taste?

626
00:43:40,709 --> 00:43:43,010
A bit chewy.

627
00:43:45,113 --> 00:43:48,649
And what about you, my Lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

628
00:43:48,683 --> 00:43:51,051
Do Dornish girls count?

629
00:43:55,022 --> 00:43:58,157
So you roam
the Seven Kingdoms,

630
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:00,392
collaring pickpockets
and horse thieves

631
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:02,527
and bringing them here
as eager recruits?

632
00:44:02,562 --> 00:44:04,362
Aye.

633
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:07,398
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.

634
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:10,434
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

635
00:44:10,469 --> 00:44:13,170
Some of 'em's high-born lads
looking for glory.

636
00:44:13,204 --> 00:44:15,389
They have a better chance
finding feed than glory.

637
00:44:16,774 --> 00:44:20,310
The Night's Watch is
a joke to you, is it?

638
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:22,880
Is that what we are,
Lannister?

639
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:25,749
An army of jesters
in black?

640
00:44:25,783 --> 00:44:27,918
You don't have enough men
to be an army

641
00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:31,588
and aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

642
00:44:31,623 --> 00:44:34,358
<i>I hope we've provided you</i>
<i>with some good stories to tell</i>

643
00:44:34,393 --> 00:44:36,327
<i>when you're back</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

644
00:44:36,362 --> 00:44:37,896
But something to think about

645
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,031
while you're drinking
your wine down there,

646
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,000
enjoying your brothels--

647
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:46,372
half the boys you've seen training
will die North of The Wall.

648
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:49,876
<i>Might be a Wilding's axe</i>
<i>that gets them,</i>

649
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,578
<i>might be sickness,</i>

650
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:55,447
might just be the cold.

651
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:58,183
They die in pain.

652
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:01,753
And they do it so plump
little lords like you

653
00:45:01,787 --> 00:45:05,256
can enjoy their summer afternoons
in peace and comfort.

654
00:45:07,258 --> 00:45:09,259
Do you think
I'm plump?

655
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:15,398
Listen, Benjen--
may I call you Benjen?

656
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:16,419
<i>Call me what you like.</i>

657
00:45:16,444 --> 00:45:18,630
<i>I'm not sure what I've</i>
<i>done to offend you.</i>

658
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,338
I have great admiration
for The Night's Watch.

659
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:23,941
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

660
00:45:23,975 --> 00:45:26,009
You know, my brother
once told me

661
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:28,646
that nothing someone says
before the word "but"

662
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,580
really counts.

663
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:33,117
But...

664
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:36,386
I don't believe that Giants and Ghouls
and White Walkers

665
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,221
are lurking
beyond The Wall.

666
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:40,623
I believe that
the only difference

667
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:42,925
between us and
the Wildlings is that

668
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:45,294
when The Wall went up,
our ancestors happened

669
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,562
to live on
the right side of it.

670
00:45:47,597 --> 00:45:49,497
You're right.

671
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,201
The Wildlings are
no different from us.

672
00:45:53,235 --> 00:45:56,104
A little rougher maybe.

673
00:45:56,138 --> 00:45:58,907
But they're made
of meat and bone.

674
00:45:58,942 --> 00:46:01,544
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

675
00:46:01,578 --> 00:46:05,515
It's not the Wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

676
00:46:06,651 --> 00:46:08,819
You've never been
North of The Wall,

677
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,255
so don't tell me
what's out there.

678
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,794
Are you going below?

679
00:46:18,296 --> 00:46:21,665
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

680
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,201
Oh, I always do.

681
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:34,812
I think he's starting
to like me.

682
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:41,019
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

683
00:46:41,054 --> 00:46:42,688
Into the tunnel

684
00:46:42,722 --> 00:46:44,858
and out the other side.

685
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:47,628
He'll be North of The Wall
for a month or two.

686
00:46:49,764 --> 00:46:52,933
So you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

687
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:55,536
Aye, day after tomorrow.

688
00:46:55,571 --> 00:46:59,374
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

689
00:46:59,408 --> 00:47:03,678
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

690
00:47:03,713 --> 00:47:08,751
I... I travel a bit
on the grubby side, my Lord.

691
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,139
Not this time.

692
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:12,192
We'll be staying at
the finest castles and inns.

693
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:15,558
No one turns away
a Lannister.

694
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:23,331
At Jakar?

695
00:47:23,366 --> 00:47:25,166
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

696
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,435
Ath ja haker.

697
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,403
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

698
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:31,305
<i>Athjahakar.</i>

699
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,106
Yes, Khaleesi.

700
00:47:34,876 --> 00:47:37,110
Oh, what are you doing?

701
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,746
When was last time
you bleed, Khaleesi?

702
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:44,217
You change, Khaleesi.

703
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:56,131
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade

704
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,667
is a good thing,
easier to handle.

705
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:02,171
It's a good weapon
for a Dothrakan.

706
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:04,974
But a man in full plate--

707
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,809
<i>shori tawakof</i>

708
00:48:06,844 --> 00:48:09,812
the <i>arakh</i> won't get
through the steel.

709
00:48:11,048 --> 00:48:13,149
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

710
00:48:13,184 --> 00:48:16,186
Designed for piercing plate.

711
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:23,592
- Armor.
- Armor.

712
00:48:23,626 --> 00:48:26,261
Armor make a man...

713
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:28,429
- <i>Vroz?</i>
- Slow.

714
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:30,397
- Slow.
- It's true,

715
00:48:30,432 --> 00:48:33,733
but it also keeps
a man alive.

716
00:48:51,654 --> 00:48:54,155
He still is.

717
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,658
A man of great honor

718
00:48:56,692 --> 00:48:58,660
and I betrayed him.

719
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:24,753
I don't think
she wants to eat dog.

720
00:49:28,024 --> 00:49:30,792
The Khaleesi
have baby inside her.

721
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:35,498
<i>It is true.</i>
<i>She does not bleed for two moons.</i>

722
00:49:35,532 --> 00:49:38,067
<i>Her belly start</i>
<i>to swell.</i>

723
00:49:40,004 --> 00:49:43,907
<i>She does not want to eat horse.</i>

724
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:48,213
I'll have the boys
butcher a goat for supper.

725
00:49:53,386 --> 00:49:56,054
I need to ride to Qohor.

726
00:49:58,991 --> 00:50:02,994
Uh, we ride
for Vaes Dothrak.

727
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:05,363
Don't worry.
I'll catch you.

728
00:50:05,397 --> 00:50:07,832
The horde's easy to find.

729
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,211
Don't stand so still.

730
00:50:20,245 --> 00:50:23,781
It's harder to hit
a moving target.

731
00:50:27,953 --> 00:50:30,788
Except for you.
You move too much.

732
00:50:30,822 --> 00:50:33,524
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

733
00:50:38,696 --> 00:50:41,664
Maester Aemon:
<i>How many winters have</i>
<i>you seen, Lord Tyrion?</i>

734
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:44,333
Eight-- no, nine.

735
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,902
All of them brief?

736
00:50:46,936 --> 00:50:50,171
They say the winter of my birth
was three years long, Maester Aemon.

737
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:53,241
This summer
has lasted nine.

738
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:57,611
But reports from the Citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

739
00:50:57,645 --> 00:51:00,080
The Starks are always
right eventually:

740
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:03,083
Winter is coming.

741
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:05,918
This one will be long

742
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:08,654
and dark things
will come with it.

743
00:51:08,688 --> 00:51:11,757
We've been
capturing Wildlings,

744
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:14,826
more every month.
They're fleeing south.

745
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:19,098
<i>The ones who flee say they've seen</i>
<i>the White Walkers.</i>

746
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:22,536
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport
say they see mermaids.

747
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,973
One of our own Rangers swore
he saw them kill his companions.

748
00:51:26,007 --> 00:51:28,075
He swore it right up
to the moment

749
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,011
Ned Stark
chopped his head off.

750
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,681
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

751
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,749
standing between the realm

752
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:37,051
and what lies beyond.

753
00:51:37,086 --> 00:51:39,287
<i>And it has has</i>
<i>become an army</i>

754
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:42,923
of undisciplined boys
and tired old men.

755
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:46,492
There are less than
a thousand of us now.

756
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:49,362
We can't man the other
castles on The Wall.

757
00:51:49,396 --> 00:51:52,498
<i>We can't properly</i>
<i>patrol the wilderness.</i>

758
00:51:52,532 --> 00:51:56,201
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed

759
00:51:56,236 --> 00:51:58,871
- and fed.
- Your sister

760
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:01,707
sits by the side the King.

761
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:04,610
Tell her we need help.

762
00:52:04,645 --> 00:52:06,980
<i>When winter does come,</i>

763
00:52:07,014 --> 00:52:10,450
gods help us all
if we're not ready.

764
00:53:17,187 --> 00:53:19,622
I'm sorry to see
you leave, Lannister.

765
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:23,293
It's either me
or this cold.

766
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,695
And <i>it</i> doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

767
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:28,698
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

768
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:29,966
I expect I will.

769
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,035
Gods know there aren't
many feather beds

770
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:34,203
between here
and King's Landing.

771
00:53:34,238 --> 00:53:36,372
If you see
my brother Bran,

772
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:38,942
tell him I miss him.

773
00:53:38,976 --> 00:53:41,010
Tell him I'd visit
if I could.

774
00:53:41,044 --> 00:53:42,612
Of course.

775
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:45,215
He'll never walk again.

776
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:46,916
If you're going to be
a cripple,

777
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:49,185
it's better to be
a rich cripple.

778
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,688
You take care, Snow.

779
00:53:51,722 --> 00:53:53,723
Farewell, my Lord.

780
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:08,037
You are late, boy.

781
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:12,407
<i>Tomorrow you will</i>
<i>be here at midday.</i>

782
00:54:12,441 --> 00:54:14,675
Who are you?

783
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,178
Your dancing master,

784
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,780
<i>Syrio Forel.</i>

785
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,385
Tomorrow
you will catch it.

786
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,421
Now pick it up.

787
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,026
That is not
the way, boy.

788
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:35,231
This is not a greatsword that is
needing two hands to swing it.

789
00:54:35,265 --> 00:54:39,402
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

790
00:54:39,437 --> 00:54:41,305
to make you strong.

791
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:43,741
Just so.

792
00:54:43,775 --> 00:54:46,210
One hand is all
that is needed.

793
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:49,581
Now you are standing
all wrong.

794
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:51,984
Turn your body sideface.

795
00:54:52,018 --> 00:54:54,453
Yes.

796
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:56,656
So.

797
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,024
You are skinny.
That is good.

798
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:02,061
The target is smaller.

799
00:55:02,095 --> 00:55:04,163
Now the grip--
let me see.

800
00:55:04,197 --> 00:55:06,965
Yes.

801
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,835
The grip must be
delicate.

802
00:55:10,803 --> 00:55:12,704
What if I drop it?

803
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:15,073
The steel must be
part of your arm.

804
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:17,843
Can you drop
part of your arm? No.

805
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:22,113
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

806
00:55:22,148 --> 00:55:24,916
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

807
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,718
I'm a girl.

808
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:30,322
Boy, girl--
you are a sword,

809
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:33,258
that is all.

810
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:35,694
That is the grip.

811
00:55:35,729 --> 00:55:37,897
You are not holding
a battle-axe.

812
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:40,266
- You are holding--
- A Needle.

813
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:41,301
Ahhh.

814
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,572
Just so.

815
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:48,442
Now we will begin the dance.

816
00:55:48,477 --> 00:55:49,944
Remember, child,

817
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:52,947
this is not the dance of the Westeros
we are learning--

818
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:55,116
the Knight's Dance,

819
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,551
hacking and hammering.

820
00:55:57,586 --> 00:56:00,721
This is the Bravo's Dance...

821
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:04,191
The Water Dance.

822
00:56:04,225 --> 00:56:06,460
It is swift

823
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:08,762
and sudden.

824
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:12,532
All men are made of water,

825
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:14,301
do you know this?

826
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,637
If you pierce them,

827
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:20,440
the water leaks out
and they die.

828
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:24,944
Now you will try
to strike me.

829
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:29,781
Ha!

830
00:56:41,495 --> 00:56:42,995
Up!

831
00:56:46,366 --> 00:56:47,466
Ha!

832
00:56:58,711 --> 00:57:00,078
Ah.

833
00:57:02,515 --> 00:57:04,082
Dead.

834
00:57:04,116 --> 00:57:05,216
Oh!

835
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:06,851
Dead.

836
00:57:06,886 --> 00:57:08,920
<i><i>Hup!</i>

837
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,491
Very dead.

838
00:57:13,525 --> 00:57:16,060
Come.

839
00:57:16,094 --> 00:57:17,962
Ah ah ah!

840
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:20,965
<i>Hup!</i>

841
00:57:20,999 --> 00:57:23,000
Again, faster.

842
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:29,940
Ah.

843
00:57:38,474 --> 00:57:42,374
