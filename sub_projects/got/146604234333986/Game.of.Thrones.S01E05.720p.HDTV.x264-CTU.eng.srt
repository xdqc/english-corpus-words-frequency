<i>( Men shouting )</i>

6
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:22,970
Ned: Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

7
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,195
No.

8
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:29,150
I stood vigil for him myself
last night.

9
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:32,177
He had no one else.

10
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,242
He'd never worn
this armor before.

11
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:37,511
Bad luck for him--

12
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:39,713
going against
the Mountain.

13
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:42,114
Who determines
the draw?

14
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:44,750
All the knights
draw straws, Lord Stark.

15
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:46,418
Aye.

16
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:49,655
But who holds
the straws?

17
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,225
You've done
good work, sisters.

18
00:02:57,832 --> 00:03:00,868
Life is strange.
Not so many years ago

19
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:02,871
we fought as enemies
at the trident.

20
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:05,707
I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

21
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,642
As is my wife.

22
00:03:07,677 --> 00:03:09,678
I don't think the widow's life
would suit her.

23
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:12,047
( Chuckles )
You're too modest.

24
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:14,450
I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

25
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,118
My father once told me

26
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,353
you were the best
he'd ever seen.

27
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,223
I never knew the man to be
wrong about matters of combat.

28
00:03:21,257 --> 00:03:23,559
He was a fine man,
your father.

29
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,962
What the Mad King did to him
was a terrible crime.

30
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,564
And that lad--

31
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,633
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

32
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,269
How could he afford
a new suit of armor?

33
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,771
Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

34
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,942
I hear the King wants
to joust today.

35
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,643
Yes, that will
never happen.

36
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:44,479
( Chuckles ) Robert tends to do
what he wants.

37
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:47,149
If the King got what
he wanted all the time,

38
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,785
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

39
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:57,259
It's made too small,
Your Grace. It won't go.

40
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,595
Your mother was
a dumb whore

41
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,031
with a fat ass.
Did you know that?

42
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:08,170
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

43
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,940
He can't even put a man's
armor on him properly.

44
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:13,242
You're too fat
for your armor.

45
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:16,245
Fat?
Fat, is it?

46
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,482
Is that how you speak
to your King?

47
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:24,554
( Laughing )

48
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,524
That was funny, is it?

49
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:32,261
No, Your Grace.

50
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:35,431
No?
You don't like the Hand's joke?

51
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,267
You're torturing
the poor boy.

52
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:41,103
You heard the Hand.
The King's too fat for his armor.

53
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:44,240
Go find the breastplate
stretcher-- now!

54
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:49,312
- ( Laughter )
- "The breastplate stretcher"?

55
00:04:49,346 --> 00:04:51,680
How long before
he figures it out?

56
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:53,409
Maybe you should
have one invented.

57
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:54,734
All right, all right.

58
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,519
But you watch me out there--
I still know how to point a Lance.

59
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:00,657
You have no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

60
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:04,027
Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

61
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,429
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

62
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:09,532
- And the last man in his saddle--
- Will be you.

63
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,701
There's not a man
in the Seven Kingdoms

64
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:13,669
would risk hurting you.

65
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,605
Are you telling me those
cowards would let me win?

66
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,208
Aye.

67
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,081
- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

68
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:28,683
Drink.
Your King commands it.

69
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,356
Gods,

70
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,891
too fat for my armor.

71
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,461
Your squire...
A Lannister boy?

72
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,930
Mm. A bloody idiot,

73
00:05:42,964 --> 00:05:45,065
but Cersei insisted.

74
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,535
I have Jon Arryn
to thank for her.

75
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,705
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," she told me.

76
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,609
"You'll need her father
on your side."

77
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:59,882
I thought being King meant I
could do whatever I wanted.

78
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:05,455
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

79
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:08,224
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

80
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:10,126
- Robert?
- What?

81
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:13,929
Oh.
( Laughs )

82
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:16,966
An inspiring sight
for the people, eh?

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,902
Come, bow before your King!
Bow, you shits!

84
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,670
( Polite laughter )

85
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:25,141
( Cheering )

86
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:36,986
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

87
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,424
The knight of the flowers.

88
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:50,533
Thank you, Ser Loras.

89
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:00,743
( Neighs )

90
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:14,056
( Horse fussing )

91
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,666
Don't let Ser Gregor
hurt him.

92
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,103
- Hey.
- <i>I can't watch.</i>

93
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,040
100 gold dragons
on the Mountain.

94
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:33,121
I'll take that bet.

95
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:35,011
Now what will I buy
with 100 gold dragons?

96
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:38,012
A dozen barrels
of Dornish wine?

97
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:41,081
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

98
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,370
Or you could even
buy a friend.

99
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,646
He's going to die.

100
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:47,287
Ser Loras rides well.

101
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:51,858

Such a shame,
Littlefinger.

105
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:21,554
It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

106
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:24,824
And tell me, Lord Renly,

107
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:27,360
when will you be having
<i>your</i> friend?

108
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,897
( Neighs )

109
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,674
Loras knew his mare
was in heat.

110
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,442
<i>Quite crafty, really.</i>

111
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:43,778
Ser Loras would
never do that.

112
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,141
<i>There's no honor in tricks.</i>

113
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,951
No honor and quite
a bit of gold.

Robert:
<i>Let him go!</i>

You said we were
riding for Winterfell.

132
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,470
I did...
Often and loudly.

133
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:49,806
Very wise.

134
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,642
They'll be out
in droves,

135
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:53,676
looking for me
in the wrong place.

136
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:56,380
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

He'll be offering
a handsome reward.

138

Everyone knows a Lannister
always pays his debts.

139
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:05,156
Would you be so good
as to untie me?

140
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:08,326
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

141
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,994
Am I going to run?

142
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:11,929
The hill tribes would
kill me for my boots.

143
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,731
Unless a Shadowcat
ate me first.

144
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:16,934
Shadowcats and hill tribes are
the least of your concerns.

145
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:21,104
Ah, the eastern road.

146
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,340
We're going to the Vale.

147
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,375
You're taking me
to your sister's

148
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:27,310
to answer for my
imagined crimes.

149
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:30,747
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was
the last time you saw your sister?

150
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,849
Five years ago.

151
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:35,285
She's changed.

152
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,287
She was always
a bit touched, but now--

153
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,989
you might as well
kill me here.

154
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:41,959
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I!

155
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,728
I had nothing to do with the
attempt on your son's life.

156
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:46,830
- The dagger found--
- What sort of imbecile

157
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:48,532
arms an assassin
with his own blade?

158
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,767
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

159
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,669
Am I starting
to make sense?

160
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,638
- ( Thuds, grunts )
- Catelyn: <i>Rodrik!</i>

161
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,607
( Screaming )

162
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,310
<i>My Lady, this way.</i>

163
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,097
Untie me.

164
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,499
If I die, what's the point?

165
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:28,272
( Neighs )

166
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:29,607
Ah!

167
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:37,115
( Screams )

168
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,916
( Heavy breathing )

169
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,617
Rodrik?

170
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,319
I'll be fine, My Lady.

171
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:19,055
<i>There's no need</i>
<i>to bloody yourself.</i>

172
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,291
Your first?

173
00:13:23,627 --> 00:13:25,561
You need a woman.

174
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,531
Nothing like a woman
after a fight.

175
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,469
I'm willing if she is.

176
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:34,838
( Laughing )

177
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,784
Bran.

178
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:48,786
Bran: <i>The Iron Islands.</i>

179
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,287
Sigil: A Kraken.

180
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:53,056
Words: We do not sow.

181
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:55,225
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

182
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,893
Famed for their skills
at archery,

183
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:58,728
navigation
and lovemaking.

184
00:13:58,762 --> 00:14:00,429
( Laughs )

185
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,731
And failed rebellions.

186
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:06,235
Sigil: A stag--

187
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,871
a crowned stag
now that Robert's King.

188
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:12,107
- <i>Good.</i>
- Words: Ours is the fury.

189
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,811
- Lords: The Baratheons.
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:16,846
<i>The Westerlands.</i>

191
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,949
- Sigil: A lion.
- Mmm.

192
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,356
Words: A Lannister
always pays his debts.

193
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:22,419
<i>No.</i>

194
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,757
A common saying, but not
their official motto.

195
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,826
- <i>( Arrow thunks )</i>
- Lords: The Lannisters.

196
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,762
- We're still on their words.
- I don't know them.

197
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:32,630
You do know them.
Think.

198
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,066
"Unbowed, unbent,
unbroken."

199
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,734
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

200
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:41,738
- House Hornwood.
- "Family, duty, honor."

201
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:43,740
<i>Those are Tully words--</i>
<i>your mother's.</i>

202
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:46,876
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honor...

203
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,545
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

204
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,914
Family comes first?

205
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:54,550
Your mother had
to leave Winterfell

206
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,218
to protect the family.

207
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:58,520
How can she <i>protect</i>
the family

208
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:01,223
if she's not
<i>with</i> her family?

209
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:04,660
Your mother
sat by your bed

210
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,363
for three weeks
while you slept--

211
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:09,832
and then she left!

212
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,901
When you were born,
I was the one

213
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:14,319
who pulled you
from your mother.

214
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,376
<i>I placed you in her arms.</i>

215
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,313
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

216
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:25,617
she will love you.

217
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:28,721
<i>Absolutely.</i>

218
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:32,024
- <i>Fiercely.</i>
- Why did she leave?

219
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,993
( Sighs )
I still can't tell you,

220
00:15:34,027 --> 00:15:36,195
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

221
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,164
- <i>( Arrow thunks )</i>
- Today?

222
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:39,376
No, I don't.

223
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,747
Then how can you promise me
she'll be home soon?

224
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:48,342
Sometimes I worry you're too
smart for your own good.

225
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:52,113
I'll never shoot
another arrow.

226
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:54,782
And where is that written?

227
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:57,985
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

228
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,721
If the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

229
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,755
you could learn to shoot a bow
from horseback.

230
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,824
Really

231
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,627
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

232
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:10,263
Why shouldn't you?

233
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,337
( Grunting )

234
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:24,812
( Moans )

235
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:27,882
Shh, keep it down.

236
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,485
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

237
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,988
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

238
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:36,791
Important enough
for the likes of you.

239
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:39,794
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

240
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:41,763
Who, the Imp?

241
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:43,665
I'd call him
half a nobleman.

242
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:45,533
Jealous?

243
00:16:45,568 --> 00:16:47,502
Why should I be jealous?

244
00:16:47,536 --> 00:16:50,539
Anyone with a few coppers in his
pocket can own you for the night.

245
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:53,541
What's a dwarf like
down below?

246
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,677
I've always wondered.

247
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:58,380
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

248
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:01,416
He's good
with his fingers too.

249
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:03,552
And his tongue.

250
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,254
Generous tipper.

251
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,024
I guess gold is cheap
for a Lannister.

252
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:11,059
You are jealous.

253
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:12,761
I'm a Greyjoy.

254
00:17:12,795 --> 00:17:15,030
We've been lords of the
Iron Islands for 300 years.

255
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:18,167
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

256
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:20,102
not even the Lannisters.

257
00:17:20,137 --> 00:17:22,538
And what about
the Starks?

258
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,575
I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.

259
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,211
A ward--
that's a nice word for it.

260
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:31,680
Your father rebelled
against King Robert

261
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:34,182
- and if he does it again--
- My father fought

262
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,351
for the freedom
of his people.

263
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:39,821
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

264
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:42,423
You're a very serious boy.

265
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,061
- I'm not a boy.
- Oh yes, you are.

266
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:50,131
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

267
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,734
I don't want
to pay for it.

268
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,770
Then get yourself
a wife.

269
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:01,343
- Arya: <i>Come on.</i>
- ( Meows )

270
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:05,147
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- ( Meows )

271
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:11,319
( Meows )

272
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:15,056
How is your son,
My Lord?

273
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,092
He'll never
walk again.

274
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:21,930
But his mind is sound?

275
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:24,132
So they say.

276
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,601
A blessing then.

277
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:31,607
I suffered an early
mutilation myself.

278
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:35,778
Some doors
close forever...

279
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:39,450
Others open
in the most unexpected places.

280
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,154
May I?

281
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:50,662
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

282
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,831
off comes my head.

283
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,500
And who would mourn
poor Varys then?

284
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:59,204
North or South, they sing
no songs for spiders.

285
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,773
But there are things
you must know.

286
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,876
You are the King's Hand
and the King is a fool--

287
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,145
your friend, I know,
but a fool--

288
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,147
and doomed
unless you save him.

289
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:12,482
I've been in the capital
a month.

290
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:16,452
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

291
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:18,621
I didn't trust you.

292
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,989
So why do you trust me now?

293
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:23,225
The Queen is
not the only one

294
00:19:23,259 --> 00:19:25,660
who has been
watching you closely.

295
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:28,229
There are few men of honor
in the capital.

296
00:19:28,263 --> 00:19:29,930
You are one of them.

297
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:31,999
I would like to believe
I am another,

298
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:34,001
strange as that may seem.

299
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:36,704
What sort of doom
does the King face?

300
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:39,707
The same sort
as Jon Arryn.

301
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:43,411
<i>The tears of Lys,</i>
<i>they call it.</i>

302
00:19:43,445 --> 00:19:46,047
<i>A rare and costly thing,</i>

303
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:47,816
as clear
and tasteless as water.

304
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,985
It leaves no trace.

305
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,765
Who gave it to him?

306
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,702
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

307
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,404
There were many.

308
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,140
Lord Arryn was a kind
and trusting man.

309
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,542
( Sighs )
There was one boy.

310
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,244
All he was
he owed to Jon Arryn.

311
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,081
The squire, Ser Hugh?

312
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,252
Pity what happened
to him,

313
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,356
just when his life seemed
to be going so nicely.

314
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,893
If Ser Hugh poisoned him--

315
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,728
who paid Ser Hugh?

316
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,931
Someone who could afford it.

317
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,334
Jon was a man of peace.

318
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,335
He was Hand for 17 years--

319
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,504
17 good years.

320
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,339
Why kill him?

321
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:46,777
He started
asking questions.

322
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,851
( Meows )

323
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,975
Man's voice:
<i>He's found one bastard already.</i>

324
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,143
He has the book.

325
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,179
- The rest will come.
- <i>( Lock clicks )</i>

326
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,782
Man #2: <i>And when he knows</i>
<i>the truth, what will he do?</i>

327
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,717
<i>The gods alone know.</i>

328
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,386
The fools tried
to kill his son.

329
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,556
What's worse--
they botched it.

330
00:21:35,026 --> 00:21:37,995
The wolf and the lion will
be at each other's throats.

331
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,665
- <i>We will be at war soon, my friend.</i>
- <i>What good is war now?</i>

332
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,501
We're not ready.

333
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,137
If one Hand can die,
why not a second?

334
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:48,906
This Hand
is not the other.

335
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,908
<i>We need time.</i>

336
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,578
Khal Drogo will not make his
move until his son is born.

337
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,747
You know how
these savages are.

338
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,451
<i>"Delay," you say.</i>
<i>"Move fast," I reply.</i>

339
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,787
<i>This is no longer</i>
<i>a game for two players.</i>

340
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,323
<i>It never was.</i>

341
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,578
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

342
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:31,449
I admire
your industry.

343
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,617
You do move quietly.

344
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,553
We all have
our qualities.

345
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,823
You look
a bit lonely today.

346
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,125
You should pay a visit to
my brothel this evening.

347
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,622
First boy is on the house.

348
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,794
I think you're mistaking
business with pleasure.

349
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:47,964
Am I?

350
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:51,601
All those birds that
whisper in your ear--

351
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:53,735
such pretty little things.

352
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:57,238
Trust me,

353
00:22:57,273 --> 00:23:00,074
we accommodate
all inclinations.

354
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,809
Oh, I'm sure.

355
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:05,012
Lord Redwyne likes his boys
very young, I hear.

356
00:23:05,046 --> 00:23:08,348
I'm a purveyor
of beauty <i>and</i> discretion--

357
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,051
both equally important.

358
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:13,822
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

359
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:15,557
Is it true that

360
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:18,894
Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

361
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:22,131
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

362
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,735
And I heard the most awful
rumor about a certain lord

363
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,771
with a taste
for fresh cadavers.

364
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:32,176
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

365
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,111
The logistics alone--

366
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:37,514
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

367
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,517
Strictly speaking,
such a thing

368
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,819
would not be in accordance
with the King's laws.

369
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,421
Strictly speaking.

370
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,526
Tell me--
does someone somewhere

371
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,096
keep your balls
in a little box?

372
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,565
I've often wondered.

373
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,802
Do you know I have no idea
where they are?

374
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:01,972
- And we had been so close.
- ( Chuckles )

375
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,474
But enough about me.
How have you been

376
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,476
since we last
saw each other?

377
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,279
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

378
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:10,852
Now the last time 
I saw you,

379
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:12,502
you were talking
to the Hand of the King.

380
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:15,718
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.

381
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:17,285
Council business.

382
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:20,388
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

383
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:23,424
Everyone's well aware
of your enduring fondness

384
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,359
for Lord Stark's wife.

385
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:29,363
If the Lannisters were behind
the attempt on the Stark boy's life

386
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:31,412
and it was discovered
that you helped

387
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:33,557
the Starks come
to that conclusion...

388
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:38,406
To think a simple word
to the Queen--

389
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:40,943
- one shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

390
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:43,613
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen <i>you</i>

391
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:45,515
even more recently
than you have seen me.

392
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,452
- Have you?
- Yes.

393
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,287
Earlier today,
I distinctly recall

394
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,723
seeing you talking to Lord Stark
in his chambers.

395
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,959
Was that you
under the bed?

396
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,861
And not long after that

397
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,864
when I saw you
escorting a certain

398
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,566
<i>foreign</i> dignitary...

399
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,202
Council business?

400
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,806
Of course you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

401
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,342
You're from there
yourself, after all.

402
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,712
We're friends,
aren't we, Lord Varys?

403
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,915
I'd like to think we are.

404
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,318
So you can imagine
my burden,

405
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:23,222
wondering if the King might
question my friend's sympathies.

406
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:27,293
To stand at a crossroads where
turning left means loyalty to a friend,

407
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:29,194
turning right
loyalty to the realm--

408
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,363
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

409
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:33,665
- where a simple word to the King--
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

410
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,734
What are you two
conspiring about?

411
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:39,338
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

412
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:40,906
My brother is coming.

413
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:42,608
To a small council meeting?

414
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:45,644
Disturbing news
from far away.

415
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,280
Haven't you heard?

416
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,318
<i>( Birds cawing,</i>
<i>waves breaking )</i>

417
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,215
Off with you.
No begging.

418
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,051
I'm not a beggar.
I live here.

419
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:24,487
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

420
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:26,422
I want to see my father.

421
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:29,191
I want to fuck the Queen,
for all the good it does me.

422
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:31,059
You want your father, boy?

423
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:33,261
He's lying on the floor
of some tavern,

424
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:35,363
getting pissed on
by his friends.

425
00:26:35,397 --> 00:26:37,098
My father
is Hand of the King!

426
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:40,435
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell

427
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:42,064
and if you lay a hand on me,
my father

428
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:43,628
will have both
your heads on spikes.

429
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:46,474
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

430
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,976
on the ear to help
with your hearing?

431
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:54,349
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

432
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:59,321
You promised me
this would stop.

433
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,990
They said they were
going to kill you.

434
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,493
- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

435
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:05,796
- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya. ( Sighs )

436
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:08,566
I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

437
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,569
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage--

438
00:27:11,603 --> 00:27:13,270
something about the savage.

439
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:15,672
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

440
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,111
near the dragon skulls.

441
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,471
What were you doing
in the dungeons?

442
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:22,312
Chasing a cat.

443
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:24,714
<i>( Knocks, door opens )</i>

444
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,082
Pardon, My Lord.

445
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:28,251
<i>There's a night's watchman</i>
<i>here begging a word.</i>

446
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:29,585
<i>He says it's urgent.</i>

447
00:27:36,526 --> 00:27:40,462
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

448
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:42,339
This must be your son.
He has the look.

449
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:43,464
I'm a girl!

450
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:44,949
Did Benjen send you?

451
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,800
No one sent me,
My Lord.

452
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:49,069
I'm here to find
men for the Wall,

453
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:50,865
see if there's any scum
in the dungeons

454
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,090
that might be fit for service.

455
00:27:52,174 --> 00:27:54,408
Oh, we'll find
recruits for you.

456
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:55,909
Thank you, My Lord.

457
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:58,412
But that's not why
I disturb you now.

458
00:27:59,648 --> 00:28:02,350
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black--

459
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:04,452
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

460
00:28:04,486 --> 00:28:07,422
It's for his sake
I rode here so hard

461
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:10,058
<i>I damn near</i>
<i>killed my horse.</i>

462
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:11,793
There are others
riding too.

463
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:13,896
The whole city
will know by tomorrow.

464
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,631
Know what?

465
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:19,769
Best said
in private, My Lord.

466
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,280
Go on.
We'll talk more later.

467
00:28:28,314 --> 00:28:30,915
Jory, take her
safely to her room.

468
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,085
Come along, My Lady.
You heard your father.

469
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:41,525
How many guards
does my father have?

470
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,761
Here in
King's Landing? 50.

471
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:47,164
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

472
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:50,434
No fear on that count,
little lady.

473
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:58,075
- Well?
- It's about your wife, My Lord.

474
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:01,512
She's taken the Imp.

475
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:14,158
( Neighs )

476
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:20,597
You're far from home,
Lady Stark.

477
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:22,365
To whom do I speak?

478
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,401
Ser Vardis Egan,
knight of the Vale.

479
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:26,403
Is Lady Arryn
expecting your visit?

480
00:29:26,437 --> 00:29:28,705
There was no time
to send word.

481
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:30,940
May I ask, My Lady,

482
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:33,676
why <i>he</i> is with you?

483
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,745
That's why
there was no time.

484
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:38,681
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

485
00:29:38,715 --> 00:29:42,018
My <i>sister</i> will decide
what he looks like.

486
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:44,187
Yes, My Lady.

487
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,423
She will at that.

488
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:55,898
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

489
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,234
Give me 10 good men
and some climbing spikes--

490
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:01,136
I'll impregnate the bitch.

491
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:04,739
Tyrion: I like you.

492
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:16,516
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

493
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:18,918
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

494
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:21,120
I need to see
the King first-- alone.

495
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,589
The King is at the small council
meeting, My Lord.

496
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,357
He has summoned you.

497
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,561
- Is it about my wife?
- No, My Lord.

498
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:31,531
I believe it concerns
Daenerys Targaryen.

499
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,933
The whore is pregnant.

500
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:36,903
- You're speaking of murdering a child.
- I warned you

501
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:39,406
this would happen.
Back in the North, I warned you,

502
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:41,042
but you didn't care
to hear.

503
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:43,679
Well, hear it now.

504
00:30:43,713 --> 00:30:46,983
I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

505
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:49,152
<i>And that fool Viserys</i>
<i>as well.</i>

506
00:30:49,186 --> 00:30:51,220
Is that plain enough
for you?

507
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,855
<i>I want them both dead.</i>

508
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:55,424
You will dishonor yourself
forever if you do this.

509
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:56,459
Honor?!

510
00:30:56,493 --> 00:30:59,161
I've got Seven Kingdoms
to rule!

511
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:01,964
One King,
Seven Kingdoms.

512
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:04,433
Do you think honor
keeps them in line?

513
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:06,902
Do you think it's honor
that's keeping the peace?

514
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:09,538
It's fear--
fear and blood.

515
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:11,272
Then we're no better
than the Mad King.

516
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:13,308
Careful, Ned.
Careful now.

517
00:31:13,342 --> 00:31:15,310
You want
to assassinate a girl

518
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:17,378
because the Spider
heard a rumor?

519
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:20,315
No rumor, My Lord.
The princess is with child.

520
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,116
Based on whose
information?

521
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,483
Ser Jorah Mormont.

522
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,796
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

523
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:28,255
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

524
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:31,992
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

525
00:31:32,027 --> 00:31:35,062
Jorah Mormont's
a slaver, not a traitor.

526
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:37,499
Small difference, I know,
to an honorable man.

527
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:40,202
He broke the law, betrayed
his family, fled our land.

528
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:43,106
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

529
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,108
Robert: <i>And if he's right?</i>

530
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:47,177
If she has a son?

531
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:50,346
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army...

532
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:54,050
- <i>What then?</i>
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

533
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:56,219
I'll fear the Dothraki

534
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:58,688
the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

535
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:00,823
Do nothing?

536
00:32:00,858 --> 00:32:03,026
That's your wise advice?

537
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,162
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

538
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:09,031
You're my council.
Counsel!

539
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:12,901
Speak sense to this
honorable fool.

540
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:16,938
I understand your misgivings,
My Lord.

541
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:19,641
Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing

542
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:21,742
we must consider,
a vile thing.

543
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:25,011
Yet we who presume
to rule must sometimes

544
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:28,581
do vile things for
the good of the realm.

545
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:31,818
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

546
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:33,586
the realm will bleed.

547
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,922
I bear this girl no ill will,

548
00:32:35,956 --> 00:32:38,024
<i>but should</i>
<i>the Dothraki invade,</i>

549
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:39,926
how many innocents will die?

550
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,995
How many towns
will burn?

551
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:45,231
Is it not wiser,
kinder even,

552
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,667
that she should die now

553
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:51,070
so that tens of thousands
might live?

554
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:53,606
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

555
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,074
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

556
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,444
<i>best close your eyes,</i>
<i>get it over with.</i>

557
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,881
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

558
00:33:08,787 --> 00:33:11,656
I followed you
into war--

559
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,691
twice,

560
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,961
without doubts,

561
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,930
without second thoughts.

562
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:21,568
But I will not
follow you now.

563
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,970
The Robert I grew up with

564
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:27,574
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

565
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:31,445
She dies.

566
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:34,715
I will have no part in it.

567
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:37,017
You're the King's Hand,
Lord Stark.

568
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:40,720
You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a hand who will.

569
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:50,729
And good luck to him.

570
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:53,332
I thought you were
a better man.

571
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,635
Out.
Out, damn you.

572
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:58,305
I'm done with you.

573
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:01,308
Go, run back
to Winterfell!

574
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:04,146
I'll have your head
on a spike!

575
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:08,417
Robert: <i>I'll put it there</i>
<i>myself, you fool!</i>

576
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:11,955
<i>You think you're too good for this?</i>
<i>Too proud and honorable?</i>

577
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,756
<i>This is a war!</i>

578
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:17,761
I'll go ahead
with my daughters.

579
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:19,363
Get them ready.
Do it yourself.

580
00:34:19,397 --> 00:34:21,833
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, My Lord.

581
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:24,002
Lord Baelish
is here for you.

582
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,440
His Grace went on about you
at some length

583
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:30,709
after you took your leave.

584
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:32,678
The word "treason"
was mentioned.

585
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,414
What can I do for you?

586
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,215
When do you return
to Winterfell?

587
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,558
Why? What do you care?

588
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,268
If you're still here
come nightfall,

589
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,188
I'll take you to see
the last person Jon Arryn

590
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,713
spoke with before falling ill.

591
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:46,891
If that sort of thing
still interests you.

592
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:49,494
I don't have the time.

593
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:52,163
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

594
00:34:58,103 --> 00:34:59,266
Round up all the men we have

595
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,844
and station them outside
the girls' chambers.

596
00:35:01,372 --> 00:35:04,941
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

597
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:07,677
Find them and meet me
at the stables.

598
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,585
You bring him here
without permission?

599
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,656
<i>You pollute my home</i>
<i>with his presence?</i>

600
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,492
( Suckling )

601
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:23,461
Your aunt has done
a bad thing, Robin,

602
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,297
a very bad thing.

603
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,800
You remember her,
don't you?

604
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,004
<i>Isn't he beautiful?</i>

605
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:33,807
And strong too.
Jon knew it.

606
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,876
His last words were
"the seed is strong."

607
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,411
He wanted everyone to know

608
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:41,714
<i>what a good, strong boy</i>
<i>his son would grow up to be.</i>

609
00:35:41,749 --> 00:35:45,652
Look at him,
the Lord of all the Vale.

610
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,420
Lysa,

611
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:50,524
you wrote me about
the Lannisters,

612
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:53,393
- warning me--
- To stay away from them!

613
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:56,397
Not to bring one here!

614
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:58,532
Mommy?

615
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:01,234
- Is that the bad man?
- <i>It is.</i>

616
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,270
( Creepy laugh )

617
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:06,073
He's little.

618
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:08,609
Lysa: <i>He's Tyrion the imp</i>
<i>of house Lannister.</i>

619
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:10,978
He killed your father.

620
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,713
He murdered
the Hand of the King!

621
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:15,082
Oh, did I kill him too?

622
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:16,951
I've been a <i>very</i> busy man.

623
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:19,653
You will
watch your tongue!

624
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:22,423
These men are knights
of the Vale.

625
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:25,292
Every one of them
loved Jon Arryn.

626
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:26,994
Every one of them would
die for me.

627
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:28,433
If any harm comes to me,

628
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:30,606
my brother Jaime will see
that they do.

629
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:31,805
You can't hurt us.

630
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,464
No one can hurt us here.
Tell him, mommy!

631
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:37,571
- Tell him!
- Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.

632
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:40,107
He's just trying
to frighten us.

633
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:41,975
Lannisters are all liars.

634
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,979
<i>No one will</i>
<i>hurt my baby.</i>

635
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:47,515
<i>Mommy...</i>

636
00:36:47,549 --> 00:36:50,418
I want to see
the bad man fly.

637
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,488
Perhaps you will,
my little love.

638
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:55,657
This man is <i>my</i> prisoner.

639
00:36:55,692 --> 00:36:58,694
I will <i>not</i> have him
harmed.

640
00:37:00,731 --> 00:37:02,265
Ser Vardis,

641
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:05,135
<i>my sister's guest</i>
<i>is weary.</i>

642
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:08,004
<i>Take him down below</i>
<i>so he can rest.</i>

643
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,240
Introduce him to Mord.

644
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,843
You go sleep,
dwarf man.

645
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:17,980
( Laughing ) Sleep good,
little dwarf man!

646
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,286
( Slams, lock clanks )

647
00:37:31,495 --> 00:37:34,164
( Wind gusting )

648
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:55,817
Lord Stark's lucky
he still has a head.

649
00:37:55,852 --> 00:37:58,754
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

650
00:37:58,788 --> 00:38:00,322
He adores the man.

651
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:02,124
( Surprised )
You're jealous.

652
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:04,392
Are you sure
this won't hurt?

653
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:07,695
- Only if I slip.
- <i>( Scraping )</i>

654
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:12,599
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:15,435
If you want hairless, maybe
you should find a little boy.

656
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:17,237
I want you.

657
00:38:18,906 --> 00:38:22,107
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

658
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:24,877
He treats me as if
I'm a spoiled child.

659
00:38:25,878 --> 00:38:27,979
Oh, and you're not?

660
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:31,349
Loras Tyrell,
the knight of the flowers?

661
00:38:31,383 --> 00:38:33,551
How many wars
have you fought in?

662
00:38:33,585 --> 00:38:37,055
Oh, and how much did your father
spend on that armor of yours?

663
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:39,658
Hold still.

664
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,894
All I ever hear from Robert and
Stannis is how I'm not tough enough,

665
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:44,996
how I squirm
at the sight of blood--

666
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,566
you did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

667
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,530
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

668
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:51,603
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

669
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:52,872
Easy for you to say.

670
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,474
Not everyone is such
a gifted swordsman.

671
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:58,009
( Groans ) It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

672
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,178
I'm good because
I work at it--

673
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,947
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

674
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:05,316
I could work at fighting
all day, every day,

675
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:07,252
and still never
be as good as you.

676
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:09,854
Yes well, I guess
we'll never know.

677
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:14,058
( Sighs )

678
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:21,800
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

679
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:24,469
So how did it end up?

680
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:26,103
The Targaryen
girl will die?

681
00:39:26,138 --> 00:39:29,273
It needs to be done,
unpleasant as it is.

682
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:31,508
Robert's rather
tasteless about it.

683
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,377
Every time he talks
about killing her,

684
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,580
I swear the table
rises six inches.

685
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:38,349
It's a shame he can't muster the
same enthusiasm for his wife.

686
00:39:38,383 --> 00:39:41,085
He does have a deep, abiding 
lust for her money.

687
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,254
You have to give it
to the Lannisters--

688
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:45,189
they may be the most
pompous, ponderous cunts

689
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:46,891
the gods ever suffered
to walk the world,

690
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,593
but they do have outrageous
amounts of money.

691
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,997
I have an outrageous
amount of money.

692
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:54,998
Not as much
as the Lannisters.

693
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:57,300
( Laughing )
But a lot more than you.

694
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:01,303
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

695
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:03,672
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

696
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:06,274
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

697
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:09,777
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

698
00:40:09,812 --> 00:40:12,781
Oh. But Robert
loves his killing.

699
00:40:12,815 --> 00:40:15,217
- And he's the King.
- Hmm.

700
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:18,554
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

701
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:20,890
And he used to be
good at it.

702
00:40:20,924 --> 00:40:23,893
Do you know
who should be king?

703
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:26,763
- Be serious.
- I am.

704
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:29,099
My father could be
your bank.

705
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:32,001
I've never fought in a war before,
but I'd fight for you.

706
00:40:32,036 --> 00:40:33,936
I'm fourth in line.

707
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:36,772
And where was Robert in the line
of royal succession?

708
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:38,272
Joffrey is a monster.

709
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,008
- Tommen is eight.
- Stannis?

710
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,938
Stannis has the
personality of a lobster.

711
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,145
He's still
my older brother.

712
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,481
- ( Gasps ) What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

713
00:40:46,515 --> 00:40:47,629
You cut me.

714
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,058
It's just blood.
We've all got it in us.

715
00:40:49,184 --> 00:40:51,452
Sometimes a little spills.

716
00:40:51,486 --> 00:40:54,889
If you become King, you're
going to see a lot of this.

717
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,724
You need to get used to it.

718
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:58,892
Go on. Look.

719
00:41:01,263 --> 00:41:03,497
People love you.

720
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,834
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

721
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:09,036
They want to be near you.

722
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,709
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

723
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:17,478
but you don't gloat over it.

724
00:41:17,513 --> 00:41:19,747
You don't love killing.

725
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:24,585
Where is it written
that power

726
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,387
is the sole province
of the worst?

727
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:29,489
That thrones are only made

728
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,824
for the hated
and the feared?

729
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:37,998
You would be
a wonderful King.

730
00:41:55,218 --> 00:41:58,454
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

731
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:00,389
<i>You seemed</i>
<i>so good together.</i>

732
00:42:00,424 --> 00:42:03,459
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

733
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,065
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

734
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,067
I suppose this is where
you tell me

735
00:42:12,102 --> 00:42:14,937
to give the job
to your brother Jaime.

736
00:42:14,972 --> 00:42:16,606
No.

737
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,741
He's not serious enough.

738
00:42:18,775 --> 00:42:20,710
I'll say this for Ned Stark:

739
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:22,845
He's serious enough.

740
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:26,882
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

741
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:29,018
I don't know.

742
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:34,224
But I do know this:

743
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:39,328
If the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

744
00:42:39,363 --> 00:42:43,566
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

745
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:47,136
We won't be able
to stop them.

746
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,672
<i>The Dothraki don't sail.</i>
<i>Every child knows that.</i>

747
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:52,608
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armor.

748
00:42:52,642 --> 00:42:54,610
They don't have
siege weapons.

749
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:56,478
It's a neat
little trick you do:

750
00:42:56,513 --> 00:42:59,782
You move your lips and
your father's voice comes out.

751
00:42:59,816 --> 00:43:02,951
( Huffs )
Is my father wrong?

752
00:43:06,256 --> 00:43:09,158
Let's say
Viserys Targaryen lands

753
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:12,662
with 40,000 Dothraki
screamers at his back.

754
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:15,197
<i>We hole up</i>
<i>in our castles--</i>

755
00:43:15,232 --> 00:43:17,967
<i>a wise move--</i>
<i>only a fool</i>

756
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:20,903
<i>would meet the Dothraki</i>
<i>in an open field.</i>

757
00:43:20,937 --> 00:43:23,773
They leave us
in our castles.

758
00:43:23,807 --> 00:43:27,310
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

759
00:43:27,344 --> 00:43:31,013
<i>killing every man who can't</i>
<i>hide behind a stone wall,</i>

760
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:34,083
<i>stealing all our crops</i>
<i>and livestock,</i>

761
00:43:34,117 --> 00:43:36,585
enslaving all our women
and children.

762
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:39,621
How long do the people of the
Seven Kingdoms stand behind

763
00:43:39,656 --> 00:43:43,058
their absentee King,
their cowardly King

764
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:45,526
hiding behind high walls?

765
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:48,396
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

766
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:51,065
is the rightful monarch
after all?

767
00:43:52,402 --> 00:43:54,536
We still outnumber them.

768
00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,542
Which is the bigger number:
Five or one?

769
00:44:00,444 --> 00:44:02,012
Five.

770
00:44:02,914 --> 00:44:04,682
Five...

771
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:08,086
One.

772
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,089
One army--
a real army

773
00:44:11,123 --> 00:44:14,392
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

774
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:20,698
Our purpose died
with the Mad King.

775
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:22,933
Now we've got
as many armies

776
00:44:22,968 --> 00:44:26,537
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

777
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:29,039
And everybody wants
something different.

778
00:44:29,074 --> 00:44:31,308
Your father wants
to own the world.

779
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:34,812
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

780
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:36,447
What do you want?

781
00:44:46,493 --> 00:44:50,229
We haven't had a real fight
in nine years.

782
00:44:50,263 --> 00:44:52,732
Back-stabbing doesn't
prepare you for a fight.

783
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:54,967
And that's all
the realm is now:

784
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:57,137
Back-stabbing
and scheming

785
00:44:57,171 --> 00:45:00,874
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

786
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:04,044
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

787
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:06,446
Our marriage.

788
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,314
( Laughing )

789
00:45:16,457 --> 00:45:18,992
Ah, so here we sit

790
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:21,294
17 years later,

791
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:23,963
<i>holding it all together.</i>

792
00:45:25,132 --> 00:45:27,434
Don't you get tired?

793
00:45:27,468 --> 00:45:29,569
Every day.

794
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:34,242
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

795
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:38,246
Well, 17 years
is quite a long time.

796
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,414
Yes, it is.

797
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,417
Yes, it is.

798
00:45:48,523 --> 00:45:50,624
What was she like?

799
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,428
You've never asked
about her, not once.

800
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,831
Why not?

801
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:01,201
At first, just saying
her name even in private

802
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:04,972
felt like I was breathing
life back into her.

803
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:07,207
I thought if I didn't
talk about her,

804
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:09,676
she'd just
fade away for you.

805
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:12,413
When I realized that
wasn't going to happen,

806
00:46:12,447 --> 00:46:15,149
I refused to ask
out of spite.

807
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:17,351
I didn't want to give you
the satisfaction

808
00:46:17,386 --> 00:46:20,655
of thinking I cared
enough to ask.

809
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,059
And eventually it became clear that
my spite didn't mean anything to you.

810
00:46:24,094 --> 00:46:26,996
As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.

811
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:29,232
So why now?

812
00:46:30,768 --> 00:46:34,737
What harm could Lyanna Stark's
ghost do to either of us

813
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:37,941
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

814
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:44,514
You want to know
the horrible truth?

815
00:46:47,118 --> 00:46:49,753
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

816
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,496
<i>I only know she was the one</i>
<i>thing I ever wanted...</i>

817
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:03,102
Someone took her
away from me,

818
00:47:03,137 --> 00:47:07,941
and Seven Kingdoms couldn't
fill the hole she left behind.

819
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:14,381
I felt something
for you once, you know?

820
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,283
I know.

821
00:47:17,318 --> 00:47:20,519
Even after we lost
our first boy.

822
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:24,222
For quite a while, actually.

823
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,095
<i>Was it ever</i>
<i>possible for us?</i>

824
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:32,965
Was there ever a time,
ever a moment?

825
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:41,374
No.

826
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,382
<i>Does that make you feel</i>
<i>better or worse?</i>

827
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,488
It doesn't make me
feel anything.

828
00:48:05,598 --> 00:48:08,900
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

829
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:13,338
She looks like him,
don't she, My Lord?

830
00:48:13,372 --> 00:48:17,276
She has his nose,
his black hair.

831
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,278
Aye.

832
00:48:19,312 --> 00:48:21,447
Tell him when you
see him, My Lord.

833
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:25,498
If it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

834
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,133
I will.

835
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:30,716
And tell him I've been
with no one else.

836
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:34,628
I swear it, My Lord,
by the old gods and new.

837
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,963
I don't want no jewels
or nothing,

838
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,898
just him.

839
00:48:38,933 --> 00:48:40,834
The King was always
good to me.

840
00:48:40,868 --> 00:48:43,036
When Jon Arryn
came to visit you,

841
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,937
what did he want?

842
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:47,072
He wasn't that sort
of man, My Lord.

843
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:50,275
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

844
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:52,477
healthy.

845
00:48:55,014 --> 00:48:57,215
He looks healthy
enough to me.

846
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:01,319
The girl shall want
for nothing.

847
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,762
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

848
00:49:09,796 --> 00:49:11,331
I've found.

849
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,934
Whores rarely sink.

850
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,109
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

851
00:49:21,143 --> 00:49:24,446
Well, he has more
than you, for a start.

852
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,049
- Ned: <i>How many?</i>
- <i>Does it matter?</i>

853
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:30,152
<i>If you fuck enough women,</i>
<i>some of them will give you presents.</i>

854
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:32,321
And Jon Arryn tracked
them all down. Why?

855
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:35,358
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps
Robert wanted them looked after.

856
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:38,661
He was overcome
with fatherly love.

857
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:43,199
Come.

858
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:51,440
- Jory!
- My Lord.

859
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:12,628
Such a small pack
of wolves.

860
00:50:14,498 --> 00:50:16,266
Stay back, Ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

861
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,334
<i>Was</i> the Hand
of the King.

862
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:20,003
Now I'm not sure
what he is--

863
00:50:20,037 --> 00:50:22,439
lord of somewhere
very far away.

864
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:24,908
( Running ) What's the meaning
of this, Lannister?

865
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:27,310
Get back inside
where it's safe.

866
00:50:27,345 --> 00:50:29,045
I'm looking
for my brother.

867
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,114
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

868
00:50:31,148 --> 00:50:34,817
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

869
00:50:35,986 --> 00:50:37,520
I remember him well.

870
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:39,555
It seems he had
some trouble on the road.

871
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,924
You wouldn't know what
happened to him, would you?

872
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,226
He was taken at my command

873
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,461
<i>to answer for his crimes.</i>

874
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,597
- Littlefinger: My lords!
- ( Horse neighs )

875
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:51,232
I'll bring the city watch.

876
00:50:53,835 --> 00:50:55,636
Come, Stark.

877
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:57,071
I'd rather you die
sword in hand.

878
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:59,740
- If you threaten My Lord again--
- Threaten?

879
00:50:59,775 --> 00:51:02,743
As in, "I'm going
to open your lord

880
00:51:02,777 --> 00:51:06,347
from balls to brains and
see what Starks are made of"?

881
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:08,715
You kill me,

882
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,351
your brother's
a dead man.

883
00:51:11,386 --> 00:51:13,353
You're right.

884
00:51:13,387 --> 00:51:15,822
Take him alive.
Kill his men.

885
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:19,727
( Screams )

886
00:52:24,459 --> 00:52:26,026
Yah!

887
00:52:50,987 --> 00:52:53,088
My brother, Lord Stark--

888
00:52:53,123 --> 00:52:55,524
we want him back.

889
00:53:02,299 --> 00:53:05,400
( Neighs )

890
00:53:08,737 --> 00:53:10,738
