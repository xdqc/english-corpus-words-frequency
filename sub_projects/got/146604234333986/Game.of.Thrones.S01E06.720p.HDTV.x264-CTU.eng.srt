00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,127
Your pardon, Your Grace.

4
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:29,262
I would rise, but...

5
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:31,698
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>your wife has done?</i>

6
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,202
She did nothing
I did not command.

7
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:36,970
Who'd have thought
she had it in her?

8
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,039
By what right dare you lay
hands on my blood?

9
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,634
I am the King's Hand, charged
with keeping the peace...

10
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,261
You <i>were</i> the King's Hand.

11
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,279
You shall now be held
accountable.

12
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:46,315
Oh, will both of you
shut your mouths?!

13
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:51,954
Catelyn will release Tyrion and
you'll make your peace with Jaime.

14
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,689
He butchered my men...

15
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,192
Lord Stark was
returning drunk

16
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:58,660
from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

17
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:02,264
- Quiet, woman.
- <i>Jaime has fled the city.</i>

18
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:05,233
Give me leave to bring him
back to justice.

19
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:09,004
I took you for a King.

20
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,106
- Hold your tongue.
- <i>He's attacked</i>

21
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,275
one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

22
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:15,677
I should wear the armor
and you the gown.

23
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,091
I shall wear this
like a badge of honor.

24
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:36,464
Wear it in silence
or I'll honor you again.

25
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:52,712
See what she does to me?

26
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,715
My loving wife.

27
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:03,757
I should not have
hit her.

28
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,893
That was not...

29
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,196
That was not Kingly.

30
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,635
If we don't act,

31
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,971
there will be a war.

32
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,874
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp

33
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,310
to King's Landing.

34
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,013
She's had her fun,
now put an end to it.

35
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,318
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

36
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,154
And what about
Jaime Lannister?

37
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,460
- What about Jaime?
- I'm half a Kingdom in debt

38
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,862
to his bloody father.

39
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:43,800
I don't know what happened between
you and those yellow-haired shits.

40
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,570
I don't want to know.
This is what matters...

41
00:04:46,604 --> 00:04:48,639
I can't rule the Kingdoms

42
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:51,675
if the Starks and the Lannisters
are at each other's throats.

43
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,944
So enough.

44
00:04:55,714 --> 00:04:58,283
As you command,
Your Grace.

45
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,786
With your leave,

46
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,955
I will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

47
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,891
Piss on that.
Send a raven.

48
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:07,559
I want you to stay.

49
00:05:07,593 --> 00:05:10,663
I'm the King.
I get what I want.

50
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:18,870
I never loved my brothers.

51
00:05:18,905 --> 00:05:22,608
A sad thing for a man
to admit, but it's true.

52
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,481
You were the brother
I chose.

53
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:37,324
We'll talk when I return
from the hunt.

54
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,294
The hunt?

55
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,732
Killing things
clears my head.

56
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:47,502
You'll have to sit on the
throne while I'm away.

57
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:50,238
You'll hate it more than I do.

58
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:52,006
The Targaryen girl...

59
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,609
seven hells,
don't start with her again.

60
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,479
The girl will die
and I'll hear no more of it.

61
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:01,549
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again,

62
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,686
I swear to the mother I'll pin the
damned thing on Jaime Lannister.

63
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:29,225
Khaleesi?

64
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,596
Oh, Khaleesi!

65
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,578
You're hurt.

66
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:43,467
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

67
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:45,368
When are you gonna
tell him?

68
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:47,471
Not now.

69
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:49,273
- Blood for blood.
- Bran: Come on!

70
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:51,808
You need to make the Lannisters
pay for Jory and the others.

71
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:54,144
- Robb: <i>You're talking about war.</i>
- <i>I'm talking about justice.</i>

72
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,413
Only the Lord of Winterfell

73
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:58,415
can call in the bannermen
and raise an army.

74
00:08:58,449 --> 00:09:00,717
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

75
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:03,754
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him...

76
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,657
you want me to march
on Casterly Rock?

77
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,959
- You're not a boy anymore.
- Bran: <i>Come on.</i>

78
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:10,962
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

79
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:15,200
It's your duty to represent your
House when your father can't.

80
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:18,871
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

81
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,982
Where's Bran?

82
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:36,087
I don't know.
It's not my House.

83
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:11,222
Robb?

84
00:10:11,256 --> 00:10:14,559
All alone in the deep,
dark woods.

85
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,697
I'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

86
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:21,432
I don't see him.

87
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,434
Got him hidden
under your cloak?

88
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:25,670
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

89
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:28,339
- Silver.
- We'll take the pin

90
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:31,642
and the horse.
Get down.

91
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,711
Be quick about it.

92
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,180
I can't.

93
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:38,282
The saddle...
the straps.

94
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:44,788
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

95
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:46,491
I'm Brandon Stark
of Winterfell.

96
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,760
If you don't let me be,
I'll have you all killed!

97
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:51,429
Cut his little cock off
and stuff it in his mouth.

98
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,832
The boy's
worth nothing dead.

99
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,067
Benjen Stark's
own blood?

100
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:59,371
<i>Think what Mance</i>
<i>would give us.</i>

101
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,775
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

102
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:06,011
We're going as far South
as South goes.

103
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:09,581
There ain't no White Walkers
down in Dorne.

104
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,917
Drop the knife!

105
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,920
Let him go and I'll let you live.

106
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:36,907
Robb.

107
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,844
- Robb.
- Shut up.

108
00:11:39,878 --> 00:11:42,179
Drop the blade!

109
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:44,315
- No, don't.
- Do it.

110
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,720
Are you all right?

111
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:27,490
Yes.
It doesn't hurt.

112
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,393
Tough little lad.

113
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:33,930
<i>In the Iron Islands, you're not a man</i>
<i>until you've killed your first enemy.</i>

114
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:35,565
Well done.

115
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,467
Have you lost your mind?

116
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:40,303
What if you'd missed?

117
00:12:40,337 --> 00:12:42,738
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

118
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,374
- You don't have the right...
- To what, to save your brother's life?

119
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:48,276
It was the only thing
to do, so I did it.

120
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,046
What about her?

121
00:12:57,853 --> 00:13:00,889
Give me my life,
My Lord, and I'm yours.

122
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,659
We'll keep her alive.

123
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,384
Mord!

124
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:33,654
Turnkey!
Mord!

125
00:13:34,956 --> 00:13:37,091
Mord!

126
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:43,032
Dwarf man
making noise!

127
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:47,336
How would you like
to be rich?

128
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:49,872
Dwarf man still
making noise.

129
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,442
My family is rich.

130
00:13:52,476 --> 00:13:54,210
We have gold,
lots of gold.

131
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:56,779
I'm prepared to give you
lots of gold in...

132
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:01,317
No gold!

133
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:03,352
Well, I don't
have it here.

134
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:05,788
No gold.

135
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:07,523
Fuck off.

136
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:35,686
I don't want
to practice today.

137
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,054
No?

138
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:40,491
They killed Jory.

139
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:43,427
My father is hurt.

140
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:45,963
I don't care about
stupid wooden swords.

141
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,831
You are troubled.

142
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:49,533
- Yes.
- <i>Good!</i>

143
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,802
Trouble is the perfect
time for training.

144
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:55,139
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

145
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:57,108
this is not
when fighting happens.

146
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,411
I don't like
dolls and k...

147
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,347
<i>You're not here.</i>

148
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:05,351
<i>You're with</i>
<i>your trouble.</i>

149
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:08,120
If you are with your trouble
when fighting happens...

150
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,994
...More trouble for you.

151
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,229
<i>Just so.</i>

152
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,299
How can you be
quick as a snake...

153
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:26,505
...Or as quiet
as a shadow...

154
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:33,579
...When you are
somewhere else?

155
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:38,217
You are fearing
for your father, hmm?

156
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,721
That is right.

157
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:45,991
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

158
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,330
There is only one God

159
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,267
and his name is Death.

160
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:56,303
And there is only one thing
we say to Death:

161
00:15:57,438 --> 00:15:59,406
"Not today."

162
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:10,018
<i>Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>

163
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,621
- Priestess: Khalakka Dothrae!
- <i>Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>

164
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:15,056
- <i>Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>
- <i>Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

165
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,900
She has to eat
the whole heart?

166
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:29,736
I hope that wasn't
my horse.

167
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,605
She's doing well.

168
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,640
She'll never
keep it down.

169
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,809
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!

170
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,345
<i>Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

171
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:55,097
<i>Khalakka Dothrae!</i>

172
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,967
Tell me what she's saying.

173
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,503
"The prince is riding.

174
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,538
I have heard the thunder
of his hooves.

175
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:06,974
Swift as the wind he rides.

176
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:11,278
His enemies
will cower before him...

177
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:16,249
And their wives will
weep tears of blood."

178
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,123
She's going
to have a boy.

179
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,496
He won't be
a real Targaryen.

180
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,932
He won't be
a true Dragon.

181
00:18:20,318 --> 00:18:23,287
<i>Vezh fin saja</i>
<i>rhaesheseres!</i>

182
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:26,423
"The stallion
who mounts the world."

183
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,460
The stallion is
the Khal of Khals.

184
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:32,596
He shall unite the people
into a single Khalasar.

185
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:35,999
<i>All the people of the world</i>
<i>will be his herd.</i>

186
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,235
<i>...Rhaesheseres!</i>

187
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:40,437
<i>Rhaesheseres!</i>

188
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:51,148
Rhaego! Rhaego!

189
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:53,317
Rhaego! Rhaego!

190
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:56,119
Rhaego!
Rhaego...

191
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,860
They love her.

192
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:08,696
Rhaego! Rhaego!

193
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,466
Rhaego!
Rhaego...

194
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:31,954
She truly is
a queen today.

195
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:03,751
Don't let them see you
carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.

196
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,919
You know the law.

197
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:07,921
It's not my law.

198
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:09,924
They don't belong to you.

199
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,360
Whatever is hers
is also mine.

200
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:15,030
Once, perhaps.

201
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,802
If I sell one egg,
I'll have enough to buy a ship.

202
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:22,004
Two eggs... a ship
and an army.

203
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,341
- And you have all three.
- I need a large army.

204
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:29,513
I'm the last hope
of a dynasty, Mormont.

205
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:31,682
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

206
00:20:31,716 --> 00:20:34,218
on my shoulders since
I was five years old...

207
00:20:34,252 --> 00:20:37,254
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent.

208
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:39,156
Never.

209
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,424
Not a piece of it.

210
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:44,127
How can I carry
what I need to carry without it?

211
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,862
Hmm?

212
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:48,330
Who can rule without wealth
or fear or love?

213
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,573
Oh, you stand there,
all nobility and honor.

214
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,446
You don't think I see you looking
at my little sister, hmm?

215
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,016
Don't think I know
what you want?

216
00:21:08,053 --> 00:21:10,956
I don't care.
You can have her.

217
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,258
She can be Queen
of the savages and dine

218
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:15,227
on the finest
bloody horseparts,

219
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:18,063
and you can dine on whichever
parts of her you like.

220
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:21,733
But let me go.

221
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:25,403
You can go.

222
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,271
You can't have the eggs.

223
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,072
You swore
an oath to me.

224
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:31,608
Does loyalty
mean nothing to you?

225
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,810
It means everything to me.

226
00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:35,845
And yet here you stand.

227
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,980
And yet here I stand.

228
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:56,533
Mord!

229
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,801
Mord!

230
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,072
Mord!

231
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,811
Mord!

232
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:11,614
Mord.

233
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,650
Noise again!

234
00:22:17,054 --> 00:22:19,856
- About the gold...
- No gold!

235
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:22,326
- No gold.
- Listen to me!

236
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,428
Listen to me.

237
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:26,664
Sometimes possession

238
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:28,800
is an abstract concept...

239
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:33,372
When they captured me,
they took my purse,

240
00:22:33,406 --> 00:22:35,374
but the gold
is still mine.

241
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:37,176
Where?

242
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,311
Where?
I don't know where,

243
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:40,645
but when they free me...

244
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,080
You want free?

245
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:45,350
Go be free.

246
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:48,786
Have you ever
heard the phrase

247
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,754
"rich as a Lannister"?

248
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:55,359
<i>Of course you have!</i>

249
00:22:55,393 --> 00:22:58,329
You're a smart man.

250
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:01,199
You know who
the Lannisters are.

251
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:05,069
I am a Lannister.

252
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:08,773
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

253
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:12,879
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

254
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:16,249
"a Lannister always
pays his debts."

255
00:23:18,052 --> 00:23:20,620
If you deliver
a message from me...

256
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:25,091
to Lady Arryn,
I will be in your debt.

257
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,196
I will owe you gold.

258
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,699
If you deliver
the message

259
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:36,570
and I live, which I very much
intend to do.

260
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,008
What message?

261
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:50,317
Tell her I wish
to confess my crimes.

262
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:59,727
You wish to confess
your crimes?

263
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:01,396
Yes, My Lady.

264
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,964
I do, My Lady.

265
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:06,334
The sky cells
always break them.

266
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,570
Speak, Imp.

267
00:24:08,605 --> 00:24:11,006
Meet your gods
as an honest man.

268
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:19,448
Where do I begin,
my lords and ladies?

269
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,618
I'm a vile man,

270
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:24,553
I confess it.

271
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:27,589
My crimes and sins
are beyond counting.

272
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:30,759
<i>I have lied</i>
<i>and cheated...</i>

273
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:34,229
<i>gambled and whored.</i>

274
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,900
<i>I'm not particularly</i>
<i>good at violence,</i>

275
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:41,370
but I'm good at convincing
others to do violence for me.

276
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:46,142
You want specifics,
I suppose.

277
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:50,080
When I was seven
I saw a servant girl

278
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,082
bathing in the river.

279
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,984
I stole her robe.

280
00:24:54,018 --> 00:24:56,352
She was forced to return
to the castle

281
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:58,387
naked and in tears.

282
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,723
If I close my eyes,

283
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:04,960
I can still see her tits bouncing.

284
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:11,465
When I was 10 I stuffed
my Uncle's boots with goatshit.

285
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,901
<i>When confronted</i>
<i>with my crime,</i>

286
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:16,404
I blamed a squire.
Poor boy was flogged

287
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,673
and I escaped justice.

288
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,475
<i>When I was 12</i>

289
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,511
I milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

290
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:26,582
I flogged the one-eyed snake.

291
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:28,617
I skinned my sausage.

292
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,854
I made the bald man cry

293
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:33,890
<i>into the turtle stew,</i>

294
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:35,925
which I do believe
my sister ate.

295
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,894
<i>At least I hope she did.</i>

296
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:40,262
Once I brought a jackass
and a honeycomb

297
00:25:40,297 --> 00:25:42,464
- into a brothel...
- Silence!

298
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,099
What happened next?

299
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:48,135
What do you think
you're doing?

300
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,104
Confessing my crimes.

301
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:52,673
Lord Tyrion,
you are accused

302
00:25:52,707 --> 00:25:56,177
of hiring a man to slay
my son Bran in his bed,

303
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:59,014
<i>and of conspiring to murder</i>
<i>my sister's husband</i>

304
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:02,885
Lord Jon Arryn,
the Hand of the King.

305
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:05,254
Oh, I'm very sorry.

306
00:26:06,423 --> 00:26:08,358
I don't know anything
about all that.

307
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:11,729
You've had
your little joke.

308
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:14,132
I trust you enjoyed it.

309
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:17,035
Mord, take him back
to the dungeon.

310
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:19,403
But this time find
a smaller cell...

311
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:21,539
With a steeper floor.

312
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:24,342
Is this how justice

313
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,244
is done in the Vale?

314
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:28,846
<i>You accuse me</i>
<i>of crimes,</i>

315
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:32,049
I deny them,
so you throw me into a cell

316
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,951
<i>to freeze and starve?</i>

317
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:36,921
Where is
the King's Justice?

318
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:40,325
I am accused
and demand a trial!

319
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:43,996
If you're tried
and found guilty,

320
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:47,133
then by the King's own laws
you will pay with your life.

321
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:50,270
I understand the law.

322
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:52,872
We have no executioner
in the Eyrie.

323
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:55,709
Life is more elegant here.

324
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:57,677
Open the moon door.

325
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,299
<i>You want a trial,</i>
<i>My Lord Lannister.</i>

326
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,334
Very well.

327
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:26,337
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

328
00:27:26,372 --> 00:27:28,639
and you will hear
his judgment.

329
00:27:28,674 --> 00:27:30,775
Then you will leave...

330
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,944
By one door
or the other.

331
00:27:32,978 --> 00:27:36,180
No need to bother
Lord Robin.

332
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:39,851
I demand a trial by combat.

333
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:50,361
You have that right.

334
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,331
My Lady, I beg the honor.

335
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,333
Let me be your champion.

336
00:27:55,367 --> 00:27:57,768
The honor should be mine.

337
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,037
For the love I bore
your Lord husband,

338
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:01,873
let me avenge his death.

339
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:04,442
- <i>I'll fight for you, My Lady.</i>
- It'll be my honor.

340
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,811
- The honor should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

341
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,782
Ser Vardis...

342
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,985
You're quiet.

343
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,919
Don't you want
to avenge my husband?

344
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:20,491
With all my heart,
My Lady.

345
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:22,459
But the Imp
is half my size.

346
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,628
It would be shameful to slaughter
such a man and call it justice.

347
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,731
Agreed.

348
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:30,700
You demanded
a trial by combat.

349
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:34,070
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.

350
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:36,072
My Lady,

351
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:39,576
I will gladly fight
the Imp's champion for you.

352
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:42,112
I wouldn't be
too glad, Ser.

353
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:44,648
I name my brother
Jaime Lannister.

354
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,883
<i>The Kingslayer</i>

355
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,885
is hundreds of miles
from here.

356
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,521
Send a raven for him.
I'm happy to wait.

357
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:54,591
The trial will be today.

358
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,097
Do I have a volunteer?

359
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:10,475
Anyone?

360
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,511
Anyone?

361
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:17,749
I think we can assume
that no one is willing...

362
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,818
I'll stand
for the dwarf.

363
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,430
More wine, Your Grace?

364
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,868
- What was I saying?
- Renly: Simpler time.

365
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:41,239
It was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

366
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:42,974
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

367
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:46,478
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right  in the open,

368
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:50,716
vicious as you like, all but
sending you a bloody invitation.

369
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:52,719
Nothing like today.

370
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:55,621
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

371
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:58,023
Not as exhilarating
as those balls

372
00:29:58,058 --> 00:30:00,459
and masquerades
you like to throw.

373
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:07,865
You ever fuck
a Riverlands girl?

374
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:09,533
Once.
I think.

375
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:13,370
You think?
I think you'd remember.

376
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:16,339
Back in our day,
you weren't a real man

377
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:19,476
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

378
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:21,245
and the Riverlands.

379
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,515
- We used to call it "making the eight."
- Those were some <i>lucky</i> girls.

380
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:26,584
You ever make
the eight, Barristan?

381
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,586
I don't believe so,
Your Grace.

382
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,488
Those were the days.

383
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:32,290
Which days, exactly?

384
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:35,827
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

385
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:39,097
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

386
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:42,033
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

387
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:45,436
Or way before that, when dragons
burned whole cities to the ground?

388
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,638
Easy, boy.

389
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:50,641
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the King.

390
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,410
I suppose it was all
rather heroic...

391
00:30:52,444 --> 00:30:55,279
If you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

392
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:57,948
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

393
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:03,922
More wine, Your Grace?

394
00:31:19,974 --> 00:31:23,810
<i>They burned most everything</i>
<i>in the Riverlands:</i>

395
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:28,014
<i>Our fields;</i>
<i>Our granaries;</i>

396
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:30,450
our homes.

397
00:31:30,484 --> 00:31:34,620
<i>They took our women,</i>
<i>then they took 'em again.</i>

398
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:37,256
When they was done,
they butchered them

399
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:39,092
as if they was animals.

400
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:41,261
They covered our children

401
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:43,097
in pitch

402
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:45,032
and lit them on fire.

403
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,202
Brigands, most likely.

404
00:31:48,237 --> 00:31:50,606
They weren't thieves.

405
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,242
They didn't steal
nothing.

406
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:56,678
They even left something behind,
Your Grace.

407
00:31:56,713 --> 00:32:00,115
It's the King's Hand
you're addressing, not the King.

408
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:02,083
The King is hunting.

409
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:13,394
Fish.
The Sigil of House Tully.

410
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:17,198
Isn't that your wife's house...
Tully, My Lord Hand?

411
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:25,272
These men,
were they flying a Sigil?

412
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:29,076
- A banner?
- None, your...

413
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,711
Hand.

414
00:32:30,745 --> 00:32:32,579
<i>The one who was</i>
<i>leading them...</i>

415
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:36,117
Taller by a foot
than any man I've ever met,

416
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:39,487
saw him cut
the blacksmith in two,

417
00:32:39,521 --> 00:32:41,922
saw him take the head
off a horse

418
00:32:41,957 --> 00:32:44,459
with a single swing
of his sword.

419
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:47,028
That sounds like
someone we know.

420
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:49,164
The Mountain.

421
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:52,267
You're describing
Ser Gregor Clegane.

422
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:55,270
Why should Ser Gregor
turn brigand?

423
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:57,471
The man is
an anointed knight.

424
00:32:57,506 --> 00:33:00,574
I've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

425
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:02,844
I'm sure you have
as well.

426
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,879
Can you think
of any reason

427
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:06,714
the Lannisters
might possibly have

428
00:33:06,748 --> 00:33:08,416
for being angry
with your wife?

429
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,218
Maester Pycelle:
<i>If the Lannisters</i>

430
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:13,554
were to order attacks
on villages

431
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:15,823
under the King's
protection,

432
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:18,626
- it would be...
- That would be almost as brazen

433
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,695
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

434
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,132
Well...

435
00:33:27,904 --> 00:33:30,272
I cannot give you
back your homes

436
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:33,008
<i>or restore</i>
<i>your dead to life,</i>

437
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:35,010
but perhaps I can
give you justice

438
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,679
<i>in the name of our King,</i>
<i>Robert.</i>

439
00:33:37,714 --> 00:33:41,049
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

440
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:48,790
You shall have the command.
Assemble 100 men

441
00:33:48,824 --> 00:33:52,527
- and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
- As you command.

442
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:02,737
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

443
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:02,771
the first of his name,

444
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:06,642
King of the Andals and the first men,
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

445
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:08,911
and protector of the realm,

446
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,180
I charge you to bring
the King's Justice

447
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,250
to the false knight
Gregor Clegane

448
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,752
and all those
who shared in his crimes.

449
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,688
I denounce him

450
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,690
and attaint him.

451
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,026
I strip him of all
ranks and titles,

452
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,729
<i>of all lands and holdings,</i>

453
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,133
- and sentence him to death.
- My Lord...

454
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,135
This... this is
a drastic action.

455
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,938
It would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

456
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,407
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My Lord.

457
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:40,811
Send a raven
to Casterly Rock.

458
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,181
Inform Tywin Lannister that
he has been summoned to court

459
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,283
<i>to answer for the crimes</i>
<i>of his bannermen.</i>

460
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:50,454
He will arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown

461
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:54,158
and a traitor
to the realm.

462
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,142
A bold move, My Lord,
and admirable.

463
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,711
But is it wise
to yank the lion's tail?

464
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:16,248
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

465
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,319
Gold wins wars,
not soldiers.

466
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:22,688
Then how come
Robert is King

467
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:25,024
and not Tywin Lannister?

468
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:01,061
<i>Hold!</i>

469
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:03,331
<i>- Attack attack!</i>
<i>- Come on, Ser Vardis!</i>

470
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:06,334
<i>Attack!</i>

471
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:12,139
Stand and fight, coward!

472
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:15,204
Yes!

473
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:20,877
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

474
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:42,199
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Get up!</i>

475
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:45,302
<i>Get up, get up,</i>
<i>get up!</i>

476
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:49,540
<i>Raise your sword.</i>
<i>Raise it!</i>

477
00:37:52,844 --> 00:37:54,445
Get up, man!

478
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,180
- <i>On your feet!</i>
- <i>Get up!</i>

479
00:37:56,214 --> 00:37:58,849
<i>Get up and fight,</i>
<i>Ser Vardis!</i>

480
00:38:12,796 --> 00:38:15,631
<i>No! Have mercy!</i>

481
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:42,460
Is it over?

482
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:49,533
You don't fight
with honor!

483
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,804
No.

484
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:57,741
He did.

485
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:13,523
Can I make
the little man fly now?

486
00:39:13,558 --> 00:39:15,492
Not this little man.

487
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:17,894
This little man
is going home.

488
00:39:19,998 --> 00:39:21,998
I believe you have
something of mine.

489
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:44,822
A Lannister always
pays his debts.

490
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:02,173
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

491
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:09,647
Well, why shouldn't I?
We're in the South.

492
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:13,018
It's important to remember where
you come from.

493
00:40:13,052 --> 00:40:16,288
I'm not sure your mother would
like these new styles.

494
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:19,025
My mother isn't
<i>from</i> the North.

495
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:22,228
I'm aware of that.

496
00:40:22,262 --> 00:40:24,063
Why do you care?

497
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:25,765
Do you even have hair
under there?

498
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:29,234
Yes.
I have hair.

499
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,037
I've never seen it.

500
00:40:31,071 --> 00:40:33,205
Would you like to?

501
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,275
No.

502
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:39,846
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

503
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:44,250
I come from a very
small village in...

504
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:45,552
Oh, wait.

505
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:48,021
I just realized
I don't care.

506
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,290
- Sansa...
- Septa.

507
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:53,760
Now you are being rude.

508
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:01,601
My prince.

509
00:41:03,905 --> 00:41:05,872
My prince.

510
00:41:05,907 --> 00:41:07,507
My Lady.

511
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:11,077
I fear I have
behaved monstrously

512
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:13,980
the past few weeks.

513
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:18,150
With your permission?

514
00:41:30,562 --> 00:41:33,230
It's beautiful,

515
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:35,332
like the one
your mother wears.

516
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:37,334
You'll be queen someday.

517
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:40,170
It's only fitting
you should look the part.

518
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,345
Will you forgive me
for my rudeness?

519
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,316
There's nothing to forgive.

520
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:54,721
You're My Lady.

521
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:57,924
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

522
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:01,894
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

523
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:04,196
from the last hearth
in the North

524
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,166
to the Salt Shore
in the South,

525
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,436
and you will be Queen
over all of them.

526
00:42:13,673 --> 00:42:16,107
<i>I'll never</i>
<i>disrespect you again.</i>

527
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:19,344
I'll never be cruel
to you again.

528
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:21,680
Do you understand me?

529
00:42:23,516 --> 00:42:25,751
You're My Lady now,

530
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:29,221
from this day

531
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,024
until my last day.

532
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,216
Stop.

533
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:58,819
- Stop!
- Whoa.

534
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:02,755
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

535
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,891
In a turnip cart?

536
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:07,927
I'll find a ship heading
south in White Harbor.

537
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:10,796
And you can afford that?

538
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,531
Some of my friends are more
generous than others.

539
00:43:13,566 --> 00:43:16,234
There's a thousand
girls like you in King's Landing.

540
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,536
So I'll have
lots of company.

541
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:20,272
Yes, you'll be
very popular...

542
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,007
Until some fat lord
comes to visit

543
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,909
with a big belly
and a little prick

544
00:43:23,944 --> 00:43:26,446
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

545
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,349
And what will happen
to me if I stay here?

546
00:43:29,383 --> 00:43:31,318
Will I become
Lady Greyjoy,

547
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:34,422
- mistress of the Iron Islands?
- Don't be a fool.

548
00:43:34,456 --> 00:43:36,590
I hear Jaime Lannister
attacked Lord Stark

549
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,392
in the streets
of King's Landing.

550
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:42,296
Every man for a hundred miles will be
marching off to war soon

551
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,297
and most of them
will never come back.

552
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:46,333
There's nothing left
for me here.

553
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:49,669
Let's go, Stefon.

554
00:43:49,703 --> 00:43:51,170
<i>Giddyup.</i>

555
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:53,472
Let me see it
one more time!

556
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,807
See what?

557
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:09,320
I'm going to miss you.

558
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,222
I know.

559
00:44:25,002 --> 00:44:27,037
I'm sending you both
back to Winterfell.

560
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:28,471
- What?!
- Listen...

561
00:44:28,505 --> 00:44:31,107
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

562
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:32,420
<i>Is that why</i>
<i>you're sending us home?</i>

563
00:44:32,445 --> 00:44:33,609
What? No.

564
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,044
Please, father.
Please don't.

565
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:37,246
You can't.
I've got my lessons with Syrio.

566
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,881
I'm finally
getting good.

567
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:41,350
This isn't
a punishment.

568
00:44:41,384 --> 00:44:43,786
I want you back in Winterfell
for your own safety.

569
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,254
Can we take Syrio
back with us?

570
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,860
Who cares about your
stupid dancing teacher?

571
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,185
I can't go.

572
00:44:48,192 --> 00:44:50,060
I'm supposed to marry
Prince Joffrey.

573
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:51,996
I love him and I'm meant
to be his Queen

574
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,632
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

575
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,300
When you're old enough,

576
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:59,036
I'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

577
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,739
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong...

578
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:05,043
I don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. I want him!

579
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,846
He'll be the greatest
King that ever was, a golden lion,

580
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,648
and I'll give him
sons with beautiful blond hair.

581
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:13,318
<i>The lion'sot</i>
<i>s Sigil, idiot.</i>

582
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:15,153
He's a stag,
like his father.

583
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:18,089
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk King.

584
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:24,129
Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start
packing your things.

585
00:45:24,163 --> 00:45:25,665
- Wait!
- Come on.

586
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:27,333
But it's not fair!

587
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,773
"Lord Orys Baratheon,
black of hair."

588
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,679
"Axel Baratheon,
black of hair."

589
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:13,583
"Lyonel Baratheon,
black of hair."

590
00:46:14,953 --> 00:46:17,721
"Steffon Baratheon,
black of hair."

591
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,761
"Robert Baratheon,
black of hair."

592
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:29,965
"Joffrey Baratheon...

593
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:33,134
Golden-haired."

594
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,602
Daenerys!

595
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:10,873
Where's my sister?

596
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:12,075
Stop him.

597
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:13,643
<i>Where is she?</i>

598
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:15,812
<i>Hmm?</i>

599
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:21,050
Where is she?
I'm here for the feast.

600
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,387
- The whore's feast?
- Come.

601
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:26,088
Get your hands off me!

602
00:47:26,122 --> 00:47:28,657
No one touches
the Dragon!

603
00:47:29,525 --> 00:47:31,693
<i>Khal rhae mhar!</i>

604
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:34,495
Me ifa!

605
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:39,601
Khal Drogo!

606
00:47:39,636 --> 00:47:42,104
I'm here for the feast.

607
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,910
<i>Nevakhi vekha ha maan.</i>

608
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:49,312
Khal Drogo says
there is a place for you.

609
00:47:49,347 --> 00:47:51,548
Back there.

610
00:47:53,785 --> 00:47:56,020
That is no place
for a King.

611
00:47:56,054 --> 00:47:58,722
You are no King.

612
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,125
Keep away from me!

613
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,161
Viserys, please.

614
00:48:07,297 --> 00:48:09,198
There she is.

615
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,404
Put the sword down.
They'll kill us all.

616
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:19,074
They can't kill us.

617
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:23,111
They can't shed blood
in their sacred city.

618
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:31,621
But I can.

619
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:43,800
I want what I came for.

620
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,236
I want the crown
he promised me.

621
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:49,005
He bought you.

622
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,173
But he never
paid for you.

623
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:59,448
Tell him I want what was bargained
for or I'm taking you back.

624
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:03,119
He can keep the baby.

625
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:05,454
I'll cut it out
and leave it for him.

626
00:49:08,692 --> 00:49:11,928
<i>Anha vazhak maan</i>

630
00:49:23,373 --> 00:49:25,107
He says yes.

631
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:29,444
You shall have
a golden crown...

632

That men shall tremble
to behold.

633
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:46,995
That was all I wanted.

634
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:51,499
What-what was promised.

637
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:15,990
No!
You cannot touch me.

638
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:18,359
I am the Dragon.
I am the Dragon!

639
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:21,162
I want my crown!
Ahh!

640
00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:24,366
<i>Ammeni haz jolin!</i>

641
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,712
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

642
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:45,054
<i>No, dany.</i>

643
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:46,555
Dany, tell them.

644
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:48,023
Make them!

645
00:50:49,025 --> 00:50:51,794
<i>Dany, make them...</i>

646
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:55,564
No, you can't!

647
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:58,734
Just... please!

648
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:01,703
Dany, please!

649
00:51:03,306 --> 00:51:05,808
A crown for a King.

650
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:23,159
Khaleesi?

651
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:25,395
He was no Dragon.

652
00:51:26,564 --> 00:51:29,200
Fire cannot kill a Dragon.

653
00:51:34,097 --> 00:51:38,097
