1
00:00:00,646 --> 00:00:02,962
He's attacked one of my
brothers and abducted the other.

2
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:04,961
Tell your wife to return

3
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:07,785
that little shit of an Imp
to King's Landing.

4
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:09,577
What about
Jaime Lannister?

5
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:13,116
I'm half a kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,845
We'll talk when I return
from the hunt.

7
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:16,060
The hunt?

8
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:18,105
<i>You'll have to sit on</i>
<i>the throne while I'm away.</i>

9
00:00:18,108 --> 00:00:20,093
You are accused of hiring

10
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,797
a man to slay my son
Bran in his bed.

11
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,899
I demand
a trial by combat.

12
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:27,803
- You have that right.
- Do I have a volunteer?

13
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:30,774
I'll stand for the dwarf.

14
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:34,111
Grand Maester Pycelle.
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

15
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:36,982
Inform Tywin Lannister that
he has been summoned to court

16
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,418
<i>to answer for the crimes</i>
<i>of Gregor Clegane</i>

17
00:00:39,453 --> 00:00:41,521
or be branded an enemy
of the Crown

18
00:00:41,556 --> 00:00:43,556
<i>and a traitor to the realm.</i>

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,025
Fight!

20
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,365
I'm sending you both
back to Winterfell.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,600
What? I'm supposed to marry
Prince Joffrey.

22
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:00,202
<i>He'll be the greatest king</i>
<i>that ever was, a golden lion.</i>

23
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:03,171
And I'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.

24
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,739
"Lord Orys Baratheon,
black of hair."

25
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,941
"Axel Baratheon,
black of hair."

26
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:10,377
"Robert Baratheon,
black of hair."

27
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:13,915
"Joffrey Baratheon,
golden-haired."

28
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,253
I want what I came for.
I want the crown he promised me.

29
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:22,159
- No, Dany, please!
- A crown for a king.

30
00:01:25,364 --> 00:01:27,831
Fire cannot kill a dragon.

38
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,236
Poor Ned Stark...

39
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,339
Brave man,
terrible judgment.

40
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:56,447
Attacking him was stupid.

41
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,923
Lannisters

42
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,726
don't act like fools.

43
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:16,699
Are you gonna say
something clever?

44
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,636
Go on,
say something clever.

45
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:25,706
Catelyn Stark
took my brother.

46
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:32,078
Why is he still alive?

47
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:34,981
- Tyrion?
- Ned Stark.

48
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,683
One of our men
interfered,

49
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:41,120
<i>speared him through the leg</i>
<i>before I could finish him.</i>

50
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:43,455
Why is he still alive?

51
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:49,161
- It wouldn't have been clean.
- Clean.

52
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:51,693
You spend too much time
worrying about

53
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:53,146
what other people think of you.

54
00:04:53,147 --> 00:04:55,569
I could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

55
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>That's</i> what you want
people to think of you.

56
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,842
It's the truth.

57
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,763
When you hear them
whispering

58
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:03,988
"Kingslayer"
behind your back--

59
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,182
<i>doesn't it bother you?</i>

60
00:05:08,118 --> 00:05:10,452
Of course
it bothers me.

61
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:12,454
The lion doesn't
concern himself

62
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:14,622
with the opinions
of the sheep.

63
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:19,926
I suppose I should be grateful
that your vanity

64
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,962
got in the way
of your recklessness.

65
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:27,099
I'm giving you
half of our forces--

66
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:29,436
30,000 men.

67
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,272
You will bring them to
Catelyn Stark's girlhood home

68
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:35,109
and remind her
that Lannisters

69
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:36,977
pay their debts.

70
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:41,282
I didn't realize you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

71
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:43,652
He's a Lannister.

72
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:46,855
He might be the lowest of the
Lannisters, but he's one of us.

73
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,524
And every day
that he remains a prisoner,

74
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,393
the less our name
commands respect.

75
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:55,562
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of--

76
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:57,598
No, it's not an opinion.
It's a fact.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,635
If another House
can seize one of our own

78
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,471
and hold him captive
with impunity,

79
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,673
we are no longer
a House to be feared.

80
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,314
Your mother's dead.

81
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:16,517
Before long I'll be dead.

82
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,385
And you

83
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,688
and your brother
and your sister

84
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,625
and all of her children.
All of us dead;

85
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,528
all of us rotting
in the ground.

86
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:30,031
It's the family name
that lives on.

87
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,568
It's all that lives on.

88
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:36,038
Not your personal glory,
not your honor,

89
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:38,707
but family.

90
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:41,143
Do you understand?

91
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:45,114
Hmm.

92
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,292
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

93
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:59,397
You are blessed to belong to the
most powerful family in the kingdoms.

94
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:02,134
And you are still
blessed with youth.

95
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,605
<i>And what have you done</i>
<i>with these blessings, huh?</i>

96
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,142
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings--

97
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:14,112
<i>one a madman,</i>
<i>the other a drunk.</i>

98
00:07:18,983 --> 00:07:22,719
The future of our family will be
determined in these next few months.

99
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:26,389
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

100
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:30,494
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

101
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:37,234
I need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

102
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,038
Not next year.
Not tomorrow.

103
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:43,207
Now.

104
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:15,170
You're in pain.

105
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:22,145
I've had worse, My Lady.

106
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,549
Perhaps it's time
to go home.

107
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,584
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

108
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:29,987
I know the truth
Jon Arryn died for.

109
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:32,923
Do you, Lord Stark?

110
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,660
Is that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

111
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:40,231
Has he done this before?

112
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,767
Jaime would have killed him.

113
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:46,703
My brother is worth
a thousand of your friend.

114
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:47,971
Your brother...

115
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,840
Or your lover?

116
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:57,647
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

117
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,616
to keep bloodlines pure.

118
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,085
Jaime and I are more
than brother and sister.

119
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,220
We shared a womb.

120
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,323
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

121
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,293
My son saw you with him.

122
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:18,136
Do you love your children?

123
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,171
- With all my heart.
- No more than I love mine.

124
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:23,441
- And they are all Jaime's.
- Thank the Gods.

125
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,644
In the rare event that
Robert leaves his whores

126
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:27,408
for long enough to stumble
drunk into my bed,

127
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,780
I finish him off in other ways.

128
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:31,883
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

129
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:35,186
Hated him?
I worshipped him.

130
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,780
Every girl in the
Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him,

131
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,211
but he was mine by oath.

132
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,392
And when I finally saw him

133
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:43,393
on our wedding day
in the Sept of Baelor,

134
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:46,029
lean and fierce
and black-bearded,

135
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,265
it was the happiest moment
of my life.

136
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:52,336
Then that night he crawled on
top of me, stinking of wine

137
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,139
and did what he did--
what little he could do--

138
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:59,378
and whispered
in my ear, "Lyanna."

139
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:04,049
Your sister was a corpse
and I was a living girl

140
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,552
and he loved her
more than me.

141
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:11,490
When the King returns from his
hunt, I'll tell him the truth.

142
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:14,592
You must be gone by then--
you and your children.

143
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:17,762
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

144
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:19,830
Go as far away
as you can,

145
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:22,466
with as many men
as you can.

146
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,868
Because wherever you go,

147
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:27,270
Robert's wrath
will follow you.

148
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,873
And what of my wrath,
Lord Stark?

149
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:32,509
You should have taken
the realm for yourself.

150
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:35,412
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

151
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:38,348
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

152
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:40,850
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

153
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:43,653
Such a sad mistake.

154
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:46,189
I've made many mistakes
in my life,

155
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:48,925
but that wasn't
one of them.

156
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,593
Oh, but it was.

157
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:54,062
When you play the Game
of Thrones, you win

158
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,364
or you die.

159
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,499
There is no middle ground.

160
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:08,608
Come here.

161
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:36,005
Oh yes, oh.

162
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,142
<i>Oh yes yes yes.</i>

163
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:48,651
No no no no!

164
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:53,022
Is that what they teach you up
in the North?

165
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:57,594
And you--
wherever you're from,

166
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,831
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

167
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:05,136
Either of you understand
a thing that I'm saying?

168
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:08,040
Yes, My Lord.

169
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:10,442
Let's start over,
shall we?

170
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:13,711
You be the man

171
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:15,913
and you be the woman.

172
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:23,119
Well, go ahead.

173
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:26,722
<i>Slowly.</i>

174
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,902
You're not fooling <i>them.</i>
They just paid you.

175
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:40,571
They know what you are.

176
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,741
They know it's all
just an act.

177
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,744
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

178
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,880
That takes time.

179
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,750
You need to...

180
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,818
Ease into it.

181
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:57,890
Go ahead.

182
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,393
<i>Ease into it.</i>

183
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,738
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

184
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:14,274
You're starting
to like this.

185
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:17,444
He wants to believe you.

186
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,913
He's enjoyed his cock since he
was old enough to play with it.

187
00:13:19,948 --> 00:13:24,285
Why shouldn't you?
He knows he's better than other men.

188
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:27,989
He's always known it deep down
inside. Now he has proof.

189
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,825
He's so good,

190
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:33,323
he's reaching something
deep inside of you that

191
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:34,968
no one even knew was there,

192
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:38,266
overcoming
your very nature.

193
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,537
Why don't you join us,
My Lord?

194
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,141
I'm saving myself
for another.

195
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,743
What she doesn't know
won't hurt her.

196
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,912
A stupid saying.

197
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:54,014
What we don't know
is usually what gets us killed.

198
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:57,551
She must be
very beautiful.

199
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:01,389
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

200
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,658
I do believe
My Lord's in love.

201
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,495
For many years.
Most of my life really.

202
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:08,296
Play with her ass.

203
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:10,899
<i>And she loved me too.</i>

204
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,901
I was her little confidant,

205
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,370
her plaything.

206
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:18,240
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

207
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:22,044
She told me about all the
horses that she liked,

208
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,270
the castle she wanted
to live in and the man

209
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:26,715
that she wanted to marry.

210
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,819
A northerner
with a jaw like an anvil.

211
00:14:32,513 --> 00:14:34,354
<i>So I challenged him</i>
<i>to a duel.</i>

212
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:37,059
<i>I mean, why not?</i>
<i>I'd read all the stories.</i>

213
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:40,863
The little hero always beats the
big villain in all the stories.

214
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:45,334
In the end, she wouldn't
even let him kill me.

215
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:48,003
"He's just a boy,"
she said.

216
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:50,973
<i>"Please don't hurt him."</i>

217
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:54,010
So he gave me a nice little
scar to remember him by

218
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:56,679
- and off they went.
- Is she still married to him?

219
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:57,974
Oh no.

220
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,599
He got himself killed
before the wedding...

221
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,669
..And she ended
up with his brother,

222
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:05,622
an even more
impressive specimen.

223
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,224
She loves him,
I'm afraid.

224
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,961
<i>And why wouldn't she?</i>
<i>I mean, who could compare to him?</i>

225
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:14,531
He's just so...

226
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,871
Good.

227
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,942
Do you know what I learned,
losing that duel?

228
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:29,846
I learned that
I'll never win,

229
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,049
not that way.
That's <i>their</i> game,

230
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,852
<i>their</i> rules.

231
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:37,854
I'm not going
to fight them.

232
00:15:37,888 --> 00:15:41,257
<i>I'm going to fuck them.</i>
<i>That's what I know.</i>

233
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:43,526
That's what I am.

234
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:46,396
And only by admitting what we
are can we get what we want.

235
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:49,899
And what do you want?

236
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,468
Oh, everything, my dear.

237
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:55,571
Everything there is.

238
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:01,576
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

239
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:09,583
Hmm.

240
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,078
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

241
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:41,751
<i>Where I come from, we don't</i>
<i>show mercy to criminals.</i>

242
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:44,787
Where I come from, if someone
like you attacked a little lord?

243
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:48,523
At low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

244
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:51,927
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

245
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:54,596
<i>The sea would come in</i>
<i>closer and closer.</i>

246
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,433
You'd see death creeping toward
you a few inches at a time.

247
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,504
Where is it you come from?

248
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,239
<i>The Iron Islands.</i>

249
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,807
They far away?

250
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:08,309
You've never heard
of the Iron Islands?

251
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:12,146
Trust me, you've never heard
where I'm from neither.

252
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:15,648
"Trust me, <i>My Lord."</i>

253
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,586
You're not living
in the wilderness anymore.

254
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,189
<i>In civilized lands,</i>
<i>you refer to your betters</i>

255
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:25,324
<i>by their proper titles.</i>

256
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,026
- And what's that?
- Lord.

257
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,262
Why?

258
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:32,599
Why?

259
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,734
What do you mean why?

260
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:38,071
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

261
00:17:38,105 --> 00:17:39,873
What's that got
to do with you?

262
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,809
<i>If your father's lord,</i>

263
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:44,678
how can you be lord too?

264
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:47,647
I <i>will</i> be lord
after my father--

265
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,382
so you're not lord now?

266
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,417
No, you--

267
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:55,521
You having a go at me?
Is that it?

268
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:59,325
I just don't understand
how you Southerners do things.

269
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,460
- I'm not a Southerner.
- You're from South of the wall.

270
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:05,763
That makes you
a Southerner to me.

271
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:10,735
You're an impudent
little wench, aren't you?

272
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,504
Couldn't say, My Lord.

273
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,574
Don't know what
"impunent" means.

274
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,811
Impudent.
It means rude,

275
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:21,080
<i>disrespectful.</i>

276
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:27,420
Do you want
to lose that chain?

277
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:31,757
Theon Greyjoy!

278
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,226
The lady is our guest.

279
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,227
I thought she was
our prisoner.

280
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:40,064
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

281
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,477
Chances are I won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

282
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:56,447
I'm used to worse than him.

283
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:59,117
I'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

284
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,886
and pick their teeth
with his bones.

285
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:09,395
Why did you come here?

286
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,764
Didn't mean to come here.

287
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:14,466
Meant to get much
further South than this.

288
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,435
As far South
as South goes,

289
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,939
before the long night
comes.

290
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:23,643
Why? What are you
afraid of?

291
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:26,946
There's things that
sleep in the day

292
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:29,948
- and hunt at night.
- Owls and Shadowcats and--

293
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,551
I'm not talking about
Owls and Shadowcats.

294
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:39,490
The "things" you speak of--

295
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,593
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

296
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,762
They wasn't gone, old man.

297
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:48,366
They was sleeping.

298
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,269
And they ain't
sleeping no more.

299
00:20:00,247 --> 00:20:02,816
<i>I miss girls.</i>

300
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,720
Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.

301
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,323
Just looking at them,

302
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:10,991
<i>hearing them giggle.</i>

303
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:18,698
Don't you miss girls?

304
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:24,903
Riders.

305
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:28,473
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

306
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:32,477
Why is he alone?

307
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:35,547
<i>One blast</i>
<i>for a Ranger returning,</i>

308
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,248
<i>two for Wildlings,</i>

309
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:39,317
- <i>three for--</i>
- there's no rider.

310
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,353
<i><i>Whoa, boy, whoa.</i>

311
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,656
That's my
Uncle Benjen's horse.

312
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,834
Where's my Uncle?

313
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:31,938
Ned!

314
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,342
It's Robert.
We were hunting--

315
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:38,879
a boar--

316
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:47,921
I should have
spent more time with you,

317
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:51,425
shown you how to be a man.

318
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:57,432
I was never meant
to be a father.

319
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,623
Go on.

320
00:22:19,657 --> 00:22:21,825
You don't want to see this.

321
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:38,142
My fault.

322
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:41,479
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

323
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:53,759
It stinks.

324
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:56,495
It stinks like death.

325
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:59,197
Don't think
I can't smell it.

326
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:04,568
I paid
the bastard back, Ned.

327
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:07,938
I drove my knife
right through his brain.

328
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:10,641
<i>You ask them if I didn't.</i>
<i>Ask them!</i>

329
00:23:12,243 --> 00:23:14,711
I want the funeral feast
to be the biggest

330
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:16,680
the Kingdoms ever saw.

331
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:21,351
And I want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

332
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,325
Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.

333
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:31,629
- Robert, my sweet--
- Out, all of you!

334
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:54,151
You damned fool.

335
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:56,554
Paper and ink
on the table,

336
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,956
write down what I say.

337
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:10,567
"In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

338
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:13,270
first of--"
you know how it goes.

339
00:24:13,304 --> 00:24:15,806
Fill in the damn titles.

340
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,409
"I hereby command

341
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:21,279
Eddard of House Stark--"

342
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:23,581
titles, titles--

343
00:24:23,615 --> 00:24:27,418
"to serve as Lord Regent
and Protector of the Realm

344
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:29,553
upon my death,

345
00:24:29,587 --> 00:24:32,389
to rule in my stead

346
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:35,292
until my son Joffrey
comes of age."

347
00:24:53,646 --> 00:24:55,313
Give it over.

348
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:13,033
Give it to the council

349
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,768
after I'm dead.

350
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:18,071
At least they'll say
I did this right,

351
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:20,674
<i>this one thing.</i>

352
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:23,310
You'll rule now.

353
00:25:23,345 --> 00:25:26,379
You'll hate it
worse than I did,

354
00:25:26,414 --> 00:25:29,583
but you'll do it well.

355
00:25:32,987 --> 00:25:35,221
The girl--

356
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:37,990
Daenerys.

357
00:25:38,025 --> 00:25:42,228
You were right.
Varys, Littlefinger,

358
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:44,730
my brother...
Worthless.

359
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:49,335
No one to tell me "no"
but you.

360
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:52,038
Only you.

361
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:57,710
Let her live.

362
00:25:57,744 --> 00:26:00,413
Stop it,
if it's not too late.

363
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:02,315
I will.

364
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:04,584
And my son...

365
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:07,219
Help him, Ned.

366
00:26:08,855 --> 00:26:10,656
Make him better than me.

367
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:13,626
I'll...

368
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,329
I'll do everything I can
to honor your memory.

369
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:20,231
My memory.

370
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:25,503
King Robert Baratheon,

371
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,938
murdered by a pig.

372
00:26:31,477 --> 00:26:35,280
Give me something
for the pain and let me die.

373
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:52,198
Give him
milk of the poppy.

374
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:02,041
He was reeling
from the wine.

375
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,979
He commanded us

376
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:08,915
to step aside, but...

377
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,616
I failed him.

378
00:27:12,853 --> 00:27:15,622
No man could have
protected him from himself.

379
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:19,460
I wonder,
Ser Barristan,

380
00:27:19,494 --> 00:27:22,429
who gave the king
this wine?

381
00:27:23,664 --> 00:27:26,499
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

382
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:29,135
His squire?
The Lannister boy?

383
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,772
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure his Grace

384
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,808
did not lack refreshment.

385
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:38,112
I do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

386
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:48,324
His Grace has had
a change of heart

387
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:50,392
concerning
Daenerys Targaryen.

388
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:56,230
Whatever
arrangements you made,

389
00:27:56,264 --> 00:27:58,599
unmake them.
At once.

390
00:27:58,633 --> 00:28:01,201
I'm afraid

391
00:28:01,236 --> 00:28:02,903
those birds have flown.

392
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:05,339
The girl is likely
dead already.

393
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,228
...Throne.

394
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:04,464
Throne.

395
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,276
Can't you help me
make him understand?

396
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,246
The Dothraki do things in their
own time, for their own reasons.

397
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,515
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, I promise you.

398
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,918
My brother was
a fool, I know,

399
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:59,754
but he was the rightful heir
to the Seven Kingdoms.

400
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:03,224
Have I said
something funny, Ser?

401
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:06,160
Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your
ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

402
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,996
didn't seize six of the kingdoms
because they were his right.

403
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:11,766
He had no right to them. He
seized them because he could.

404
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,267
And because
he had dragons.

405
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:16,037
Ah well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.

406
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,609
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

407
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:23,546
I believe what my eyes
and ears report.

408
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,783
As for the rest...
It was 300 years ago.

409
00:30:26,817 --> 00:30:28,585
Who knows
what really happened?

410
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:31,287
Now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek
out the merchant Captain,

411
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:32,822
see if he has
any letters for me.

412
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:35,324
- I'll come with you.
- No no, don't trouble yourself.

413
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:38,694
Enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.

414
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:49,604
Psst, Jorah the Andal.

415
00:30:51,674 --> 00:30:53,876
The spider sends
his greetings

416
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,111
and his congratulations.

417
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,050
A royal pardon--
you can go home now.

418
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:15,232
Virzetha gizikhven!
Mra qora! Mra qora!

419
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:44,926
My son already has his name,
but I'll try your summerwine.

420
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:46,127
Just a taste.

421
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:49,331
My Lady, you are
from Westeros.

422
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:53,236
You have the honor of addressing
Daenerys of the House Targaryen,

423
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:57,641
Khaleesi of the riding men
and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

424
00:31:57,675 --> 00:31:59,810
- Princess.
- <i>Rise.</i>

425
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:01,779
I'd still like
to taste that wine.

426
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:05,283
That? Dornish swill.

427
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:07,819
<i>Not worthy</i>
<i>of a princess.</i>

428
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:10,088
I have a dry red
from the Arbor--

429
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:12,057
nectar of the Gods.

430
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:14,926
Let me give you a cask.
Uh-- a gift.

431
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:16,461
You honor me, Ser.

432
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:19,131
The honor--
the honor is all mine.

433
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:21,066
Huh-uh, huh-uh.

434
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,739
There are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, princess.

435
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:29,574
I hope to repay
your kindness someday.

436
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:31,243
- Rakharo.
- Huh.

437
00:32:35,282 --> 00:32:37,651
- Is something wrong?
- I have a thirst.

438
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:39,519
Open it.

439
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:42,222
The wine is for the Khaleesi.
It's not for the likes of you.

440
00:32:42,257 --> 00:32:43,590
Open it.

441
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:56,770
Pour.

442
00:32:56,804 --> 00:32:58,872
It would be a crime
to drink a wine this rich

443
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:00,527
without at least
giving it time to breathe.

444
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:02,581
Do as he says.

445
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:04,745
As the princess commands.

446
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:19,093
<i>Sweet, isn't it?</i>

447
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:21,496
<i>Can you smell</i>
<i>the fruit, Ser?</i>

448
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:24,566
Taste it, My Lord.

449
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,434
Tell me that that
is not the finest wine

450
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:28,670
<i>that has ever touched</i>
<i>your tongue.</i>

451
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:34,076
You first.

452
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:37,445
Me?

453
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,881
I'm afraid I am not
worthy of the vintage.

454
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:41,750
Besides, it is a poor
wine merchant who would

455
00:33:41,775 --> 00:33:42,919
drink up his own wares.

456
00:33:42,944 --> 00:33:44,993
You will drink.

457
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:03,937
- Khaleesi!
- Stop him!

458
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,050
Come.

459
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:28,725
You came to us
as outlaws,

460
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,229
poachers, rapers,

461
00:34:32,264 --> 00:34:34,665
killers, thieves.

462
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,501
<i>You came alone,</i>
<i>in chains,</i>

463
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:40,104
<i>without friends</i>

464
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,307
<i>nor honor.</i>

465
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:45,744
<i>You came to us rich</i>
<i>and you came to us poor.</i>

466
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:50,190
Some of you bear the names
of proud houses,

467
00:34:50,384 --> 00:34:53,952
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

468
00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:56,021
It does not matter.

469
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:59,190
All that is in the past.

470
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,692
Here,

471
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,294
on the wall,

472
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:06,430
are all one house.

473
00:35:07,865 --> 00:35:11,201
- <i>Tonight...</i>
- You're allowed to look happy.

474
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,337
You're going
to be a Ranger.

475
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:17,374
Isn't that what you
always wanted?

476
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:19,811
I want
to find my Uncle.

477
00:35:19,845 --> 00:35:22,647
I know he's alive
out there.

478
00:35:22,682 --> 00:35:24,249
I know he is.

479
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:28,454
I wish I could help you,
but I'm no Ranger.

480
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:31,357
It's the steward's life
for me.

481
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:34,427
There's honor
in being a steward.

482
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:36,829
Not much, really.

483
00:35:36,864 --> 00:35:38,664
But there's food.

484
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:45,305
Here you begin anew.

485
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:56,482
A man
of The Night's Watch...

486
00:35:58,018 --> 00:36:01,020
Lives his life
for the realm.

487
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:04,390
Not for a king,

488
00:36:04,424 --> 00:36:07,627
or a lord, or the honor
of this house

489
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:10,096
<i>or that house;</i>

490
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,865
not for gold nor glory

491
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,667
nor a woman's love;

492
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:17,169
but for the realm

493
00:36:17,203 --> 00:36:19,971
<i>and all the people in it.</i>

494
00:36:20,006 --> 00:36:23,508
You've all learned
the words of the vow.

495
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:27,245
Think carefully
before you say them.

496
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:30,648
<i>The penalty for desertion</i>

497
00:36:30,683 --> 00:36:33,485
is death.

498
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,858
You can take
your vows here

499
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:43,729
tonight at sunset.

500
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:46,465
Do any of you
still keep the old Gods?

501
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:50,503
I do, My Lord.

502
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:53,806
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your Uncle did.

503
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:55,318
Yes, My Lord.

504
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:57,735
You'll find a Weirwood
a mile North of the Wall.

505
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:01,181
And your old Gods too, maybe.

506
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,219
My Lord,
might I go as well?

507
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:07,221
Does house Tarly
keep the old Gods?

508
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:10,190
No, My Lord.

509
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:12,292
I was named in the light
of the Seven,

510
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,861
as my father was
and his father before him.

511
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:19,000
Why would you forsake the Gods
of your father and your house?

512
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,171
The Night's Watch
is my house now.

513
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:25,740
The Seven have never
answered my prayers.

514
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,410
Perhaps the old Gods will.

515
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:31,846
As you wish, lad.

516
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:35,483
<i>You've all been</i>
<i>assigned an order,</i>

517
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:38,920
<i>according to our needs</i>

518
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,622
and your strengths.

519
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:43,758
Halder to the builders.

520
00:37:44,627 --> 00:37:46,495
<i>Pyp to the stewards.</i>

521
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:49,364
<i>Toad to the builders.</i>
<i>Grenn to the Rangers.</i>

522
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:51,432
<i>Samwell to the stewards.</i>

523
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:54,736
Matthar to the Rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

524
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,805
Balian to the Rangers.

525
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:58,706
Rast to the Rangers.

526
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:00,508
<i>Jon to the stewards.</i>

527
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,376
<i>Rancer to the builders.</i>

528
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:04,078
<i>Echiel to the builders.</i>

529
00:38:04,113 --> 00:38:05,313
<i>Gordo to the stewards.</i>

530
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:09,184
<i>Niko to the Rangers.</i>
<i>Escan to the Rangers.</i>

531
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,854
<i>Vorkoy to the builders.</i>
<i>Joby to the stables.</i>

532
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:15,291
<i>Mink to the kitchens.</i>
<i>Allo to the builders.</i>

533
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,661
<i>Nelugo to the Rangers.</i>

534
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:21,398
May all the Gods
preserve you.

535
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:28,838
Rangers with me.

536
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,240
<i>Builders!</i>

537
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:54,799
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

538
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,903
Pyp, you will report to
Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

539
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:03,674
Luke, report to one-eyed Joe
in the stables.

540
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:07,378
Dareon, we are sending
you to Eastwatch.

541
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:10,515
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

542
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:13,852
Make no comment
about his nose.

543
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:18,323
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

544
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:21,025
has requested you
for his personal steward.

545
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,228
Will I serve
the Lord Commander's meals

546
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,229
and fetch hot water
for his bath.

547
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,480
Certainly.

548
00:39:27,505 --> 00:39:29,365
And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

549
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,636
change his sheets
and blankets daily

550
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:36,506
and do everything else the
Lord Commander requires of you.

551
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,045
Do you take me
for a servant?

552
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,614
We took you for a man
of The Night's Watch.

553
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:46,617
<i>But perhaps we</i>
<i>were wrong in that.</i>

554
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,353
- May I go?
- As you wish.

555
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,027
Jon, wait!

556
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,996
Don't you see
what they're doing?

557
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,031
I see Ser Alliser's revenge,
that's all.

558
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:03,966
He wanted it
and he got it.

559
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,468
Stewards are nothing
but maids!

560
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:08,636
I'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

561
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:12,407
- It's not fair.
- <i>Fair?</i>

562
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:14,910
I was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

563
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:17,880
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

564
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:20,341
I pushed him away and he said
he'd have my hands cut off

565
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:21,804
for stealing their silver.

566
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:23,638
So now I'm here--
at the end of the world

567
00:40:23,663 --> 00:40:24,688
with no one to sing for

568
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,590
<i>but old men</i>
<i>and little shits like you.</i>

569
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,626
I'll never see
my family again.

570
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,694
I'll never be inside
a woman again.

571
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,240
So don't tell me about fair.

572
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:34,165
I thought you were caught
stealing a wheel of cheese

573
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,266
for your starving sister?

574
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:37,661
You think I was gonna tell
a bunch of strangers

575
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,302
that a high lord tried
to grab my cock?

576
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:46,374
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.

577
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,214
Now listen to me.

578
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,184
The old man is the Lord Commander
of The Night's Watch.

579
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:58,453
You'll be with him
day and night.

580
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,955
Yes, you'll
clean his clothes.

581
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:05,159
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

582
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:06,894
squire for him in battle.

583
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:10,264
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

584
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:12,433
And he asked for you himself.

585
00:41:13,535 --> 00:41:16,303
He wants to groom you
for command.

586
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:23,742
I just...

587
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:26,044
I always wanted
to be a Ranger.

588
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:30,315
I always wanted
to be a Wizard.

589
00:41:32,852 --> 00:41:34,553
What?

590
00:41:34,587 --> 00:41:37,223
No, I'm serious.

591
00:41:37,257 --> 00:41:39,693
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

592
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:49,604
Lord Stark, a moment.

593
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,807
Alone if you will.

594
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:05,221
He named you
Protector of the Realm.

595
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:07,490
He did.

596
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:09,291
She won't care.

597
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:12,661
Give me an hour and I can put a
hundred swords at your command.

598
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,697
And what should I do
with a hundred swords?

599
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:18,134
Strike! Tonight
while the castle sleeps.

600
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:22,172
We must get Joffrey away fro
his mother and into our custody.

601
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:26,644
<i>Protector of the Realm or no,</i>
<i>he who holds the King holds the Kingdom.</i>

602
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:30,315
<i>Every moment you delay gives</i>
<i>Cersei another moment to prepare.</i>

603
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:33,484
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

604
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,252
<i>What about Stannis?</i>

605
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,488
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from
Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?

606
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:41,324
<i>You have odd notions about</i>
<i>protecting the realm.</i>

607
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,410
Stannis is your older brother.

608
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,264
<i>This isn't about the bloody</i>
<i>line of succession.</i>

609
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:48,230
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King.

610
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,599
It shouldn't matter now.

611
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,636
<i>What's best</i>
<i>for the Kingdoms?</i>

612
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:56,706
What's best
for the people we rule?

613
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:00,310
We all know
what Stannis is.

614
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:03,313
He inspires
no love or loyalty.

615
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,449
He's not a King.

616
00:43:05,484 --> 00:43:08,252
I am.

617
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,760
Stannis is a commander.

618
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:19,664
He's led men
into war twice.

619
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,966
He destroyed
the Greyjoy fleet--

620
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:23,764
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that.

621
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:25,376
So was Robert.

622
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,173
Tell me something:

623
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:29,808
Do you still believe
good soldiers make good kings?

624
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:37,783
I will not dishonor
Robert's last hours

625
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:39,685
by shedding blood
in his halls

626
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:42,822
and dragging frightened
children from their beds.

627
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,072
You will sail
to dragonstone tonight.

628
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:01,875
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

629
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:05,478
Not his steward,

630
00:44:05,513 --> 00:44:08,615
not his Captain
of the guard,

631
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,184
and not his wife.

632
00:44:16,057 --> 00:44:17,624
Only Stannis himself.

633
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:20,894
Yes, My Lord.

634
00:44:23,064 --> 00:44:24,565
Now leave us.

635
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:36,578
My Lord protector.

636
00:44:41,185 --> 00:44:43,854
The King has
no trueborn sons.

637
00:44:43,888 --> 00:44:46,490
<i>Joffrey and Tommen</i>

638
00:44:46,524 --> 00:44:48,525
are Jaime Lannister's
bastards.

639
00:44:49,994 --> 00:44:53,096
- So when the King dies--
- The throne passes

640
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,332
to his brother
Lord Stannis.

641
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:59,302
So it would seem.

642
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:03,339
- Unless--
- there is no "unless."

643
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:05,841
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

644
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,010
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

645
00:45:08,044 --> 00:45:09,444
You would be wise
to deny it to him

646
00:45:09,478 --> 00:45:12,180
<i>and to make sure</i>
<i>Joffrey succeeds.</i>

647
00:45:15,051 --> 00:45:17,820
Do you have
a shred of honor?

648
00:45:17,854 --> 00:45:21,725
You are now Hand of the King
<i>and</i> Protector of the Realm.

649
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:24,061
All of the power is yours.
You need only

650
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,597
reach out and take it.

651
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:28,832
<i>Make peace</i>
<i>with the Lannisters.</i>

652
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:32,237
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

653
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,172
<i>We have plenty of time</i>
<i>to get rid of Stannis.</i>

654
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:37,661
And if Joffrey seems likely
to cause problems when he

655
00:45:37,686 --> 00:45:38,986
comes into his throne,

656
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:41,412
we simply reveal
his little secret

657
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,381
and seat Lord Renly
there instead.

658
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:44,547
We?

659
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:46,283
You'll need someone
to share these burdens.

660
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,388
I assure you--
my price would be modest.

661
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:53,591
What you suggest is treason.

662
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,859
Only if we lose.

663
00:45:58,229 --> 00:46:00,864
Make peace with
the Lannisters, you say...

664
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:04,733
With the people
who tried to murder my boy.

665
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:07,169
We only make peace
with our enemies, My Lord.

666
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:10,605
That's why it's
called "making peace."

667
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,909
No.
I won't do it.

668
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:16,611
So it will be Stannis
and war?

669
00:46:16,645 --> 00:46:18,846
There is no other choice.

670
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:21,449
He is the heir.

671
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:24,019
So why did you
call me here?

672
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:26,688
Not for my wisdom,
clearly.

673
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,892
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

674
00:46:29,926 --> 00:46:32,629
The Queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms--

675
00:46:32,663 --> 00:46:36,032
enough to overwhelm what
remains of <i>my</i> household guard.

676
00:46:36,067 --> 00:46:38,535
I need the gold cloaks.

677
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,772
The City Watch
is 2,000 strong

678
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:45,243
and sworn to defend
the King's peace.

679
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:50,449
Look at you.

680
00:46:50,484 --> 00:46:52,818
You know what
you want me to do,

681
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:54,954
you know it has
to be done,

682
00:46:54,988 --> 00:46:59,558
but it's not honorable
so the words stick in your throat.

683
00:46:59,592 --> 00:47:02,894
When the Queen
proclaims one King

684
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:04,563
and the Hand
proclaims another,

685
00:47:04,597 --> 00:47:08,166
whose peace do
the Gold Cloaks protect?

686
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,302
Who do they follow?

687
00:47:15,975 --> 00:47:18,843
The man who pays them.

688
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:07,362
Hear my words and bear
witness to my vow.

689
00:48:07,396 --> 00:48:11,132
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

690
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:14,636
<i>It shall not end</i>
<i>until my death.</i>

691
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,838
<i>I shall take no wife,</i>

692
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:19,808
<i>hold no lands,</i>
<i>father no children.</i>

693
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:24,212
<i>I shall wear no crowns</i>
<i>and win no glory.</i>

694
00:48:24,247 --> 00:48:27,982
I shall live and die
at my post.

695
00:48:28,017 --> 00:48:31,118
I am the sword
in the darkness.

696
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:33,988
I am the watcher
on the walls.

697
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:37,324
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

698
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:41,761
I pledge my li and honor
to The Night's Watch,

699
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:45,731
for this night and all
the nights to come.

700
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:47,766
You knelt as boys.

701
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,569
Rise now as men
of The Night's Watch.

702
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:05,786
Well done.
Well done.

703
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:14,395
What's he got there?

704
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:17,598
To me, ghost.
Bring it here.

705
00:49:19,701 --> 00:49:22,101
Gods be good!

706
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:31,210
What will they
do to him?

707
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,515
When the Khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle,

708
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:39,318
forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

709
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:41,053
And when he falls?

710
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,991
I saw a man
last nine miles once.

711
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:49,795
King Robert
still wants me dead.

712
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:52,131
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

713
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:55,034
I thought
he'd leave me alone--

714
00:49:55,069 --> 00:49:56,736
now that my brother
is gone.

715
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:58,772
He will never
leave you alone.

716
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:02,476
<i>If you ride to darkest Asshai,</i>
<i>his assassins will follow you.</i>

717
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,879
<i>If you sailed all the way</i>
<i>to the Basilisk Isles,</i>

718
00:50:04,913 --> 00:50:06,480
<i>his spies would tell him.</i>

719
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:09,284
He will never
abandon the hunt.

720
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:13,254
<i>You're a Targaryen--</i>
<i>the last Targaryen.</i>

721
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:15,523
<i>Your son will have</i>
<i>Targaryen blood</i>

722
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:18,225
with 40,000 riders
behind him.

723
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:21,594
He will not have my son.

724
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,597
He will not have
you either, Khaleesi.

725
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:28,409
Lord Stark!

726
00:53:28,443 --> 00:53:30,912
- Stop!
- Ned: No, all right.

727
00:53:30,946 --> 00:53:32,880
It's all right.
Let him through.

728
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:35,249
Lord Stark, King Joffrey
and the Queen Regent

729
00:53:35,283 --> 00:53:36,801
request your presence
in the Throne Room.

730
00:53:36,826 --> 00:53:38,119
King Joffrey?

731
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,388
King Robert is gone.

732
00:53:40,422 --> 00:53:42,423
The Gods give him rest.

733
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:56,504
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

734
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:58,206
Good.

735
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:00,309
Is Lord Renly joining us?

736
00:54:02,545 --> 00:54:05,381
I fear Lord Renly
has left the city.

737
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:08,350
<i>He rode through</i>
<i>the old gate</i>

738
00:54:08,384 --> 00:54:09,618
<i>an hour before dawn</i>

739
00:54:09,653 --> 00:54:13,289
with Ser Loras Tyrell
and some 50 retainers.

740
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:17,260
Last seen galloping South
in some haste.

741
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:40,116
We stand behind you,
Lord Stark.

742
00:54:49,493 --> 00:54:51,561
All hail his Grace,

743
00:54:51,596 --> 00:54:54,464
Joffrey of Houses
Baratheon and Lannister,

744
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:56,066
the first of his name,

745
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,535
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

746
00:54:58,569 --> 00:55:00,737
<i>Lord of the Seven Kingdoms</i>

747
00:55:00,771 --> 00:55:03,974
and Protector of the Realm.

748
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,214
I command the council to make
all necessary arrangements

749
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,692
for my coronation.

750
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:28,134
I wish to be crowned
within the fortnight.

751
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:30,970
Today I shall accept
oaths of fealty

752
00:55:31,004 --> 00:55:33,372
from my loyal councilors.

753
00:55:37,077 --> 00:55:39,211
Ser Barristan,

754
00:55:39,245 --> 00:55:42,313
I believe no man here
could ever question your honor.

755
00:55:53,158 --> 00:55:57,027
King Robert's seal--
unbroken.

756
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:07,005
"Lord Eddard Stark
is herein named

757
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,076
Protector of the Realm,

758
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,511
to rule as Regent

759
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:15,715
until the heir
come of age."

760
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:19,118
May I see that letter,
Ser Barristan?

761
00:56:27,561 --> 00:56:30,329
Protector of the realm.

762
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:35,802
Is this meant
to be your shield, Lord Stark?

763
00:56:37,171 --> 00:56:39,105
A piece of paper?

764
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:45,278
- Those were the King's words.
- We have a new King now.

765
00:56:48,316 --> 00:56:51,018
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you offered me some counsel.

766
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:54,589
<i>Allow me to return</i>
<i>the courtesy.</i>

767
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:56,825
Bend the knee, My Lord.

768
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:59,395
Bend the knee and swear
loyalty to my son--

769
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:03,099
and we shall allow you
to live out your days

770
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:05,502
<i>in the gray waste</i>
<i>you call home.</i>

771
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:08,271
Your son has no claim
to the throne.

772
00:57:08,306 --> 00:57:10,040
Liar!

773
00:57:10,074 --> 00:57:12,609
You condemn yourself with
your own mouth, Lord Stark.

774
00:57:12,644 --> 00:57:14,678
Ser Barristan,
seize this traitor.

775
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:19,417
Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man.
Do him no harm.

776
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,421
You think
he stands alone?

777
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:29,728
Kill him!
Kill all of them, I command it!

778
00:57:29,762 --> 00:57:31,763
Commander,

779
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:34,266
take the Queen and her
children into custody.

780
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,469
<i>Escort them back</i>
<i>to the royal apartments</i>

781
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:38,137
and keep them there,
under guard.

782
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:40,106
Men of the Watch!

783
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:46,412
I want no bloodshed.

784
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:49,314
Tell your men
to lay down their swords.

785
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:51,316
No one needs to die.

786
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:56,388
<i>Now!</i>

787
00:58:05,564 --> 00:58:08,333
I did warn you
not to trust me.
