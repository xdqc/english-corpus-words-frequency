4
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,625
Yah!
Left high, left low.

5
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,279
Right low, lunge right.

6
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,150
You break anything,
the Septa will have my head.

7
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:25,985
What is--

8
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:39,830
Your sister knew perfectly
well we were to leave today.

9
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:42,032
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.

10
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,768
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

11
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:47,338
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

12
00:02:47,372 --> 00:02:49,273
<i>Hush!</i>

13
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:51,509
Go back to your room.

14
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:53,846
Bar the doors

15
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,081
and do not open them for anyone
you do not know.

16
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:58,784
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

17
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,620
Run!

18
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,025
<i>Man: This way!</i>

19
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:21,705
Left, right.
Rah!

20
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,440
Now you are dead.

21
00:03:23,474 --> 00:03:25,442
You said right,

22
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,344
but you went left.

23
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:29,579
And now you are a dead girl.

24
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,214
Only 'cause you lied.

25
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:33,883
My tongue lied.
My eyes

26
00:03:33,917 --> 00:03:37,120
shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.

27
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:39,656
I was so.
I watched, but you--

28
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,160
Watching is not seeing,
dead girl.

29
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,866
The seeing, the true seeing,

30
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,336
that is the heart of swordplay.

31
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,344
Arya Stark, come with us.

32
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:01,114
Your father wants to see you.

33
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:03,516
And why is it

34
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,985
that Lord Eddard is
sending Lannister men

35
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,221
in place of his own?
I am wondering.

36
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:11,324
Mind your place,
dancing master.

37
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:13,893
<i>This is no concern of yours.</i>

38
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:15,762
My father wouldn't send you.

39
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,001
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

40
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:24,370
Take her.

41
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:28,374
Are you men or snakes, that you
would threaten a child?

42
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:30,543
Get out of my way, little man.

43
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:34,046
<i>I am Syrio Forel...</i>

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,081
Foreign bastard.

45
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:42,521
...And you will be speaking
to me with more respect.

46
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:45,157
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.

47
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,429
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

48
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:52,098
Run to your father.

49
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:15,322
Bloody oafs.

50
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,224
Be gone now, Arya.

51
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,828
Come with me.
Run.

52
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:24,466
The First Sword of Braavos
does not run.

53
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:38,513
What do we say

54
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,482
to the God of Death?

55
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,384
Not today.

56
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,353
Go.

57
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,013
Not today.
Not today.

58
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,358
Stay away from me.

59
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:26,059
I'll tell my father.

60
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,062
I'll-- I'll tell the Queen.

61
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:32,799
Who do you think sent me?

62
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,180
Needle.

63
00:06:50,418 --> 00:06:52,452
There she is.

64
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,754
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

65
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,490
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

66
00:06:56,524 --> 00:06:58,591
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.

67
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,193
<i>She'll reward me--
the Queen!</i>

68
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,395
- Stay away!

69
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,129
Lord Stark,
you must be thirsty.

70
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,733
Varys.

71
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:42,837
I promise you
it isn't poisoned.

72
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,809
Why is it no one ever
trusts the eunuch?

73
00:07:55,352 --> 00:07:57,120
Not so much, My Lord.

74
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:59,189
I would save the rest,
if I were you.

75
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:03,093
Hide it. Men have been known to die
of thirst in these cells.

76
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:07,465
What about my daughters?

77
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:10,034
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

78
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,270
Even my little birds
cannot find her.

79
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:15,840
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

80
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:19,444
Cersei will keep her close. The rest
of your household though--

81
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:21,646
all dead, it grieves me to say.

82
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,948
I do so hate
the sight of blood.

83
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,319
You watched my men being
slaughtered and did nothing.

84
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:30,655
And would again, My Lord.

85
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:35,092
I was unarmed, unarmored and
surrounded by Lannister swords.

86
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:37,461
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

87
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,769
What madness led you
to tell the Queen

88
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:48,606
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

89
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:52,943
The madness of mercy.

90
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:57,381
That she might
save her children.

91
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,249
<i>Ah, the children.</i>

92
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:02,153
It is always
the innocents who suffer.

93
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:05,088
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
nor the boar.

94
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:08,592
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

95
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,861
but it was your mercy
that killed the King.

96
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:18,801
I trust you know you are
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

97
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:26,107
The Queen can't kill me.

98
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:28,610
Cat holds her brother.

99
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:31,346
The wrong brother sadly.

100
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:33,115
And lost to her.

101
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,084
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

102
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:42,358
If that's true,

103
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:45,928
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

104
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,531
Not today, My Lord.

105
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:54,404
Tell me something, Varys.

106
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,941
Who do you truly serve?

107
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,845
The Realm, My Lord.

108
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,147
Someone must.

109
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,868
It's Othor, without a doubt.

110
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:27,804
The other one is
Jafer Flowers, My Lord,

111
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,607
<i>less the hand
the wolf tore off.</i>

112
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,644
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

113
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,547
Just these two, My Lord.

114
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,583
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

115
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,353
- Mmm.
- The smell.

116
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,359
What smell?

117
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:49,429
There is none.

118
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:53,199
If they'd be dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

119
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,935
We should burn them.

120
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:59,005
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.

121
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,207
The wildling way.

122
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:03,977
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

123
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,180
You may be a coward, Tarly,

124
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:09,349
<i>but you're not stupid.</i>

125
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:13,419
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

126
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:16,923
Lord Commander,

127
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:19,459
Maester Aemon awaits you
in his chambers--

128
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:23,329
A raven from King's Landing.

129
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:25,231
Come on, move 'em out.

130
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:39,809
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

131
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:42,779
<i>and pour one for yourself.</i>

132
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,158
The King is dead.

133
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,804
Is there any word of my father?

134
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:12,073
Sit.

135
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:19,112
Lord Stark has been

136
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:21,748
charged with treason.

137
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,184
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

138
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:26,954
to deny the throne
to Prince Joffrey.

139
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:42,940
<i>I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.</i>

140
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:46,410
Your duty lies here now.

141
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:49,513
My sisters were
in King's Landing too.

142
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,951
I'm sure they'll be

143
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:55,786
treated gently.

144
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:02,059
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

145
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,563
King Robert's body
was still warm

146
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:09,867
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

147
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:12,270
He wouldn't do that.

148
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:15,173
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

149
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,310
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

150
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:21,981
Send for my father. He'll tell you--
the King was his friend.

151
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:25,084
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
any wrong. We know that.

152
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:28,620
<i>Yet you are the daughter
of a traitor.</i>

153
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,822
How can I allow you
to marry my son?

154
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:34,025
<i>Pycelle: A child born
of a traitor's seed</i>

155
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,393
is no fit consort for our King.

156
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:39,062
<i>She is a sweet thing now,
Your Grace,</i>

157
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:41,564
but in 10 years who knows

158
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:43,566
what treasons she may hatch?

159
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,669
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife
to him, you'll see.

160
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:51,274
I'll be a Queen just like you,
I promise. I won't hatch anything.

161
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:55,278
The girl is innocent,
Your Grace.

162
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:59,115
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

163
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:08,325
Little dove, you must
write to Lady Catelyn

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,694
and your brother,
the eldest, what's his name?

165
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:12,463
Robb.

166
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:15,266
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

167
00:14:15,301 --> 00:14:17,702
Best it comes from you.

168
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:20,105
If you would help your father,

169
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:22,575
urge your brother
to keep the King's peace.

170
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:26,512
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

171
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:36,154
If-- if I could see my father,
talk to him about--

172
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:42,126
You disappoint me, child.

173
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,461
We have told you
of your father's treason.

174
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,663
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

175
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:48,965
I only meant that--

176
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:53,003
What will happen to him?

177
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:58,407
- That depends.
- On-- on what?

178
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:00,309
On your brother.

179
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:05,681
And on you.

180
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:16,193
Treason?

181
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:18,362
Sansa wrote this?

182
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:20,765
It is your sister's hand,
but the Queen's words.

183
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,902
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

184
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:28,039
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

185
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:31,576
This is a royal
command, My Lord.

186
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,079
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.

187
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:37,882
His Grace summons me
to King's Landing,

188
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,351
I'll go to King's Landing.

189
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:43,120
But not alone.

190
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:46,957
Call the banners.

191
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,326
All of them, My Lord?

192
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,232
They've all sworn to defend
my father, have they not?

193
00:15:52,257 --> 00:15:53,457
They have.

194
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:56,633
Now we see what
their words are worth.

195
00:15:58,736 --> 00:15:59,903
Yeah.

196
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:10,547
Are you afraid?

197
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:15,085
I must be.

198
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,288
Good.

199
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,356
Why is that good?

200
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:21,692
It means you're not stupid.

201
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,984
You've had this since dawn?

202
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:50,587
He sent it to me, not you.

203
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:53,056
I've only shown it
to you as a courtesy.

204
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,958
A courtesy?!

205
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,994
My husband has been
taken prisoner.

206
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:58,662
My son intends to declare war.

207
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:00,564
A war?

208
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,000
Your son against
the Lannisters?

209
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:07,404
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

210
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:10,607
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

211
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:13,344
He is your brother by law!

212
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:16,247
Does family mean
nothing to you?

213
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:19,150
Family means everything to me.

214
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:21,619
And I will not
risk Robin's life

215
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:24,122
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

216
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:27,058
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

217
00:17:27,092 --> 00:17:29,293
You just ate.

218
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:32,163
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?

219
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:36,033
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

220
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,371
You're always
welcome here, sister.

221
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:43,407
But if you're asking me to send men
from the Vale to fight--

222
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,643
That is what I ask.

223
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:50,481
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.

224
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:53,117
I'll feed you after.

225
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,792
If you fear for the safety
of your son--

226
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:03,494
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

227
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:06,030
Are you an idiot?

228
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:08,466
They killed my husband.

229
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,935
<i>You say they shoved
your boy from a window.</i>

230
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,504
These people will do anything.

231
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:15,605
And that is why
we have to stop them.

232
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,178
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

233
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:25,948
where they belong,
to protect their Lord.

234
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:42,767
Will you shut up?

235
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,905
There's hill tribes
all around here.

236
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,408
If I'm going to die,

237
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,777
it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

238
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:55,048
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

239
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,351
Eh? What would
you do then?

240
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:01,221
Starve, most likely.

241
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,089
You don't think
I'd do it, do you?

242
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:07,627
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

243
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:10,564
Golden women?

244
00:19:10,598 --> 00:19:12,800
Stick with me
and you'll have them all,

245
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:15,668
for as long as I'm around
and not for a moment longer.

246
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:18,971
But you knew that.

247
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:22,574
That is why you so valiantly took
up arms to defend my honor.

248
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,779
Fair enough.

249
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:29,349
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

250
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:31,952
and "My Lord" you
every time you take a shit.

251
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:35,255
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

252
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:38,493
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

253
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:41,129
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

254
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:44,567
And if the day ever comes when
you're tempted to sell me out,

255
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,335
remember this:

256
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,238
Whatever their price,
I'll beat it.

257
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,373
I like living.

258
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:59,815
Tyrion.

259
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:02,651
Tyrion.

260
00:20:06,823 --> 00:20:08,691
Tyrion.

261
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:33,083
Come, share our fire.

262
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:35,885
Help yourselves to our goat.

263
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:45,160
When you meet your Gods,
you tell them

264
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:47,129
Shagga Son of Dolf

265
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,532
of the Stone Crows sent you.

266
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:53,970
I am Tyrion son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

267
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:57,039
How would you like to die,
Tyrion son of Tywin?

268
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:01,210
In my own bed, at the age of 80

269
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:04,112
with a bellyful of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

270
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,521
Take the half man.

271
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:15,323
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

272
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,459
No no no no no!

273
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:20,562
My-- my House is rich
and powerful.

274
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:23,264
If you see us
through these mountains,

275
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:25,267
my father will
shower you with gold.

276
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,336
We have no use
for a half man's promises.

277
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,941
Half a man maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

278
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:33,576
What do the Stone Crows do?

279
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,845
Hide behind rocks and shiver

280
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,848
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

281
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,517
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

282
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,754
Good enough for killing sheep,

283
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,522
if the sheep don't fight back.

284
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,758
Lannister smiths
shit better steel.

285
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,833
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

286
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:12,115
That trinket is worth more than
everything your tribe owns.

287
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,389
But if you help us,
Shagga Son of Dolf,

288
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:20,092
I will not give you trinkets.

289
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,595
I will give you this.

290
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:25,098
What is "this"?

291
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,801
The Vale of Arryn.

292
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:32,138
The Lords of the Vale have always
spat upon the hill tribes.

293
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:36,376
The Lords of the Vale
want me dead.

294
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:41,180
I believe it is time
for new Lords of the Vale.

295
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:50,922
<i>Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight--</i>

296
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:54,459
not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

297
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:08,206
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

298
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:13,544
Blood will always tell.

299
00:23:13,578 --> 00:23:16,715
You'll hang for this, bastard.

300
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:39,235
I told you not to do
anything stupid.

301
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,905
You're confined
to quarters. Go.

302
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,600
Ghost, what's wrong?

303
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:12,838
Is something out there?

304
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,971
Commander?

305
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:53,011
Stay.

306
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:06,559
Hello?

307
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:16,503
Who's there?

308
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:26,246
Lord Commander?

309
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:54,576
<i>Mormont: Snow?</i>

310
00:25:54,611 --> 00:25:56,211
Commander!

311
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:12,126
Move move!

312
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,214
What did they do?

313
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,669
Daenerys: I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

314
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:56,606
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

315
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,476
ships to sail to Westeros.

316
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,727
Jorah, make them stop.

317
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,995
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

318
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,532
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

319
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:36,747
Princess, you have
a gentle heart,

320
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,783
<i>but this is how
it's always been.</i>

321
00:27:38,817 --> 00:27:41,786
I do not have a gentle heart, Ser.

322
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:56,700
<i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!</i>

323
00:27:56,734 --> 00:28:00,870
<i>- Come.
- Man: Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!</i>

324
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:07,977
What do you want
done with them?

325
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:10,579
Bring her to me.
And those women there.

326
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,883
You cannot claim
them all, Princess.

327
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,952
I can,

328
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,688
and I will.

329
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,690
Man: Me fati!

330
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:25,194
Khaleesi vazha
anhaan qorasokh anni,

331
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:27,563
ch'anha afichak
mae m'arakhoon anni!

332
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,433
Drogo: Me vastoe hatif anni;

333
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,169
<i>ahhazaan yer nemo vacchaki.</i>

334
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:02,124
<i>Ohos.</i>

335
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,293
<i>Ohos.</i>

336
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,045
Thank you, silver lady.

337
00:31:37,282 --> 00:31:39,749
Who are you?

338
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:42,719
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.

339
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:47,124
My mother was godswife
here before me.

340
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:49,593
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

341
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:52,630
<i>All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.</i>

342
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:54,766
The Great Shepherd sent me
to Earth to heal his--

343
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:02,408
Lamb or lion,

344
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:05,111
his wound must be
washed and sewn

345
00:32:05,145 --> 00:32:07,412
<i>or it will fester.</i>

346
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:39,310
For 30 years
I've been making corpses

347
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:41,178
out of men, boy.

348
00:32:41,213 --> 00:32:43,947
I'm the man you want
leading the vanguard.

349
00:32:45,316 --> 00:32:47,483
Galbart Glover
will lead the van.

350
00:32:47,518 --> 00:32:50,185
The bloody Wall will melt

351
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,288
before an Umber marches
behind a Glover.

352
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:56,358
<i>I will lead the van</i>

353
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,693
or I will take my men

354
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,828
and march them home.

355
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:08,436
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

356
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:11,540
And when I am done
with the Lannisters

357
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:13,875
I will march back north,

358
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,377
root you out of your keep

359
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,081
and hang you
for an oathbreaker.

360
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:20,116
Oathbreaker, is it?!

361
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:24,254
I'll not sit here
and swallow insults

362
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:26,823
from a boy so green
he pisses grass.

363
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:43,305
My Lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

364
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:45,407
<i>- against your liege lord.</i>

365
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:49,745
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant
to cut my meat for me.

366
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:54,217
Your meat...

367
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:02,026
is bloody tough.

368
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,629
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

369
00:34:40,102 --> 00:34:43,671
- Where are you going?
- South. For father.

370
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,407
But it's the middle
of the night.

371
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:47,575
The Lannisters have
spies everywhere.

372
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,177
I don't want them
to know we're coming.

373
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:52,914
They have more men than we do.

374
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:55,149
Aye, they do.

375
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:57,251
Can't I come with you?

376
00:34:57,286 --> 00:34:59,787
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.

377
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,923
And I won't get
in the way, I--

378
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:04,492
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

379
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:06,661
Until I return
that will be you.

380
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:12,400
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

381
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:18,407
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

382
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:20,577
I will.

383
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:22,679
I'll send letters
whenever I can,

384
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:24,949
but if you don't hear from me,

385
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:26,884
don't be scared.

386
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:34,192
Until I return.

387
00:35:54,415 --> 00:35:57,483
How long have you been
hiding out there?

388
00:35:57,518 --> 00:36:00,987
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

389
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,257
They've all gone away.

390
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,227
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father

391
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:09,463
and they'll come back
with mother.

392
00:36:11,132 --> 00:36:13,634
No, they won't.

393
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:20,408
<i>Bran: Please watch
over Robb.</i>

394
00:36:20,442 --> 00:36:22,910
And watch over all the
other men from Winterfell.

395
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:26,113
And Theon too, I suppose.

396
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,588
You hear them, boy?

397
00:36:34,623 --> 00:36:37,224
The Old Gods are answering you.

398
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:39,159
What are you doing here?

399
00:36:39,193 --> 00:36:42,062
They're my Gods too.

400
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:47,168
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only Gods.

401
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:50,839
Even slaves
are allowed to pray.

402
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:53,241
You're not a slave.

403
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:58,280
Well, your friend did
put a knife to my throat.

404
00:36:59,415 --> 00:37:02,017
I'm not complaining,
little lord,

405
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:04,786
just telling truths.

406
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:08,890
What did you mean
about hearing the Gods?

407
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:11,259
You asked them,

408
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:12,927
they're answering you.

409
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,931
Shh.

410
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:17,632
Open your ears.

411
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,306
It's only the wind.

412
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:28,343
Who do you think sends the wind

413
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:30,345
if not the Gods?

414
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,081
They see you, boy.

415
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:34,517
<i>They hear you.</i>

416
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,989
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

417
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,825
The Old Gods have
no power in the South.

418
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,529
The weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

419
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:48,333
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

420
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,239
Well, there's a big man.

421
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,442
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the Queen.

422
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,844
Go back and find
your clothes, Hodor.

423
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,712
<i>Go dress.</i>

424
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,280
Hodor.

425
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,619
Are there really giants
beyond the Wall?

426
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,957
Giants and worse than giants.

427
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,960
I tried telling your brother,

428
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,795
he's marching the wrong way.

429
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:22,332
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

430
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,534
North, not south!

431
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,673
The cold winds are rising.

432
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,993
They were touched
by White Walkers.

433
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:51,497
That's why they came back.

434
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:54,400
That's why their eyes
turned blue.

435
00:38:54,434 --> 00:38:57,569
Only fire will stop them.

436
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,273
How do you know that?

437
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:03,042
I read about it
in a book--

438
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:06,145
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

439
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,816
What else did the book say?

440
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,751
The White Walkers

441
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:15,554
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

442
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:18,124
And when they wake up--

443
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:22,962
And when they wake up, what?

444
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:28,434
I hope the Wall is high enough.

445
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,266
Summer snows, My Lady.

446
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:06,336
Robb's brought
the North with him.

447
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,411
The river lords
are falling back

448
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,280
with Jaime Lannister
at their heels.

449
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:19,717
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a
second Lannister army from the south.

450
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,521
Our scouts confirm it's even larger
than the Kingslayer's.

451
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:25,825
One army or two,
the Kings in the North

452
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,662
threw back hosts
10 times as large.

453
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,833
Mother!

454
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:40,471
You look well.

455
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:45,743
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

456
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,246
We had not thought
to meet you here, My Lady.

457
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:51,783
I had not thought to be here.

458
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,885
I would speak
with my son alone.

459
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:56,221
I know you will
forgive me, My Lords.

460
00:40:56,256 --> 00:40:58,490
You heard her!
Move your asses!

461
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,860
Come on, out.

462
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:03,530
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

463
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:05,466
Have no fear, My Lady.

464
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,268
<i>We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole</i>

465
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,071
and then it's on to the Red Keep
to free Ned.

466
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:14,039
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

467
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:16,408
You're not
wasting away, are you?

468
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:30,488
I remember the day
you came into this world

469
00:41:30,523 --> 00:41:33,558
red-faced and squalling.

470
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,729
And now I find you
leading a host to war.

471
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:41,166
- There was no one else.
- No one?

472
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,935
Who were those men I saw here?

473
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:47,039
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

474
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:50,109
If you think you can send me back
to Winterfell--

475
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:52,411
Oh, would that I could.

476
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:57,450
There was...

477
00:41:57,484 --> 00:41:59,919
a letter.

478
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:03,791
From Sansa.

479
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:07,060
From the Queen, you mean.

480
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:18,136
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

481
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:31,081
How many men do you have?

482
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,517
18,000.

483
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,019
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey--

484
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,122
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.

485
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,925
Our best hope--
our only hope--

486
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:45,262
is that you can defeat
them in the field.

487
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,330
And if I lose?

488
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,899
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

489
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,937
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

490
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,673
On the orders
of Tywin Lannister.

491
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,410
And the years have
not made him kinder.

492
00:43:01,514 --> 00:43:03,683
If you lose,

493
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:06,419
your father dies,

494
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:07,987
your sisters die,

495
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:10,255
<i>we die.</i>

496
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:14,859
Well, that makes it
simple then.

497
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:18,195
I suppose it does.

498
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:44,452
From here it might be best if
Bronn and I continue alone.

499
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:47,056
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin.

500
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,091
Not best for me.

501
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:52,295
If the half man betrays us,

502
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,765
Shagga Son of Dolf
will cut off his manhood--

503
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,335
And feed it to the goats, yes.

504
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,407
All right then.

505
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,643
Time to meet my father.

506
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,778
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

507
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:42,680
Father.

508
00:44:44,183 --> 00:44:47,184
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

509
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:50,620
Sorry to disappoint you.

510
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:53,190
And who are these...

511
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:55,458
<i>companions of yours?</i>

512
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,961
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

513
00:44:59,996 --> 00:45:02,364
<i>Chieftain of the Stone Crows.</i>

514
00:45:02,398 --> 00:45:06,768
<i>Timett Son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.</i>

515
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:11,540
<i>This fair maid is
Chella daughter of Cheyk,</i>

516
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:13,943
<i>leader of the Black Ears.</i>

517
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:17,346
And here we have
Bronn son of...

518
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,983
You wouldn't know him.

519
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:24,555
May I present my lord father,

520
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:27,224
Tywin son of Tytos
of House Lannister,

521
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:30,327
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?</i>

522
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,933
Kind of you
to go to war for me.

523
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:39,904
You left us no choice.

524
00:45:39,939 --> 00:45:42,006
The honor of the House
was at stake.

525
00:45:43,509 --> 00:45:46,678
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

526
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:49,247
We have our differences,
Jaime and I.

527
00:45:49,282 --> 00:45:51,450
He's braver.
I'm better looking.

528
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:53,819
He's been covering himself
in glory.

529
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:57,090
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

530
00:45:57,124 --> 00:46:00,793
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

531
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:02,928
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?

532
00:46:02,962 --> 00:46:07,032
--Is our hostage. He will lead
no armies from his dungeon cell.

533
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:09,101
How did my sweet sister
persuade the King

534
00:46:09,135 --> 00:46:11,003
to imprison
his dear friend Ned?

535
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:15,008
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

536
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:19,981
My sister rules, you mean.

537
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,484
Stark's son has
called his banners.

538
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:26,955
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

539
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:28,756
One taste of battle
and he'll run

540
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:31,360
back to Winterfell
with his tail between his legs.

541
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:34,062
Maybe.

542
00:46:34,096 --> 00:46:36,665
Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

543
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:39,201
You'd like him.

544
00:46:39,235 --> 00:46:43,272
While we're on
the subject of war,

545
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:46,008
I made promises
to my friends here

546
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:48,410
and a Lannister
always pays his debts.

547
00:46:48,444 --> 00:46:51,513
<i>We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,</i>

548
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:53,782
plus swords, pikes,

549
00:46:53,816 --> 00:46:55,617
gorgets, maces--

550
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:58,219
If it please My Lord,

551
00:46:58,253 --> 00:47:00,321
Ser Addam bids me report
that the Northmen

552
00:47:00,355 --> 00:47:01,755
have crossed the Neck.

553
00:47:03,758 --> 00:47:06,226
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws.

554
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,497
So be it. Kevan, command the
drummers beat assembly.

555
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,136
And send word to Jaime that
I am moving against Robb Stark.

556
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,138
At once, My Lord.

557
00:47:30,087 --> 00:47:33,055
It is said that the men of the
mountain clans are great warriors.

558
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,824
Ride with me against my enemies

559
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:37,894
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

560
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:40,163
Only if the half man
fights with us.

561
00:47:40,198 --> 00:47:43,634
Until we hold the steel
he pledged us,

562
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:46,070
the little lion's life is ours.

563
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:54,312
<i>Rodrik: The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.</i>

564
00:47:54,346 --> 00:47:56,180
We need to get him
on broken ground,

565
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:57,882
put his knights
at a disadvantage.

566
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,018
No, we need to get around him

567
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:02,954
and break Jaime Lannister's
siege of Riverrun.

568
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:05,824
Do that and the river lords
will join us.

569
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:07,726
To do either we need to cross
the river

570
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,427
and the only crossing
is at the Twins.

571
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:11,496
<i>Theon: Lord Frey controls
that bridge.</i>

572
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,097
Your father's bannerman.

573
00:48:13,131 --> 00:48:16,367
"The late Lord Frey"
my father calls him.

574
00:48:16,401 --> 00:48:19,904
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

575
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:23,975
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

576
00:48:31,383 --> 00:48:34,118
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

577
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:36,253
So what's it going to be?

578
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,690
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

579
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:45,396
Your pardon, my lords.

580
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:48,099
<i>We've captured
a Lannister scout.</i>

581
00:48:50,002 --> 00:48:53,338
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

582
00:48:54,674 --> 00:48:56,341
Where did you find him?

583
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:58,510
In the brush above
the encampment.

584
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:00,412
<i>He looked to be counting.</i>

585
00:49:10,857 --> 00:49:12,658
How high did you get?

586
00:49:15,028 --> 00:49:17,029
20,000.
Maybe more.

587
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:19,798
You don't have
to do this yourself.

588
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,399
Your father
would understand--

589
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:25,470
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

590
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:28,706
And he understands honor...

591
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:33,778
and courage.

592
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,515
Let him go.

593
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:40,885
Robb.

594
00:49:52,897 --> 00:49:55,865
Tell Lord Tywin
Winter is coming for him.

595
00:49:55,899 --> 00:50:00,836
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

596
00:50:02,906 --> 00:50:04,406
Yes, My Lord.

597
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,242
Thank you, My Lord.

598
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:19,388
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

599
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:21,458
You call me boy again.

600
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,594
Go on.

601
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:44,812
Oi.

602
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:52,553
<i>Pycelle: It is also the wish
of His Grace</i>

603
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:57,893
<i>that his loyal servant
Janos Slynt,</i>

604
00:50:57,927 --> 00:51:01,030
<i>- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.</i>

605
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:04,634
<i>...Be at once raised
to the rank of Lord...</i>

606
00:51:04,668 --> 00:51:10,139
<i>- Lord Gyles.
- And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,</i>

607
00:51:10,173 --> 00:51:14,009
<i>and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honor</i>

608
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:19,147
<i>after him
until the end of time.</i>

609
00:51:22,984 --> 00:51:26,319
In the place of the traitor
Eddard Stark,

610
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:31,024
<i>it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,</i>

611
00:51:31,058 --> 00:51:34,861
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,</i>

612
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:38,999
<i>be appointed Hand of the King.</i>

613
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:40,934
Lastly,

614
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:43,803
in these times
of treason and turmoil,

615
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:47,073
<i>it is the view of the Council</i>

616
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:49,642
that the life and safety

617
00:51:49,677 --> 00:51:52,345
of King Joffrey

618
00:51:52,379 --> 00:51:56,616
be of paramount importance.

619
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:00,753
Ser Barristan Selmy.

620
00:52:07,094 --> 00:52:10,597
Your Grace, I am
yours to command.

621
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:12,733
Rise, Ser Barristan.

622
00:52:13,602 --> 00:52:15,703
You may remove your helm.

623
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:23,246
<i>You have served the Realm
long and faithfully.</i>

624
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,250
<i>Every man and woman in the
Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.</i>

625
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:30,553
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

626
00:52:30,587 --> 00:52:33,490
<i>It is time to rest
and look back with pride</i>

627
00:52:33,524 --> 00:52:35,158
on your many years of service.

628
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,796
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

629
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:41,998
<i>Our vows are taken for life.</i>

630
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,535
Only death relieves us
of our sacred trust.

631
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:48,272
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?

632
00:52:48,306 --> 00:52:51,175
<i>Joffrey:
You let my father die.</i>

633
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:54,145
You're too old
to protect anybody.

634
00:52:56,449 --> 00:52:59,184
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined

635
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,653
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

636
00:53:01,688 --> 00:53:03,956
<i>as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.</i>

637
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,524
The man who profaned his blade

638
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:07,760
with the blood of the King
he had sworn to defend!

639
00:53:07,794 --> 00:53:09,728
Careful, Ser.

640
00:53:09,762 --> 00:53:11,463
We have nothing but gratitude

641
00:53:11,497 --> 00:53:13,966
for your long service,
good Ser.

642
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,468
You shall be given
a stout keep beside the sea,

643
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:18,837
with servants
to look after your every need.

644
00:53:18,871 --> 00:53:21,072
A hall to die in

645
00:53:21,107 --> 00:53:23,508
<i>and men to bury me.</i>

646
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,146
I am a knight.

647
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,216
I shall die a knight.

648
00:53:37,156 --> 00:53:39,291
A naked knight, apparently.

649
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,872
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

650
00:53:58,044 --> 00:54:00,578
Here, boy!

651
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:03,048
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

652
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:21,899
If any man in this hall
has other matters

653
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:25,068
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

654
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:28,339
or go forth and hold
his silence.

655
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,145
Your Grace.

656
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:35,548
Come forward, My Lady.

657
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:40,053
<i>Steward: The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.</i>

658
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:44,991
Do you have some business for
the King and the Council, Sansa?

659
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:46,860
I do.

660
00:54:51,732 --> 00:54:54,834
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

661
00:54:54,868 --> 00:54:58,338
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

662
00:54:58,372 --> 00:55:01,240
Treason is a noxious weed.

663
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:05,445
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.

664
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,182
I want to hear what she says.

665
00:55:08,216 --> 00:55:10,351
Thank you, Your Grace.

666
00:55:10,385 --> 00:55:12,988
Do you deny
your father's crime?

667
00:55:13,022 --> 00:55:17,493
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.

668
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:19,528
All I ask is mercy.

669
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:22,432
<i>I know My Lord father
must regret what he did.</i>

670
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:24,768
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

671
00:55:24,802 --> 00:55:27,003
You all know he loved him.

672
00:55:27,038 --> 00:55:30,640
He never wanted to be Hand
until the King asked him.

673
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:34,076
They must have lied to him--
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis

674
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:36,912
or somebody.
They must have lied!

675
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:39,415
He said I wasn't the King.

676
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:41,516
Why did he say that?

677
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:43,819
He was badly hurt.

678
00:55:43,853 --> 00:55:46,721
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

679
00:55:46,755 --> 00:55:50,925
He wasn't himself. Otherwise he
never would have said it.

680
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:57,131
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.

681
00:55:57,165 --> 00:56:00,835
<i>And yet they say
wisdom oft comes</i>

682
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,704
from the mouths of babes.

683
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:06,875
Treason is treason!

684
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,180
Anything else?

685
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,152
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

686
00:56:17,186 --> 00:56:20,688
please do me
this kindness, Your Grace.

687
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,532
Your sweet words have moved me.

688
00:56:34,936 --> 00:56:37,503
But your father has to confess.

689
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:41,140
He has to confess
and say that I'm the King...

690
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:46,178
Or there'll be
no mercy for him.

691
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,751
He will.

692
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:02,762
