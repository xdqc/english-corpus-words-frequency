1
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,479
Out, all of you.

2
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:06,318
Bastard's been meddling
where he shouldn't!

3
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,920
I want you and your men

4
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,731
gone.

5
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,134
And you will make
this right.

6
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,762
Wait outside.

7
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,732
- Lord Commander.
- Now!

8
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:45,461
- Lord Commander.
- Leave us.

9
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,612
What did you do?

10
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:50,613
I followed him.

11
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,083
He took the baby
into the woods, the newborn.

12
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:55,051
What business is that
of yours?

13
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:56,653
No, you don't understand.

14
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:59,089
He's killing them,
all the boys.

15
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:06,132
You know.

16
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:13,973
The wildlings serve
crueler Gods than you or I.

17
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:19,112
Those boys
are Craster's offerings.

18
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:20,647
Offerings?

19
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,417
He's murdering his own children.
He's a monster.

20
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:25,486
Aye, many a time that monster
has been the difference

21
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,055
between life and death
for our Rangers.

22
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,424
Your Uncle among them.

23
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:33,961
We have other wars
to fight out there.

24
00:03:33,995 --> 00:03:38,365
Like it or not,
we need men like Craster.

25
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,939
I...

26
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:46,674
I saw it.

27
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:52,613
I saw...

28
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,483
Something take
that child.

29
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:57,652
Yeah.

30
00:03:57,686 --> 00:03:59,854
Whatever it was,

31
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:02,224
I daresay
you'll see it again.

32
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:07,662
Now ready my horse.

33
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,998
We leave at dawn.

34
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:17,473
Don't lose it again.

35
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,468
Gilly.

36
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,140
You're leaving.

37
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:52,544
I-- I wanted
to give you something.

38
00:04:55,782 --> 00:04:58,283
It belonged
to my mother.

39
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,454
- I can't take it.
- Please.

40
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:04,289
I want you to.

41
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:09,828
My mother used it
for sewing.

42
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:13,031
She'd let me sit with her
in her chamber while she sewed

43
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,834
and I'd read to her.

44
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:21,006
My father put a stop
to it when he found out.

45
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,711
It's the only thing
I have of hers.

46
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:28,781
She gave it to me
before I left for the Wall.

47
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:30,883
You--

48
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,885
you shouldn't
give it away.

49
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,755
I'm not giving it away.

50
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,957
I'm giving it to you.

51
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,995
Keep it safe for me.

52
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,131
Till I come back.

53
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:04,818
Hodor.

54
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:06,887
Hodor.

55
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,957
Rouse Bran, will you?
It's time for his lessons.

56
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:45,093
Bran:
<i>Every night it's the same.</i>

57
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:47,429
I'm walking

58
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:50,031
and running, but...

59
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:54,904
I'm not--
I'm not me.

60
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,973
I'm running
through the Godswood,

61
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,308
sniffing the dirt,

62
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:03,678
tasting blood in my mouth when
I've made a fresh kill,

63
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,581
howling.

64
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,751
Old Nan used to
tell me stories

65
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:12,819
about magical people
who could live

66
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:17,557
inside stags,
birds, wolves.

67
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:19,559
That's exactly
what they are, Bran--

68
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:22,128
- stories.
- So she was lying?

69
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:25,431
- They don't exist?
- Well, they may have done.

70
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:28,034
But they're gone
from the world

71
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:30,869
along with much else.

72
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:34,406
These are dreams, Bran,

73
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,941
nothing more.

74
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:38,677
No, my dreams
are different.

75
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:40,913
<i>Mine are true.</i>

76
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:43,482
I dreamt of my father dying.

77
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:46,185
And Rickon had
the same dream.

78
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,088
What about all the dreams
you had that didn't come true?

79
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,159
Hmm?

80
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:02,603
This link is made
of Valyrian steel.

81
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:06,573
Only one Maester in 100
wears it on his chain.

82
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:10,577
It signifies that I have
studied the higher mysteries.

83
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:14,781
And all who study these mysteries
try their hand at spells.

84
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,717
I was no different.

85
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,819
I was young.

86
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:23,423
And what boy doesn't secretly
wish for hidden powers

87
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:27,561
to lift him out of his
dull life into a special one?

88
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:30,430
But in the end,
for all my efforts,

89
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:33,700
I got no more out of it
than 1,000 boys before me.

90
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:36,669

Come on.

91
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,579
All right.

92
00:08:47,613 --> 00:08:51,783
Maybe magic once was
a mighty force in the world.

93
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,653
But not anymore.

94
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,524
The Dragons are gone.

95
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:01,893
The Giants are dead.

96
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:06,397
And the Children
of the Forest forgotten.

97
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:59,518
Loras!
Highgarden!

98
00:10:02,522 --> 00:10:04,557
Get him!

99
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:11,296
Crowd:
Oh!

100
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:14,933
Yield!
I yield.

101
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:26,412
Well fought.
Approach.

102
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:38,457
Rise.
Remove your helm.

103
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,202
You are all your father
promised and more, My Lady.

104
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,537
I've seen Ser Loras
bested once or twice,

105
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:53,638
but never quite
in that fashion.

106
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:57,710
Now, now, my love. My brother
fought valiantly for you.

107
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,414
That he did, my Queen.

108
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:04,717
But there can only be
one champion.

109
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,819
Brienne of Tarth,

110
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,722
<i>you may ask anything</i>
<i>of me you desire.</i>

111
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:11,758
If it is within my power,
it is yours.

112
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:15,295
Your Grace,

113
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,464
I ask the honor of a place
in your Kingsguard.

114
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:20,333
What?

115
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,536
I will be one of your seven,
pledge my life to yours,

116
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,905
and keep you safe
from all harm.

117
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:31,311
Done.

118
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:34,513
Rise, Brienne
of the Kingsguard.

119
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:46,758
Your Grace, I have the honor to
bring you Lady Catelyn Stark,

120
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,860
sent as an envoy by her son Robb,
Lord of Winterfell.

121
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:53,531
Lord of Winterfell
and King in the North.

122
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:57,168
Lady Catelyn.
I'm pleased to see you.

123
00:11:57,202 --> 00:12:00,672
May I present my wife
Margaery of House Tyrell?

124
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:04,210
You are very welcome
here, Lady Stark.

125
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:06,346
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

126
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,216
You are most kind.

127
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,784
My Lady,

128
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,453
I swear to you I will see
the Lannisters answer

129
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:16,689
for your husband's murder.

130
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:19,124
When I take King's Landing,

131
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,192
I'll bring you
Joffrey's head.

132
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:33,070
It will be enough to know that
justice was done, My Lord.

133
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:35,573
Brienne:
<i>Your Grace.</i>

134
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,976
And you should kneel
when you approach the King.

135
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,379
There's no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honored guest.

136
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:43,816
Has your son marched against
Tywin Lannister yet?

137
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:47,854
I do not sit on
my son's war councils.

138
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:51,791
And if I did, I would not share his
strategies with you.

139
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:54,760
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself,

140
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,829
not hide behind
his mother's skirts.

141
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:59,865
My son is fighting a war,

142
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:01,800
not playing at one.

143
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,981
Don't worry, My Lady.

144
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:19,083
Our war is just beginning.

145
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:34,498
- Your Grace.
- Gerard.

146
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:37,167
- How's your foot?
- Better, Your Grace.

147
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,502
They don't know
their own size is all.

148
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:41,671
Good man.

149
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,541
I have 100,000 men
at my command.

150
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,177
All the might of the Stormlands
and the Reach.

151
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:51,547
And all of them young and bold
like your Knight of Flowers?

152
00:13:52,716 --> 00:13:55,285
It's a game to you,
isn't it?

153
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,587
- I pity them.
- Why?

154
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:59,489
Because it won't last.

155
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:03,794
Because they are the Knights of summer
and winter is coming.

156
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:09,468
Brienne, escort
Lady Catelyn to her tent.

157
00:14:09,502 --> 00:14:12,505
- She's tired from her journey.
- <i>At once, Your Grace.</i>

158
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,774
- Shall I return after?
- <i>That won't be necessary.</i>

159
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:18,144
I would pray awhile.
Alone.

160
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:21,447
If you'll follow me,
My Lady.

161
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,086
You fought bravely today,
Lady Brienne.

162
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,488
I fought for my King.

163
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:32,191
Soon I'll fight for him
on the battlefield.

164
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:34,893
Die for him
if I must.

165
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:39,097
And, if it please you,
Brienne's enough.

166
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:41,333
I'm no lady.

167
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,634
What are you doing here?

168
00:15:14,669 --> 00:15:16,870
I live here.

169
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:21,008
- Are you angry with me, brother?
- You lying bitch.

170
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:24,044
It's not my fault
you didn't recognize me.

171
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,314
Recognize you?
How could I?

172
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:29,216
The last time I saw you...

173
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:32,753
You looked like
a fat little boy.

174
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,423
You were a fat
little boy, too,

175
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,993
but I recognized you.

176
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:40,461
Why didn't you tell me?

177
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:42,531
I wanted to see
who you were first.

178
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,566
( Laughs )
And I did.

179
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,839
The plans are made.
It's time you heard them.

180
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:52,741
- Father.
- Father.

181
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:56,578
The wolf pup
has gone south

182
00:15:56,613 --> 00:16:00,148
with the entirety of the northern
army at his back.

183
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:02,484
While he's tangling with
the lion in the Westerlands,

184
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,253
the north is ripe
for the taking.

185
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:08,890
The Ironborn will reave and
pillage as it was in the old days

186
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,925
all along the northern coast.

187
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,996
We'll spread our dominion
across the green lands,

188
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,899
<i>securing the Neck</i>
<i>and everything above.</i>

189
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,836
Every stronghold will yield
to us one by one.

190
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:22,539
Winterfell may defy us
for a year, but what of it?

191
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,575
The rest shall be ours--

192
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,079
forest, field and hall.

193
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:35,019
Yara, my daughter,
you'll take 30 longships

194
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:36,922
<i>to attack Deepwood Motte.</i>

195
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:39,024
I've always wanted
a castle.

196
00:16:39,058 --> 00:16:41,726
And what's my role
in all this?

197
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:46,865
You'll take a ship to raid the
fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

198
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,633
A ship?

199
00:16:48,668 --> 00:16:50,702
You give her 30
and I get one?

200
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:54,239
The sea bitch. We thought
she'd be perfect for you.

201
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,843
I'm to fight fishermen?

202
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:00,280
Be careful
of their nets.

203
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:07,622
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.

204
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:09,424
He won't give up
the North so easily.

205
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,259
They won't even know we're
there until it's too late.

206
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:12,593
What do you
know of it, woman?

207
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:14,362
I'm a proven warrior.

208
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:17,498
Your brothers were warriors,
both of them dead

209
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:21,168
at the hands of those
you seem so eager to protect.

210
00:17:22,837 --> 00:17:24,671
I'm not protecting anyone.

211
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:26,973
I just wonder
if it's not wiser to wait.

212
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:30,710
Why risk going against the North
if they would be our allies?

213
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:33,379
Rise up against them
and they could destroy us.

214
00:17:33,414 --> 00:17:35,849
But if we pledge
fealty to them,

215
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:37,918
they'll give us
Casterly Rock.

216
00:17:37,952 --> 00:17:40,956
What are our words?

217
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,824
Our words?

218
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:48,031
- "We do not sow."
- "We do not sow."

219
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:49,833
We are Ironborn.

220
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:52,702
We're not subjects.
We're not slaves.

221
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,839
We do not plow the fields
or toil in the mine.

222
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:58,876
We take what is ours.

223
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,413
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

224
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,086
You act as if
I volunteered to go.

225
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:12,089
You gave me away,
if you remember.

226
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,425
The day you bent the knee
to Robert Baratheon.

227
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:16,727
After he crushed you.

228
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,629
Did you take
what was yours then?

229
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,268
You gave me away!

230
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,438
Your boy!

231
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,841
Your last boy!

232
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,644
You gave me away like I was some dog
you didn't want anymore.

233
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,048
And now you curse me
because I've come home.

234
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,361
You'd have our father bow
down to your other family?

235
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,963
I have no other family.

236
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,032
Don't you?

237
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,569
Make your choice, Theon,
and do it quickly.

238
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,372
Our ships sail
with or without you.

239
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,185
You won't let me
leave this room.

240
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,222
- You won't let me--
- Shh, shh, keep your voice down.

241
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:24,328
Why? You think your father
can hear me?

242
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,997
He's 300 miles away!

243
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,035
I don't intend for you
to stay here.

244
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,972
I might be able to bring you into
the castle kitchens.

245
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:38,675
Again, only temporary.

246
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,244
Every man who has
tasted my cooking

247
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,280
has told me what
a good whore I am.

248
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,282
But you wouldn't
be a cook.

249
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:49,019
You'd pose
as a scullion.

250
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,256
Scullion?
What is a scullion?

251
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,959
Kitchen wench.

252
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,662
- A kitchen wench?
- Yes, but--

253
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,190
Cleaning pots?

254
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,783
Is that how my lion
wants to see me?

255
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,602
Your lion wants
to see you alive.

256
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,071
We've come to
a dangerous place.

257
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,906
My sister wants to hurt me.

258
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,108
She'll look for any
weakness she can find.

259
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,010
She can't know about you.

260
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:15,145
I'm the weakness?

261
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,646
It's a compliment,
My Lady.

262
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,349
How is being a weakness
a compliment?

263
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,121
Language can be
a bit tricky here.

264
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:28,991
Oh, I'm too stupid
to understand.

265
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:31,393
The stupid foreign girl.

266
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,132
I am not
a kitchen wench.

267
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:04,358
When will Joffrey
and Sansa be married?

268
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:06,926
Soon, darling,
when the war is over.

269
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:09,862
Mother says I'll have
a new gown for the ceremony

270
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:12,332
and another for the feast.

271
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:15,435
But yours will be ivory
since you're the bride.

272
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,776
The Princess
just spoke to you.

273
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,879
Pardon, Your Grace.

274
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,550
I'm sure your dress will
be beautiful, Myrcella.

275
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:32,120
I'm counting the days
until the fighting is done

276
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:36,224
and I can pledge my love to
the King in sight of the Gods.

277
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:42,696
Is Joffrey going to kill
Sansa's brother?

278
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:47,300
He might.

279
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,370
Would you like that?

280
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:55,541
No.
I don't think so.

281
00:21:56,777 --> 00:22:00,446
Even if he does,
Sansa will do her duty.

282
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:04,217
Won't you, little dove?

283
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:23,836
Come in.

284
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:29,008
Who are you?

285
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,944
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

286
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:35,381
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

287
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:39,786
- You're not from here.
- No.

288
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:47,429
What are you doing?

289
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:49,331
Waiting for you
to tell me what to do.

290
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:51,600
I shouldn't have to tell
you to do things.

291
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:53,870
You should just do them.

292
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,072
What things?

293
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:58,174
Change my linens,
wash my clothing,

294
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,811
scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot,
brush my hair.

295
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:12,488
- No.
- You said to brush--

296
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:15,324
Not now.

297
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:19,762
Your chamber pot
is empty.

298
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,065
Clean the table.

299
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,472
Have you ever been
a handmaiden before?

300
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:31,541
- Yes.
- For whom?

301
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,576
- Lady Zuriff.
- Lady Zuriff?

302
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,480
Lady Zuriff.

303
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:41,218
There is no Lady Zuriff
in this city.

304
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:43,153
She wasn't in
this city.

305
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:45,589
Well, I don't know how
they did things in that city,

306
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:48,558
but in this city,
handmaidens wait on ladies,

307
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,127
not the other way around.

308
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,063
And I don't have time
to answer 1,000 questions

309
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,565
and teach you
how to do your job.

310
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,403
Do you want me to leave?

311
00:24:08,312 --> 00:24:10,347
Just brush my hair.

312
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,233
Oh, thank the Gods.

313
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,502
I haven't had
a proper shit in six days.

314
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:33,039
I've encountered this
problem before, My Lord.

315
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:36,576
The stresses of power
often have this

316
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,411
insalubrious effect.

317
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:41,580
Two drops
with water daily.

318
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,482
Right. I'm so grateful
to have a man

319
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:46,218
of your vast knowledge
and wisdom on my side.

320
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:49,121
- Please.
- Thank you, My Lord.

321
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,029
I can trust you,
Pycelle, can I not?

322
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:57,864
Why, yes, of course,
My Lord.

323
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:00,067
These are perilous times.

324
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:02,069
And the crown must forge
new alliances.

325
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:07,209
And these alliances must often
be sealed in matrimony.

326
00:25:07,243 --> 00:25:09,745
Matrimony, huh?

327
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,681
Yes.

328
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,916
I'm trusting the council
with these plans,

329
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,685
but the queen mustn't know.

330
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:18,287
We can't have her
meddling in affairs

331
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:19,667
that could determine
the future of the realm.

332
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:20,892
There's too much at stake.

333
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:24,026
Oh, yes, yes.
Indeed, yes.

334
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:27,329
I shall be silent
as the grave.

335
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:31,433
I'm brokering an alliance
with House Martell of Dorne.

336
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:33,936
Princess Myrcella will wed
their youngest son

337
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,906
when she comes of age,
ensuring their loyalty

338
00:25:36,941 --> 00:25:39,610
and their army
should we need it.

339
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:43,615
Myrcella sent away
to Dorne?

340
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:48,688
But remember,
the queen mustn't know.

341
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:51,991
Ooh, "the queen
mustn't know."

342
00:25:52,026 --> 00:25:55,561
I love conversations
that begin this way.

343
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:58,831
I plan to marry
Princess Myrcella off

344
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:00,566
to Theon Greyjoy.

345
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:04,337
Theon Greyjoy?

346
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:07,106
Forgive me, My Lord,?

347
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,009
He grew up a ward
of Winterfell.

348
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:11,677
He fights
for Robb Stark.

349
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:15,247
Precisely. Theon's father
loathes the Starks

350
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:18,050
and will convince the boy
to come to our side.

351
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,553
Greyjoy can destroy
the northern army from within

352
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:24,122
<i>and we can have</i>
<i>his father's ships.</i>

353
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:27,659
But remember,
you must tell no one.

354
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:30,229
Tell no one what?

355
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:34,233
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to
Robin Arryn of the Vale.

356
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:39,104
Lysa is not fond of me.

357
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,474
But perhaps the promise
of a royal match

358
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:44,743
will convince her
to let bygones be bygones.

359
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,712
She imprisoned you.

360
00:26:46,746 --> 00:26:48,814
She tried
to execute you.

361
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:51,783
And you offer
her son a princess?

362
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,653
For men in our position,
holding grudges can be

363
00:26:55,688 --> 00:26:57,455
an encumbrance,
don't you think?

364
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,860
And I suppose you want me
to broker this agreement?

365
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,528
Who better?

366
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:10,134
Yes, I could sing
this song to Lysa,

367
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:12,403
if I cared to.

368
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:14,639
What's in it
for me?

369
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,778
The gratitude of
the people of Westeros

370
00:27:18,812 --> 00:27:20,513
for helping to end
this war,

371
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:24,718
the adoration of the King for
bringing the Vale back into the fold...

372
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,389
and Harrenhal.

373
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:30,824
Harrenhal is cursed.

374
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,760
Never took you
for a superstitious man.

375
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,694
By all means,
tear it down and rebuild.

376
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:36,496
You'll be able
to afford it.

377
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,332
I plan to make you
Lord of the Riverlands.

378
00:27:41,234 --> 00:27:44,036
With a single stroke,
you'd make me one of the
greatest lords in the realm.

379
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,305
You served my family well
in the matter of the succession.

380
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,542
So did Janos Slynt, and he
was given Harrenhal, too.

381
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:53,478
Until you snatched it away.

382
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:55,814
I need you to
deliver Lysa Arryn.

383
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:58,584
I didn't need
Janos Slynt.

384
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:03,456
<i>It's settled, then?</i>

385
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,192
Good.

386
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:10,630
Oh, and remember--

387
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:12,499
the queen mustn't know.

388
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:53,041
That must hurt.

389
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:05,287
What?

390
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:08,356
What is it?

391
00:29:10,426 --> 00:29:13,295
A member of the Kingsguard?

392
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:16,165
As if I wasn't humiliated
enough already.

393
00:29:18,468 --> 00:29:22,705
Brienne is a very
capable warrior.

394
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:26,275
And she's devoted to me.

395
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:30,513
You're jealous.

396
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:32,449
Jealous?

397
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,651
Of Brienne the beauty?

398
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,752
Don't make me laugh.

399
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:42,124
- I'll make it up to you.
- No, Your Grace.

400
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,461
Not tonight.

401
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:48,130
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

402
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:52,034
You didn't win
my father's support
or his army
on charm alone.

403
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:09,451
Your vassals are starting
to snigger behind your back.

404
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:12,454
Brides aren't usually virgins
two weeks after their wedding night.

405
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:14,357
And Margaery's a virgin?

406
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:16,593
Officially.

407
00:30:17,928 --> 00:30:19,963
Shall I bring her
to you?

408
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,663
I should warn you,

409
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,631
I've had quite
a bit of wine.

410
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:53,201
As is your right.
You are a King.

411
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,273
You look
very beautiful.

412
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,174
Thank you,
Your Grace.

413
00:30:59,209 --> 00:31:03,146
- It's a lovely gown.
- <i>You think so?</i>

414
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,916
I can't decide
how I like it better.

415
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:08,052
This way...

416
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:11,089
or this way.

417
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,863
You certainly don't need it.

418
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:21,967
Although...

419
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:25,604
some say that
beauty most desired

420
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:27,406
is the beauty concealed.

421
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:46,093
Must be the wine.

422
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:48,695
Here, let me.

423
00:32:08,682 --> 00:32:10,650
I'm sorry.

424
00:32:10,684 --> 00:32:12,852
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

425
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:18,258
- What?
- He could get you started.

426
00:32:18,292 --> 00:32:19,624
I know he wouldn't mind.

427
00:32:19,649 --> 00:32:22,228
Or I can turn over and you
can pretend I'm him.

428
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:27,034
I don't know what
you're talking about.

429
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:35,010
There's no need
for us to play games.

430
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:38,247
Save your lies for court.
You're going to need a lot of them.

431
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,768
Your enemies
aren't happy about us.

432
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:02,137
They want to tear
us apart.

433
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:05,240
And the best way
to stop them

434
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,577
is to put your baby

435
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,079
in my belly.

436
00:33:13,982 --> 00:33:16,485
We can try again later.

437
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,387
You decide how
you want to do it--

438
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:20,289
with me,
with me and Loras.

439
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:22,792
However else you like.

440
00:33:25,163 --> 00:33:27,864
Whatever you need to do.

441
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:33,170
You are a King.

442
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,747
Cersei:
<i>You monster.</i>

443
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,116
Myrcella is my only daughter.

444
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,819
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

445
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:50,387
Myrcella's a Princess.

446
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,055
Some would say
she was born for this.

447
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,757
I will not let you
ship her off to Dorne

448
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,926
as I was shipped off
to Robert Baratheon.

449
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,261
Dorne is the safest place
or her.

450
00:33:58,295 --> 00:34:01,698
Are you mad?
The Martells loathe us.

451
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:04,167
That's why we need
to seduce them.

452
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:06,035
We're going to need
their support in the war

453
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,937
your son started.

454
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:10,206
- She'll be a hostage.
- A guest.

455
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:12,843
You won't get away
with this.

456
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:16,813
You think the piece of paper father
gave you keeps you safe.

457
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,319
Ned Stark had a piece
of paper, too.

458
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:26,689
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

459
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:30,927
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

460
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,398
<i>Just how safe do you think</i>
<i>Myrcella is if this city falls?</i>

461
00:34:36,432 --> 00:34:40,268
Do you want to see her raped,
butchered like the Targaryen children?

462
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:42,537
Make no mistake.

463
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:45,173
They'll mount her pretty little head
on a spike right beside yours.

464
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:47,508
Get out!
Get out!

465
00:35:49,036 --> 00:35:51,938
Theon of
the House Greyjoy,

466
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:55,609
you would this day consecrate
your faith to the drowned God?

467
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:06,422
- I would.
- <i>Kneel.</i>

468
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,160
Let Theon,
your servant,

469
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:14,364
be born again from
the sea as you were.

470
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:17,133
Bless him with salt.

471
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,305
Bless him with stone.

472
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,107
Bless him with steel.

473
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,415
What is dead
may never die.

474
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:33,551
What is dead
may never die...

475
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,689
But rises again
harder and stronger.

476
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:40,825
Stand.

477
00:37:09,624 --> 00:37:14,194
I don't appreciate being
made a fool of, dwarf.

478
00:37:14,229 --> 00:37:15,729
If Myrcella marries
the Martell boy,

479
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:17,997
she can't very well
marry Robin Arryn, can she?

480
00:37:18,032 --> 00:37:21,167
No, afraid not.
Sorry about that.

481
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:23,002
And Harrenhal--

482
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:26,105
I suppose that's
off the table as well.

483
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:29,842
Yes, I fear so.
Sorry about that, too.

484
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:32,043
Leave me out of your
next deception.

485
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:34,079
Oh, that's a shame.

486
00:37:34,113 --> 00:37:37,415
You were to be the centerpiece of
my next deception.

487
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,719
My brother Jaime rots
in a Northern stockade.

488
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:42,955
I would see him released.

489
00:37:42,989 --> 00:37:44,456
That's where you come in.

490
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:46,959
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

491
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:50,630
No, he won't.
But his mother might.

492
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:53,567
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

493
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:59,273
- Find him?
- Oh, aye.

494
00:37:59,308 --> 00:38:01,242
And he has company.

495
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,647
Filthy old stoat.
Almost hate to interrupt.

496
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:09,051
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

497
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:18,661
What is the meaning
of this?

498
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,697
No, please, please.

499
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,132
You disappoint me,
Grand Maester.

500
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,902
I am your loyal servant.

501
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,738
So loyal that you told
the Queen about my plans

502
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,368
to send Myrcella to Dorne.

503
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:31,173
No! Never!

504
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,843
It's a falsehood.
I swear it.

505
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:35,345
It wasn't me.

506
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,080
Ah, Varys.

507
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,216
It was Varys
the spider.

508
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:44,387
See, I told Varys that I was giving
the Princess to the Greyjoys.

509
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:48,958
I told Littlefinger that I planned
to wed her to Robin Arryn.

510
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:52,429
I told no one that I was
offering her to the Dornish.

511
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,031
No one but you.

512
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,600
The eunuch has
spies everywhere.

513
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,036
Cut off his manhood
and feed it to the goats.

514
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,505
- No, no, no.
- There are no goats, halfman.

515
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,574
Well, make do.

516
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,979
How long have you
been spying for my sister?

517
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,615
All I did, I did
for House Lannister.

518
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,117
<i>Always. Your lord father,</i>
<i>ask him.</i>

519
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,952
I've always been
his servant

520
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:17,888
since the days
of the Mad King.

521
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:22,527
- I don't like his beard.
- What?

522
00:39:22,562 --> 00:39:24,363
What?
Oh, no. No.

523
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:30,670
How many hands have you
betrayed, Pycelle?

524
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:33,139
Eddard Stark?
Jon Arryn?

525
00:39:33,174 --> 00:39:34,907
Lord Arryn,
he knew.

526
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:37,877
He knew the truth
about the queen.

527
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:41,513
And, well,
he planned to act,

528
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,382
to tell King Robert.

529
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,716
So you poisoned him?

530
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:47,118
No. Never.

531
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:49,987
But you let him die,
made sure he succumbed.

532
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:52,556
Lannister--
I always served Lannister.

533
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:55,258
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.

534
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,160
Oh, no. No, no, no.
No, please.

535
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,362
<i>Don't!</i>
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

536
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,165
For your trouble.

537
00:40:26,455 --> 00:40:29,057
You'll be pleased to know
our mutual friend

538
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:32,493
<i>is doing quite well</i>
<i>in Lady Sansa's service.</i>

539
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:35,896
Good.
One of my better ideas.

540
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,265
And it seems
the Grand Maester

541
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:40,734
has found his way
into a black cell.

542
00:40:42,703 --> 00:40:45,204
Well played,
My Lord Hand.

543
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,640
But should I be worried?

544
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:50,642
Janos Slynt,
Pycelle--

545
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:53,979
the small council
grows smaller every day.

546
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:56,882
The council has a reputation
for serving past Hands poorly.

547
00:40:56,916 --> 00:41:00,052
I don't mean to follow
Ned Stark to the grave.

548
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:04,456
Power is a curious thing,
My Lord.

549
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:06,625
Are you fond of riddles?

550
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,627
Why, am I about
to hear one?

551
00:41:08,662 --> 00:41:11,096
Three great men
sit in a room.

552
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:13,733
A king, a priest
and a rich man.

553
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:16,536
Between them stands
a common Sellsword.

554
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,507
<i>Each great man bids the</i>
<i>Sellsword kill the other two.</i>

555
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:23,310
Who lives, who dies?

556
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:25,580
Depends on the Sellsword.

557
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:27,749
Does it?
He has neither crown

558
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:30,018
nor gold nor favor
with the Gods.

559
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:32,287
He has a sword,
the power of life and death.

560
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:34,456
But if it's swordsmen
who rule,

561
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,992
why do we pretend
Kings hold all the power?

562
00:41:37,026 --> 00:41:39,761
<i>When Ned Stark</i>
<i>lost his head,</i>

563
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:42,597
<i>who was truly responsible?</i>

564
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:44,966
Joffrey?
The executioner?

565
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,567
Or something else?

566
00:41:46,602 --> 00:41:48,936
I've decided
I don't like riddles.

567
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:56,177
Power resides where
men believe it resides.

568
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,079
It's a trick,

569
00:41:58,113 --> 00:42:00,849
a shadow on the wall.

570
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:04,720
And a very small man

571
00:42:04,754 --> 00:42:07,289
can cast a very large shadow.

572
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:49,799
You should be sleeping.

573
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,101
Tomorrow's a long march.

574
00:42:53,136 --> 00:42:56,104
30 miles if it
don't piss on us.

575
00:42:57,406 --> 00:42:59,040
I can't sleep.

576
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,579
I don't like the taste.

577
00:43:08,016 --> 00:43:11,251
Well...

578
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:14,988
You don't drink it
for the flavor, to be honest.

579
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:24,096
What?

580
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,699
How do you sleep?

581
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:29,935
Same as most men,
I think.

582
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:32,637
But you've seen things,

583
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:35,941
horrible things.

584
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:38,611
Aye.

585
00:43:38,645 --> 00:43:41,647
I've seen some
pretty things, too,

586
00:43:41,682 --> 00:43:43,917
but not nearly so many.

587
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:47,355
How do you sleep
when you--

588
00:43:49,558 --> 00:43:53,895
when you have those
things in your head?

589
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:58,667
You didn't see that.

590
00:43:58,701 --> 00:44:00,269
I made damn sure.

591
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:02,538
I close my eyes
and I see them up there.

592
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:06,309
All of them

593
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,945
standing there--

594
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,547
Joffrey,

595
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,150
the Queen,

596
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,552
and--

597
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,988
and my sister.

598
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:31,900
You know, we've got something
in common, me and you.

599
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:34,269
You know that?

600
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:36,839
I must have been

601
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:39,342
a couple of years
older than you.

602
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,647
I saw my brother stabbed
through the heart

603
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,716
<i>right on our doorstep.</i>

604
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,286
<i>He weren't much of a villain</i>
<i>what skewered him.</i>

605
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:51,922
<i>Willem, the lad's name was.</i>

606
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:56,794
He ran off before
anyone could spit.

607
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:00,031
And I just stood there,

608
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,734
watching my brother die.

609
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:07,038
<i>But here's the funny part.</i>

610
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:10,275
I can't picture
my brother's face anymore.

611
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,944
<i>But Willem--</i>

612
00:45:12,979 --> 00:45:15,948
oh, he was
a nice-looking boy.

613
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,751
He had good white teeth,

614
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:22,088
blue eyes,

615
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:25,858
<i>one of those dimpled chins</i>
<i>all the girls like.</i>

616
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:31,097
<i>I would think about him</i>
<i>when I was working,</i>

617
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:35,201
when I was drinking,
when I was having a shit.

618
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,503
It got to the point

619
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:40,773
where I would say his name
every night before I went to bed.

620
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:43,308
Willem. Willem.

621
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:46,078
<i>Willem.</i>

622
00:45:46,112 --> 00:45:48,280
A prayer almost.

623
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:52,717
<i>Well, one day...</i>

624
00:45:53,886 --> 00:45:57,789
<i>Willem came riding</i>
<i>back into town.</i>

625
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:03,995
I buried an ax so deep
into Willem's skull,

626
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:07,832
<i>they had to bury</i>
<i>him with it.</i>

627
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:11,169
Willem's horse
got me to the Wall

628
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:13,971
and I've been wearing
black ever since.

629
00:46:17,977 --> 00:46:19,979
Well...

630
00:46:20,013 --> 00:46:22,982
that'll help you sleep, eh?

631
00:46:29,157 --> 00:46:30,424
Ho!

632
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:33,627
Get up, you lazy
sons of whores!

633
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:36,530
Arm yourselves.

634
00:46:36,564 --> 00:46:38,198
- Gendry: Get up.
- Arya: Get up.

635
00:46:38,233 --> 00:46:40,100
Keep out of sight,
both of you.

636
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,668
- No, I'm not afraid.
- I can fight.

637
00:46:41,702 --> 00:46:43,937
Keep out of sight.

638
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:46,539
If things go wrong,
you run.

639
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:47,802
Do you hear me?

640
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:50,509
You run along North
and don't look back.

641
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:53,279
Hey, there's men
out there

642
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:55,549
who want to fuck
your corpses.

643
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:58,251
Outside, now!

644
00:46:59,454 --> 00:47:01,522

<i>Come on, move, move!</i>

645
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:04,993
Gold Cloaks!

646
00:47:10,934 --> 00:47:12,835
Everyone out!

647
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,476
Hey, you!
Open the damn cage!

648
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,816
Where's the bastard, Crow?

649
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:28,620
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who's asking?

650
00:47:28,654 --> 00:47:31,389
Ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman
to Lord Tywin Lannister.

651
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:35,593
<i>These men from the capital</i>
<i>requested our assistance.</i>

652
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:37,494
Drop your weapons
in the name of the King.

653
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:39,563
Now, which King
would that be?

654
00:47:39,597 --> 00:47:41,498
This is your last chance.

655
00:47:41,532 --> 00:47:44,233
In the name
of King Joffrey,

656
00:47:44,267 --> 00:47:46,502
drop your weapons.

657
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:51,973

I don't think I will.

658
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:54,175
So be it.

659
00:47:56,879 --> 00:48:00,415
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.

660
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:40,357
Jaqen: Boy, come here.
Boy!

661
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:43,927
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Come back here!

662
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:45,228
Help us, boy!

663
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:51,801
A man can fight!
Free us!

664
00:48:58,275 --> 00:49:00,777
Quick, give it to me.

665
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:04,981
Give me the ax.
Give me that.

666
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:14,990

<i>Put 'em on the wagon!</i>

667
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:16,992
<i>There's more here.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

668
00:49:22,265 --> 00:49:25,767
What do we have here?

669
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:27,768
No!

670
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:31,238
That's a fine
little blade.

671
00:49:31,273 --> 00:49:33,674
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

672
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,509
I yield!
I yield!

673
00:49:35,544 --> 00:49:37,779
Amory:
<i>Round up any survivors.</i>

674
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:39,881
We'll take them back
to Harrenhal.

675
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:43,052
You heard him.
You're coming with us.

676
00:49:43,086 --> 00:49:45,588
I yield!

677
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,962
Help!

678
00:49:51,996 --> 00:49:54,098
Help me!

679
00:49:57,635 --> 00:49:59,336
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

680
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,372
Look at it.

681
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,848
Can you walk?

682
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:13,617
No.
You got to carry me.

683
00:50:14,653 --> 00:50:16,821
All right.

684
00:50:30,136 --> 00:50:32,671
Carry him, he says.

685
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,648
We're looking for
a bastard named Gendry.

686
00:50:43,683 --> 00:50:46,685
<i>Give him up</i>

687
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:48,987
or I'll start
taking eyeballs.

688
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:03,068
You want Gendry?

689
00:51:06,506 --> 00:51:08,807
You already got him.

690
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:15,480
<i>He loved that helmet.</i>
