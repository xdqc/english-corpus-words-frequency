1
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:12,557
- You swear it?
- By the mother.

2
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,228
My son has no interest
in the Iron Throne.

3
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:25,905
Then I see no reason
for hostility between us.

4
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,641
Your son can go on calling
himself King in the North,

5
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:32,212
the Starks will have dominion over
all lands north of Moat Cailin,

6
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,348
provided he swears me
an oath of fealty.

7
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:35,682
And the wording
of this oath?

8
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,485
The same Ned Stark swore
to Robert 18 years ago.

9
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:44,258
Cat, their friendship held
the kingdoms together.

10
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:51,399
And in return
for my son's loyalty?

11
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:54,569
In the morning I'll destroy
my brother's army.

12
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,070
When that's done,

13
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,506
Baratheon and Stark
will fight

14
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,375
their common enemy
together,

15
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,677
as they have done
many times before.

16
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:12,155
Our two houses
have always been close,

17
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,992
which is why I am begging you
to reconsider this battle.

18
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:17,626
Negotiate a peace
with your brother.

19
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,395
Negotiate with Stannis?

20
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:22,197
You heard him out there.

21
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:25,200
I'd have better luck
debating the wind.

22
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,737
Please bring my terms
to your son.

23
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:32,072
I believe we are
natural allies.

24
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:33,741
I hope he feels
the same.

25
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:36,644
Together we could end
this war in a fortnight.

26
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,630
No!

27
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,468
- No.
<i>- Follow me!</i>

28
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:05,440
- You'll die for this.
- No, wait, it wasn't her!

29
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:20,121
- You'll-.
- No, wa-

30
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:52,287
We've got to leave.

31
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:54,622
They'll hang you
for this.

32
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:57,759
<i>- Inside the King's tent, go!</i>
- Now!

33
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:00,829
I won't leave him.

34
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:05,234
You can't avenge him
if you're dead.

35
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,504
<i>Over there, go!</i>

36
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:10,773
Not that way.

37
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:47,078
We need to go home.

38
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:50,114
- Loras.
- My Lord, My Lady.

39
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:51,649
Get out.

40
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,851
Stannis will be here
in an hour.

41
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,654
When he arrives, Renly's
bannermen will flock to him.

42
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:58,890
<i>Your former companions</i>
<i>will fight for the privilege</i>

43
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:01,425
of selling you
to their new king.

44
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,327
And you want that
privilege for yourself.

45
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,764
You will note that I am
standing here talking to you,

46
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,967
- not Stannis.
- There's no time for this.

47
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,469
Ride back to
Highgarden, sister.

48
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,571
I'm not running
from Stannis.

49
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,840
<i>Brienne of Tarth</i>
<i>murdered Renly.</i>

50
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,176
I don't believe that.
You don't believe that.

51
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,280
Who gained the most
from our king's death?

52
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,282
Stannis.

53
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,216
I will put a sword
through his righteous face.

54
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,519
You can't stay here.

55
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,188
He would have been
a true king,

56
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,524
a good king.

57
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,393
<i>Tell me, Ser Loras,</i>

58
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,029
what do you desire
most in this world?

59
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,897
Revenge.

60
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,566
I have always found that to
be the purest of motivations,

61
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,136
but you won't have a chance to
put your sword through Stannis,

62
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,737
<i>not today.</i>

63
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,972
<i>You'll be cut to pieces before</i>
<i>he sets foot on solid ground.</i>

64
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:51,241
If it is justice
that you want,

65
00:06:51,275 --> 00:06:52,708
be smart about it.

66
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:55,244
You can't avenge him
from the grave.

67
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:59,348
Bring the horses.

68
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:03,553
Please.

69
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,453
He was very handsome.

70
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,021
He was, Your Grace.

71
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,190
"Your Grace."

72
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,127
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

73
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,463
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

74
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,899
Do you want to be a queen?

75
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:51,035
No.

76
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:54,871
I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

77
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,688
Killed?
By whom?

78
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,290
<i>Accounts differ.</i>

79
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,026
Most seem to implicate
Catelyn Stark in some way.

80
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,828
Really?
Who'd have thought?

81
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,029
Some say it was one
of his own Kingsguard,

82
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,965
while still others say it was
Stannis himself who did it

83
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,967
after negotiations
went sour.

84
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,035
Whomever did it,
I say well done.

85
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,503
It's not what Varys says.

86
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,173
He says Renly's army is
<i>flocking to support Stannis,</i>

87
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:32,143
which would give Stannis superiority
over us on both land and sea.

88
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,678
Littlefinger says we can
outspend him three to one.

89
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,548
And I say father raised you to
have too much respect for money.

90
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,950
<i>Stannis Baratheon</i>
<i>is coming for us,</i>

91
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,385
sooner rather than later.

92
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,787
Aren't there other things
you should be doing,

93
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,056
like sealing my daughter in a crate
so you can ship her away?

94
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,428
She'll be safer in Dorne.

95
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,160
Yes, I know how concerned
you are for her safety.

96
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:49,995
It so happens that I am.

97
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,764
Myrcella is a sweet,
innocent girl

98
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,699
and I don't blame her
at all for you.

99
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,335
So clever.

100
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,838
Aren't you
always so clever

101
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,140
with your schemes
and your plots?

102
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,209
Schemes and plots
are the same thing.

103
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,245
They are going
to attack us.

104
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,879
We need to be ready.

105
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,381
No need to concern
yourself over it.

106
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,751
The King is taking personal
charge of siege preparations.

107
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,421
May I ask specifically
what the King has in mind?

108
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,891
You may specifically
or you may ask vaguely.

109
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:22,159
The answer will be
the same.

110
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:30,635
It's important
that we talk about this.

111
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,541
It's the King's
royal prerogative

112
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,512
to withhold sensitive information
from his councilors.

113
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,190
<i>It's wildfire.</i>

114
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:51,959
Wildfire?

115
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:56,064
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you, cousin?

116
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,833
- No.
- That's a lie right there.

117
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,035
It is not a lie.
Why would I lie?

118
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,337
Tell me,

119
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,073
if the vile allegations

120
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:07,642
against my brother
and sister are true,

121
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:10,044
do you think it will
make Jaime more likely

122
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:12,413
to kill you or less likely?

123
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:15,134
When I tell him
you're fucking her, I mean.

124
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,917
I'm telling you the truth.

125
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:18,470
The smart money
would be on more likely.

126
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,053
She's making wildfire.

127
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,689
But then perhaps his own unnatural
urges will give him sympathy for yours.

128
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,157
The alchemists' guild
is being commissioned.

129
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,892
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

130
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,527
They have thousands of pots
already stored in their vaults.

131
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,696
They are planning to launch
them from the city walls

132
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,531
into Stannis's ships
and armies.

133
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,200
<i>Please.</i>

134
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,102
When did she
tell you this?

135
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,607
I heard her talking
with the Pyromancer.

136
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,478
And the other night
after I left her,

137
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,781
she went to meet him.

138
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,751
- I swear to you.
- Swear to me on what?

139
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:53,521
- On my life.
- But I don't care about your life.

140
00:10:53,555 --> 00:10:55,557
In the Light of the Seven,

141
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,592
by all that is
holy and right,

142
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:00,094
I, Lancel Lannister,
do solemnly vow--

143
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:01,524
All right, all right.
Enough.

144
00:11:01,549 --> 00:11:03,549
Even torturing
you is boring.

145
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:06,500
<i>Just get out.</i>

146
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,103
Oh, Lancel,
tell my friend Bronn

147
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,140
to please kill you if anything
should happen to me.

148
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,242
Please kill me if anything
should happen to Lord Tyrion.

149
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,546
It will be my pleasure.

150
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,152
- Your Grace.
- What is it?

151
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,006
Your Grace.

152
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:30,988
I'm sorry about
your brother, Your Grace.

153
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,468
I wanted to let you know
that people grieve for him.

154
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,124
Your Grace.

155
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,926
- Fools love a fool.
- Your Grace.

156
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,596
I grieve for him as well--
for the boy he was,

157
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,265
not the man
he grew to be.

158
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,434
I need to speak to you about
what I saw in that cave.

159
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,030
I thought I made it clear
to you there'd be no need to

160
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:45,147
speak to me on this matter.

161
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:45,977
Your Grace, I--

162
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:48,002
I've never known you to
need to hear a thing twice.

163
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,211
And I've never known you
to hide from the truth.

164
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:53,747
You've come to lecture
me on truth?

165
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,482
I've come to tell you
that what I saw--

166
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,617
All my brother's bannermen
have come to my side.

167
00:11:59,487 --> 00:12:02,688
Except the Tyrells,
who fled like cowards.

168
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,523
They won't be able
to resist us now.

169
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,425
Soon I shall be sitting
on the Iron Throne.

170
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,293
Nothing is worth
what this will cost you,

171
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,762
- not even the Iron--
- I'll hear no more about it.

172
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>Take a company of men,</i>
<i>secure the perimeter.</i>

173
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,943
When do we sail
for King's Landing?

174
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,379
As soon as I've
consolidated my troops.

175
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,281
We'll make short work
of the Lannisters' fleet.

176
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:30,350
Once Blackwater Bay
is cleared,

177
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:33,487
we'll deliver our troops to their
doorstep and take the city.

178
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:37,224
And will you bring
Lady Melisandre with you?

179
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,327
That's not your concern.

180
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,830
If you take King's Landing with her
by your side, the victory will be hers.

181
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:46,232
I never thought I'd have reason to
doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

182
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,168
Loyal service means
telling hard truths.

183
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,537
Oh, truth again.

184
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,673
All right,
what's the truth?

185
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,642
The hard truth?

186
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,611
<i>She's a foreigner</i>

187
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,746
preaching her
foreign religion.

188
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,017
Some believe she whispers orders
in your ear and you obey.

189
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,722
What do you believe?

190
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:16,797
You won those bannermen
from Renly.

191
00:13:16,832 --> 00:13:18,899
Don't lose them to her.

192
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:26,673
We set out for King's Landing
without Lady Melisandre.

193
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,344
And you lead the fleet
into Blackwater Bay.

194
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,913
Your Grace, I'm honored,
but my time on the sea

195
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,582
was spent evading ships,
not attacking them.

196
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,383
The other lords
won't be happy.

197
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,453
Most of those lords should
consider themselves lucky

198
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,555
I don't hang them
for treason.

199
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:50,194
Hard truths cut
both ways, Ser Davos.

200
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:07,144
<i>I've got it!</i>
<i>I've got it!</i>

201
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,282
<i>So it's that one there</i>
<i>at the top, on the right.</i>

202
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,453
Buy my fruit, My Lord.
Fresh fruit.

203
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,288
Stannis has more infantry,

204
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,190
more ships, more horses.

205
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,926
What do we have?

206
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,495
There's that mind of yours
you keep going on about.

207
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,865
Well, I've never actually been
able to kill people with it.

208
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,768
Good thing.
I'd be out of a job.

209
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,037
<i>What about your father?</i>

210
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,407
He hasn't sent
a raven in weeks.

211
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,009
He's very busy.

212
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,912
Being repeatedly humiliated by
Robb Stark is time-consuming.

213
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,314
We won't be able to hold
the city against Stannis,

214
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,183
not the way Joffrey's
planning on holding it.

215
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,385
Corruption, yes.

216
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:53,322
We are swollen,
bloated, foul.

217
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:56,726
Brother fornicates with sister
in the bed of Kings

218
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,662
and we're surprised when the
fruit of their incest is rotten?

219
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,833
Yes, a rotten king.

220
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:06,369
It's hard to argue
with his assessment.

221
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:09,005
Not after what he did
to your birthday present.

222
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,741
The King is a lost cause.

223
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:14,010
It's the rest of us
I'm worried about now.

224
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:17,881
A dancing king, prancing
down his bloodstained halls

225
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,818
to the tune of a twisted
demon monkey.

226
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:25,889
You have to admire
his imagination.

227
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:29,292
- He's talking about you.
- What?

228
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,261
Demon monkey?

229
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,397
People think you're pulling
the King's strings.

230
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,633
They blame you
for the city's ills.

231
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,502
Blame me?
I'm trying to save them.

232
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:41,538
You don't need
to convince me.

233
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,141
Demon monkey.

234
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,343
<i>( Seagulls screeching</i>

235
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,839
Yeah, come on.

236
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,441
You're the crew
of the sea bitch?

237
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,211
I'm your commander.
Welcome.

238
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,848
Stop.

239
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,183
Stop!

240
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,386
Your Captain commands
you to stop.

241
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,423
Where are we
heading, Captain?

242
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:37,227
The Stony Shore
to raid their villages.

243
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,630
<i>There'll be spoils</i>
<i>in it for you, and women,</i>

244
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,199
if you do your jobs well.

245
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,503
And who decides if we've
done our jobs well?

246
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,973
I do.

247
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,042
Your Captain.

248
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,581
I have been reaving
and raping

249
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:58,652
since before you left
Balon's balls, Captain.

250
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:02,823
Don't reckon I've got much use
for your ideas on how to do it.

251
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:06,293
Don't reckon I've got
much use for a captain at all.

252
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:10,331
I'm thinking I can do the job
of captain real well myself.

253
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:12,466
All I need is a ship.

254
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,722
You wouldn't know
where I could find myself

255
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:16,747
a ship now, would you?

256
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,609
You could do that,

257
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:25,011
take the ship,
head out on your own.

258
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,485
And I will hunt you down,
drag you back here in chains,

259
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,048
and hang you for a traitor.

260
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,651
Stop. We yield.

261
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,857
Congratulations
on your first command.

262
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,627
Thank you. Kind of you
to come see me off.

263
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,128
Oh, I'm not here
for you.

264
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:45,164
I was just on my way
to Red Harbor.

265
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:48,969
I've got 30 ships. There's
nowhere to put them here.

266
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:52,271
- Too narrow.
- You'd better get out there.

267
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,340
Wouldn't want them
to set sail without you.

268
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,242
That would never happen.

269
00:17:56,277 --> 00:18:00,279
My crew would wait on deck
for a year if I asked them to.

270
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:02,815
This lot, though...

271
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:07,053
Enjoy the Stony Shore.

272
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,026
Come on,
I'll take you out.

273
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:15,862
Who are you?

274
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,964
Dagmer, your first mate.

275
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,268
Why aren't you with
the rest of them?

276
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:25,372
Or did they send you to row me
out and dump me halfway in the sea?

277
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:26,807
That would be good
for a laugh.

278
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:29,710
They're not gonna respect you
until you prove yourself.

279
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,571
And how am I supposed
to prove myself by pillaging

280
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:33,181
piss-poor fishing villages?

281
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:35,249
You're not.

282
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:37,452
And yet that's the task
my father has given me

283
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:40,855
to prove that
I'm a true Iron Islander.

284
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:43,157
<i>They're all Iron Islanders.</i>

285
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:46,661
Do they do as they're told
or do they do as they like?

286
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:56,670
The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

287
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:59,340
The seat of the House
of Tallhart--

288
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:02,276
a more impressive prize than
a few fishermen's daughters.

289
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,570
What, you don't think
we could take it?

290
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:06,748
No, we could.

291
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:08,951
We could never hold it
for more than a few days.

292
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:11,353
As soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

293
00:19:11,388 --> 00:19:14,190
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

294
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:18,361
And then--

295
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,735
take me to my ship.

296
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:32,875
The Starks have
overextended their lines.

297
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,977
Now that summer's over,
they'll have a hard time

298
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:37,079
keeping their men
and horses fed.

299
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:39,215
The Starks understand winter
better than we ever will.

300
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,951
The cold won't beat them.

301
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:45,589
Our spies report growing
discontent among the northern lords.

302
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:47,123
They want to return home

303
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,792
and gather the harvest
before the crops turn.

304
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:53,232
And I'm sure if those same spies
snuck into our own encampments,

305
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:56,436
they would report growing discontent
amongst the southern lords.

306
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,338
This is war;
No one's content.

307
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:04,310
We've underestimated
the Stark boy for too long.

308
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:07,680
He has a good mind for warfare,
his men worship him.

309
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,816
And as long as he keeps
winning battles,

310
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,753
they'll keep believing
he is King in the North.

311
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:15,422
You've been waiting
for him to fail.

312
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:17,991
He is not going to fail,

313
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,994
not without our help.

314
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:24,664
So how do we stop him?

315
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:27,067
<i>We've worked through</i>
<i>the night, My Lord.</i>

316
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,402
Perhaps we'd profit
from some sleep.

317
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,471
As I think
you would, Reginald.

318
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:33,073
And because
you're my cousin,

319
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,842
I might even let you
wake from that sleep.

320
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,413
Go, I'm sure your wife
must miss you.

321
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,181
My wife's in Lannisport.

322
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:43,417
Well, then you'd
better start riding.

323
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:48,456
Go before I change my mind
and send her your head.

324
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,858
If your name
wasn't Lannister,

325
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:54,462
you'd be scrubbing out pots
in the cook's tent. Go!

326
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,000
Not wine, water.

327
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:01,202
We'll be here
for some time.

328
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,843
Girl.

329
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:10,879
Where are you from?

330
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,781
Maidenpool, My Lord.

331
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:16,185
And who are the Lords
of Maidenpool?

332
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:20,089
- Remind me.
- House Mooton, My Lord.

333
00:21:20,124 --> 00:21:22,158
And what is their Sigil?

334
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:28,098
A red salmon.

335
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:31,268
I think a Maidenpool girl
would remember that.

336
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,405
You're a northerner,
aren't you?

337
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:38,675
Good. One more time,
where are you from?

338
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,678
Barrowton, My Lord.
House Dustin.

339
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:45,783
Two crossed longaxes
beneath a black crown.

340
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:51,355
And what do they say
of Robb Stark in the North?

341
00:21:53,691 --> 00:21:56,326
They call him
the young wolf.

342
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:58,796
And?

343
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:01,632
They say he rides into battle on
the back of a giant Direwolf.

344
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:07,939
They say he can turn into
a wolf himself when he wants.

345
00:22:07,974 --> 00:22:09,942
They say he can't be killed.

346
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,879
And do you believe them?

347
00:22:13,981 --> 00:22:16,783
No, My Lord.

348
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,952
Anyone can be killed.

349
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:28,295
Fetch that water.

350
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,439
A girl says nothing.

351
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,310
A girl keeps
her mouth closed.

352
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:18,980
<i>No one hears,</i>

353
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:22,884
and friends may talk
in secret, yes?

354
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:28,690
A boy becomes a girl.

355
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:30,326
I was always a girl.

356
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,562
And I was always aware.

357
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:35,298
But the girl
keeps secrets.

358
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:38,334
<i>It is not for a man</i>
<i>to spoil them.</i>

359
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,971
You're one of them now.

360
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,175
I should have let you burn.

361
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:51,745
And you fetch water
for one of them now.

362
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,815
Why is this right for you
and wrong for me?

363
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,551
I didn't have a choice.

364
00:23:57,585 --> 00:24:01,655
You did.
I did.

365
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,324
And here we are.

366
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,362
A man pays his debts.

367
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:10,731
A man owes three.

368
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:12,032
Three what?

369
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:16,504
The Red God takes
what is his, lovely girl.

370
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,607
And only death
may pay for life.

371
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:23,244
You saved me
and the two I was with.

372
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,181
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

373
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:31,920
We have to give them back.

374
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:37,258
Speak three names

375
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,861
and the man
will do the rest.

376
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:43,598
Three lives
I will give you--

377
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:46,968
no more, no less,
and we're done.

378
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:49,503
I can name anyone

379
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,839
and you'll kill him?

380
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,543
A man has said.

381
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,113
The one who
tortures everyone.

382
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:00,847
A man needs a name.

383
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,216
I don't know his name.

384
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,252
They call him
the Tickler.

385
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,453
That is enough.

386
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:11,590
Go now, girl.
Your master is thirsty.

387
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,371
<i>He's not here yet.</i>

388
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:28,841
He'd have seen us,
blown the horn.

389
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,043
When will he come?

390
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:33,079
The Halfhand does things
in his own time.

391
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:35,381
My uncle told me
stories about him.

392
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,450
Most of them are true.

393
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:40,153
I heard the Halfhand spent half
of last winter beyond the wall.

394
00:25:40,187 --> 00:25:41,721
The whole winter.

395
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:44,423
He was north of the Skirling Pass
when the snows came.

396
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,125
Had to wait for the thaw.

397
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,128
So it is possible for someone
to survive out here on their own.

398
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:53,565
Well, possible
for the Halfhand.

399
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,400
Beautiful, isn't it?

400
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,968
Gilly would love it here.

401
00:25:58,003 --> 00:26:01,605
There's nothing more sickening
than a man in love.

402
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:31,333
<i>About time you did something.</i>

403
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:34,135
<i>At least you'll keep warm.</i>

404
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:38,373
The fist
of the First Men.

405
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:41,911
Think of how old
this place is--

406
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:44,514
before the Targaryens
defeated the Hendals,

407
00:26:44,548 --> 00:26:47,317
before the Andals took
Westeros from the First Men.

408
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:50,520
Before I die, please,
stop talking.

409
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:52,790
Thousands and thousands
of years ago,

410
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,894
the First Men stood here
where we're standing

411
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:58,229
all through the long night.

412
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,700
What do you think they
were like, the First Men?

413
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,335
Stupid.

414
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,539
Smart people don't find
themselves in places like this.

415
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:10,108
I think
they were afraid.

416
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:14,179
I think they came here
to get away from something.

417
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:17,749
And I don't think
it worked.

418
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,221
Wildlings?

419
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,959
One blast is for rangers returning.

420
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,661
Wildlings is two blasts.

421
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:33,164
So you got to stand
there waiting,

422
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:35,265
<i>wondering.</i>

423
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,934
<i>One blast for friends,</i>

424
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:39,871
<i>two for foes.</i>

425
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:47,212
And three
for White Walkers.

426
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:49,148
It's been 1,000 years,

427
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:51,918
but that's the only time
they blow the horn three times.

428
00:27:51,952 --> 00:27:55,054
But if it's been 1,000 years,
how do you know?

429
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:58,790
- Well...
- I read it in a book.

430
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:00,926
Look.

431
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:04,228
It's Qhorin Halfhand.

432
00:28:04,263 --> 00:28:07,465
Aye, we'll live
another day.

433
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:10,067
Hurrah.

434
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,279
Take care, My Lord.

435
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:25,282
I remember reading
an old sailor's proverb--

436
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:28,252
"piss on wildfire
and your cock burns off."

437
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:31,923
Oh, I have not conducted
this experiment.

438
00:28:31,957 --> 00:28:34,559
It could well be true.

439
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:36,428
The substance
burns so hot,

440
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:39,597
it melts wood,
stone, even steel,

441
00:28:39,632 --> 00:28:42,934
and, of course, flesh.

442
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:47,471
The substance burns so hot,
it melts flesh like tallow.

443
00:28:50,808 --> 00:28:54,144
After the dragons died,
wildfire was the key

444
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:55,946
to the Targaryen power.

445
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,016
My companion takes issue.

446
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,385
If I could tell you
how many crazy old men

447
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,554
I've seen pushing carts
around army camps

448
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:07,291
making grand claims about
jars full of pig shit...

449
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:10,561
- No offense meant.
- Our order does not deal in pig shit.

450
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:13,297
The substance
is fire given form.

451
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:16,900
And we have been perfecting it
since the days of Maegor.

452
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,268
To do what?

453
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:21,705
The jars are put in catapults
and flung at the enemy.

454
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:24,407
How much do you have?

455
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:31,079
If you could get real soldiers
to man the catapults,

456
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:34,481
then maybe you'd hit
your target one time in 10,

457
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:37,650
but all the real soldiers are in
the Riverlands with your father.

458
00:29:37,684 --> 00:29:40,319
My Lord, this man
is insulting.

459
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:42,655
I don't know if you've
ever seen a battle, old man,

460
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,324
but things can get
a bit messy.

461
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:45,725
'Cause when we're flinging
things at Stannis,

462
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,527
he's flinging them
right back at us.

463
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:50,396
Men die, men shit
themselves, men run,

464
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,164
which means
pots falling,

465
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:54,099
which means fire
inside the walls,

466
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:56,400
which means the poor cunts
trying to defend the city

467
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:58,425
end up burning it down.

468
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:01,005
My friend remains
unconvinced.

469
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,374
He would not dare
insult my order

470
00:30:03,408 --> 00:30:05,108
whilst Aerys Targaryen
lived.

471
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:07,744
Well, he's not
living anymore.

472
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:10,880
And all his pots of wildfire
didn't help him, did they?

473
00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:14,884
Men win wars,
not magic tricks.

474
00:30:30,198 --> 00:30:34,467
We have been working
tirelessly day and night

475
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:38,971
ever since your royal sister
commanded us to do so.

476
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,140
Our present count stands

477
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:44,676
at 7,811,

478
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,179
enough to burn Stannis
Baratheon's fleet

479
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,314
and armies both.

480
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,050
This is a shit idea.

481
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,953
I'm afraid I have to concur
with my advisor, wisdom Hallyne.

482
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:01,224
The contents of this room
could lay King's Landing low.

483
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,595
You won't be making wildfire
for my sister any longer.

484
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:10,833
You'll be making it
for me.

485
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,978
Dracarys.

486
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,955
Dracarys.

487
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,402
He'll be able to feed
himself from now on.

488
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,307
<i>Let him sleep, Doreah.</i>

489
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,111
Yes, Khaleesi.

490
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,282
He loves you.

491
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,363
Thank you, my friend.

492
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:15,535
Did you see the dress
Xaro had made for you?

493
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:18,604
They say he's the
wealthiest man in Qarth.

494
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:20,873
It is known.

495
00:32:20,908 --> 00:32:23,910
And if Qarth is the wealthiest
city in Essos--

496
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:25,845
The last time a rich man
gave me a dress,

497
00:32:25,879 --> 00:32:28,614
he was selling me
to Khal Drogo.

498
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:37,990
Xaro is our host,
but we know nothing about him.

499
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,793
Men like to talk
about other men

500
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:42,829
when they're happy.

501
00:32:50,371 --> 00:32:52,472
You would look like
a real princess in Xaro's--

502
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:55,543
She's not a princess.
She's a Khaleesi.

503
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,817
You should wear it,
Khaleesi.

504
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:05,318
You are their guest.

505
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,954
It would be rude not to.

506
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:30,177
And you must visit
the night market.

507
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:35,049
The Qartheen night market is like
no night market you've ever seen.

508
00:33:35,084 --> 00:33:36,952
It sounds wonderful.

509
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:38,954
The Meereens think
they have a night market.

510
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:41,256
I will take you
there myself.

511
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,726
Please excuse me
for a moment.

512
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,465
What are they doing?

513
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:53,235
Malakko says the statue
is too heavy to carry.

514
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,604
Kovarro says that
Malakko is an idiot.

515
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:57,340
<i>They can pry out the gems,</i>
<i>the rest is pure gold.</i>

516
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:00,977
Very soft. He can chop off
as much as we can carry.

517
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,508
My brother used to say the only
thing the Dothraki knew how to do

518
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,577
was steal things
better men have built.

519
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:35,312
It's not the only thing.

520
00:34:35,346 --> 00:34:37,147
They're quite good
at killing the better men.

521
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:40,183
That's not the kind of queen
I'm going to be.

522
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:43,086
Mother of Dragons.

523
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,322
On behalf of the warlocks
of Qarth,

524
00:34:45,356 --> 00:34:47,457
I welcome you.

525
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:50,693
A demonstration?

526
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:55,832
Take this gem.
Look at it.

527
00:34:57,201 --> 00:34:59,602
Into its depths.

528
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:01,971
So many facets.

529
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:06,142
Look closely enough and you
can see yourself in them.

530
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:10,646
Often more than once.

531
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:17,519
Should you grow tired of
Xaro's baubles and trinkets,

532
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:20,889
it would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying.

533
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:23,358
You're always welcome,

534
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:26,061
Mother of Dragons.

535
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:34,937
My apologies.

536
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:37,539
Pyat Pree is one
of the Thirteen.

537
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:39,975
It was customary for me
to extend him an invitation.

538
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:43,144
Customs die
slow deaths in Qarth.

539
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:45,946
What is the House
of the Undying?

540
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:49,583
It is where the warlocks go
to squint at dusty books

541
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:51,184
and drink shade
of the evening.

542
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:55,288
It turns their lips blue
and their minds soft--

543
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:58,190
so soft,
they actually believe

544
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:00,225
their parlor tricks
are magic.

545
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:06,532
<i>You watch over her.</i>

546
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:10,103
Do I know you?

547
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:12,039
I know you.

548
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:15,609
Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

549
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:17,378
Who are you?

550
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:19,714
I'm no one.

551
00:36:19,748 --> 00:36:21,716
But she is
the Mother of Dragons.

552
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,353
She needs true protectors
now more than ever.

553
00:36:25,387 --> 00:36:27,355
They shall come
day and night

554
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:29,891
to see the wonder born
into the world again.

555
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:33,429
And when they see,
they shall lust,

556
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:37,266
for dragons are fire
made flesh.

557
00:36:37,301 --> 00:36:39,902
And fire is power.

558
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:52,481
It looked like Stannis.

559
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:55,950
To me it just
looked like...

560
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:02,057
A shadow in
the shape of a man.

561
00:37:02,091 --> 00:37:04,126
In the shape
of Stannis.

562
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:11,201
We should reach
my son's camp tomorrow.

563
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:13,336
Will you stay there
long, My Lady?

564
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:17,040
Only long enough to tell
Robb what I have seen.

565
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:20,377
After that, I will leave
for Winterfell.

566
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:23,713
My two youngest need me.

567
00:37:23,747 --> 00:37:26,882
I've been away from them
for far too long.

568
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,818
I never knew my mother.

569
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:32,353
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:36,090
My own mother died
on the birthing bed

571
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:38,959
when I was very young.

572
00:37:42,197 --> 00:37:44,732
It's a bloody business.

573
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:48,302
What comes after
is even harder.

574
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:53,107
Once you're safely back
amongst your own people,

575
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:56,277
will you give me leave
to go, My Lady?

576
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,513
You mean to kill Stannis.

577
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:00,181
I swore a vow.

578
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:03,484
But Stannis has
a great army around him.

579
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:06,020
His own guards are sworn
to keep him safe.

580
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:07,921
<i>I'm as good</i>
<i>as any of them.</i>

581
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:10,824
I should never have fled.

582
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:14,594
Renly's death
was no fault of yours.

583
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:16,462
You served him bravely.

584
00:38:16,497 --> 00:38:20,501
I only held him
that once

585
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:23,170
as he was dying.

586
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,274
He's gone, Brienne.

587
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:31,913
You serve nothing and no one
by following him into the earth.

588
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:36,285
Renly's enemies are
Robb's enemies as well.

589
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:42,958
I do not know
your son, My Lady...

590
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:49,130
but I could serve you
if you would have me.

591
00:38:49,164 --> 00:38:51,232
<i>You have courage.</i>

592
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:53,734
Not battle courage, perhaps,

593
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:57,204
but, I don't know,

594
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,139
a woman's kind of courage.

595
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:01,676
<i>And I think that</i>
<i>when the time comes,</i>

596
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,177
<i>you will not hold me back.</i>

597
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:05,914
Promise me that you
will not hold me back

598
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:08,283
from Stannis.

599
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:16,158
When the time comes,
I will not hold you back.

600
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:25,100
Then I am yours,
My Lady.

601
00:39:26,202 --> 00:39:27,703
I will shield your back

602
00:39:27,737 --> 00:39:30,806
and give my life for yours
if it comes to that.

603
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,442
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

604
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:44,954
I vow that you shall always
have a place in my home

605
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,956
and at my table

606
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,425
and that I shall ask
no service of you

607
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,028
that might
bring you dishonor.

608
00:39:52,062 --> 00:39:55,131
I swear it by the Old Gods
and the new.

609
00:39:58,402 --> 00:40:00,602
<i>And it's not</i>
<i>just thieves, My Lord.</i>

610
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:03,807
<i>There's wolves</i>
<i>in them hills now,</i>

611
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:06,142
more than I've ever seen.

612
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:09,213
They come down in the night
and they kill my sheep.

613
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:13,083
My three sons is away fighting
for your brother, My Lord.

614
00:40:13,117 --> 00:40:15,318
They'll fight,
keep fighting

615
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:17,487
till they're told
to go home.

616
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:20,123
I have no one to man
my flock now. Only me.

617
00:40:20,157 --> 00:40:23,792
I can't keep watch
all day and all night.

618
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:28,630
We can send two orphan boys
from Winterstown home with you

619
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:30,398
to help watch over
your flock

620
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:32,233
if you can give them
room and board.

621
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:34,969
My wife always prayed
for more children.

622
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:37,371
We'll look after them.
Thank you, My Lord.

623
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:40,742
And may the Gods
bless you and yours.

624
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:45,748
Stop it.

625
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:49,085
If that's everyone, I'm going
to go for a ride before dark.

626
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,121
- Good.
- Hodor.

627
00:40:51,155 --> 00:40:55,092
- Hodor.
Bran-- Lord Stark.

628
00:40:55,127 --> 00:40:56,861
Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

629
00:40:56,895 --> 00:40:59,563
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

630
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:02,666
<i>How can the Lannisters</i>
<i>strike so far north?</i>

631
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,302
Might be a raiding party
led by the Mountain.

632
00:41:05,336 --> 00:41:07,837
Might be Sellswords
paid by Tywin Lannister.

633
00:41:07,872 --> 00:41:09,105
We have to help them.

634
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,640
Most of the fighting men
are away with Robb,

635
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:12,375
but I can gather
200 decent men.

636
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,636
Do you need so many?

637
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:15,178
If we can't protect
our own bannermen,

638
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,981
why should
they protect us?

639
00:41:18,015 --> 00:41:20,784
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

640
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:22,286
Won't take long, My Lord.

641
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,121
Southerners don't
do well up here.

642
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:37,069
So, what does it mean?

643
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,145
Ask your Maester Luwin.

644
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,324
He's the one studying
books all the time.

645
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:43,809
I did ask him. He'd never
heard of a three-eyed raven.

646
00:41:43,843 --> 00:41:47,446
- Must not mean anything, then
- You're lying.

647
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,248
You might be a little lord,
but don't you call me a liar.

648
00:41:50,282 --> 00:41:53,518
- You know what it means.
- I never said I didn't.

649
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,486
You didn't give me
an honest answer.

650
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:58,523
That's not the same
as being a liar.

651
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,158
Well, it's not far off.

652
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:04,296
So, you've been dreaming
of a three-eyed raven again?

653
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:09,034
In the Godswood,
you told me you didn't dream.

654
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,103
Now who's a liar?

655
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:16,909
What did you see
in your dream?

656
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:21,614
Something bad?

657
00:42:21,648 --> 00:42:23,849
Tell me, boy.

658
00:42:27,187 --> 00:42:30,122
I dreamt that the sea
came to Winterfell.

659
00:42:31,558 --> 00:42:34,025
I saw waves crashing
against the gates

660
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,762
and the water came
flowing over the walls...

661
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,601
<i>flooded the castle.</i>

662
00:42:44,804 --> 00:42:47,005
Drowned men
were floating here

663
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,174
in the yard.

664
00:42:51,744 --> 00:42:54,780
Ser Rodrik
was one of them.

665
00:42:56,816 --> 00:42:59,518
The sea is hundreds
of miles away.

666
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:01,167
I know.

667
00:43:01,168 --> 00:43:02,493
It's just a stupid dream.

668
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:04,389
I've got to get these
potatoes to the kitchen.

669
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,891
Otherwise they'll put me
in chains again.

670
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:08,327
Osha.

671
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:10,830
The three-eyed raven,

672
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:13,333
what do they say about it

673
00:43:13,368 --> 00:43:16,169
north of the wall?

674
00:43:16,204 --> 00:43:19,506
They say all sorts of crazy
things north of the wall.

675
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,053
- There.
<i>- Where?</i>

676
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:34,854
On that Mountain.

677
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:37,356
I don't see very well.

678
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:38,991
A fire.

679
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:44,264
There's a fire.

680
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:47,434
<i>The people sitting around it have</i>
<i>better eyes than yours or mine.</i>

681
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:50,537
When they see us coming,
that fire becomes a signal.

682
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:54,141
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time.
to throw a party in our honor.

683
00:43:54,176 --> 00:43:56,244
How many wildlings
have joined him?

684
00:43:56,278 --> 00:44:00,447
From what we can tell,
all of them.

685
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:07,454
<i>Mance has gathered them all</i>
<i>like deer against the wolves.</i>

686
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:09,490
<i>They're almost ready</i>
<i>to make their move.</i>

687
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:11,458
Where?

688
00:44:11,492 --> 00:44:13,327
Somewhere safe.

689
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:15,195
Somewhere south.

690
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:18,164
<i>Can't just march</i>
<i>into their midst.</i>

691
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,985
And we can't wait for them
here with nothing but a pile

692
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,835
of stones to protect us.

693
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:24,772
You saying we should
fall back to the Wall?

694
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:28,209
Mance was one of us once.

695
00:44:28,244 --> 00:44:30,645
Now he's one of them.

696
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,415
He's gonna teach them
our way of doing things.

697
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,351
They'll hit us in force.

698
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:37,788
And they won't run away
when we hit back.

699
00:44:37,822 --> 00:44:40,257
<i>They're gonna be more</i>
<i>organized than before,</i>

700
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:42,192
<i>more disciplined</i>

701
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:44,261
more like us.

702
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:46,897
So we need to be
more like them,

703
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:48,832
do things their way.

704
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:52,035
Sneak in, kill Mance,

705
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:53,670
and scatter them
to the winds

706
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:55,738
before they can march
on the Wall.

707
00:44:55,772 --> 00:44:56,619
And to do that...

708
00:44:56,644 --> 00:44:58,636
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

709
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:00,610
It's not a job
for 400 men.

710
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:04,347
I need to move fast
and silent.

711
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:08,084
Harker, Stonesnake,
Borba.

712
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,521
Lord Commander, I'd like
to join Lord Qhorin.

713
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:14,157
I've been called
lots of things,

714
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,079
but that might be
my first Lord Qhorin.

715
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,429
You're a steward,
Snow, not a ranger.

716
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:21,698
I've fought
and killed a Wight.

717
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:23,934
How many rangers
can say that?

718
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:26,003
He's the one?

719
00:45:27,105 --> 00:45:29,506
Aye.
You killed a Wight.

720
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,408
You also let an old man

721
00:45:31,443 --> 00:45:34,278
beat you bloody
and take your sword.

722
00:45:34,312 --> 00:45:36,647
<i>Craster?</i>

723
00:45:36,681 --> 00:45:39,683
In the boy's defense,
that's a tough old goat.

724
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,422
I could take up Jon's duties
while he's gone, My Lord.

725
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:48,091
It would be no trouble.

726
00:45:56,133 --> 00:45:59,536
Well, I hope you make
a better ranger

727
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,905
than you do a steward.

728
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:05,308
Go on.

729
00:46:12,484 --> 00:46:14,319
<i>So, tell me,</i>

730
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:17,456
how long has your manservant
been in love with you?

731
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,193
He's not my manservant
and he's not in love with me.

732
00:46:21,227 --> 00:46:23,295
He's my advisor,

733
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,297
my friend.

734
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:26,866
Unlikely.

735
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,636
I can almost always tell
what a man wants.

736
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,005
And what about
what a woman wants?

737
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,107
Much more complicated.

738
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:36,176
You, for example,

739
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,779
what do you want?

740
00:46:38,813 --> 00:46:41,849
To cross the Narrow Sea
and take back the Iron Throne.

741
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,417
Why?

742
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:45,186
Because I promised
my Khalasar I'd protect them

743
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,622
and find them a safe home.

744
00:46:47,656 --> 00:46:51,260
You want to conquer
the Seven Kingdoms?

745
00:46:51,294 --> 00:46:52,962
I want them because
they're mine by right.

746
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:56,065
The Iron Throne is mine
and I will take it.

747
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,900
Ah, a conqueror.

748
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,069
And how did you get
all of this?

749
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:02,138
- Did someone give it to you?
- No.

750
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:03,672
I come from nothing.

751
00:47:03,707 --> 00:47:05,874
I hit the docks
like a piece of cargo,

752
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:08,510
except someone normally
cares what happens to cargo.

753
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:11,246
So you wanted more than
you had and you took it.

754
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,216
You're a conqueror, too.
you're just less ambitious.

755
00:47:16,952 --> 00:47:19,421
Mmm.

756
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:22,591
What do you want,
Xaro Zhoan Daxos?

757
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,327
At the gates of the city,
you bled for me.

758
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:28,364
Why?

759
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:30,733
I will show you why.

760
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:37,294
The door and the vault
is made of Valyrian stone.

761
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:41,278
The hardest steel
does not make a mark.

762
00:47:41,312 --> 00:47:44,681
I offered the greatest
locksmiths in Qarth

763
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:47,050
their weight in gold
if they could break into it.

764
00:47:47,084 --> 00:47:49,652
I made the same offer
to the greatest thieves.

765
00:47:49,686 --> 00:47:52,388
They all went home
empty-handed.

766
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:55,691
The only thing that
can open this door

767
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:57,859
is this key.

768
00:47:57,894 --> 00:47:59,328
And behind the door?

769
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,834
And it can all be mine?

770
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:06,536
All?

771
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:10,040
Let us say half.

772
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:14,312
More than enough to buy
horses, ships, armies--

773
00:48:14,347 --> 00:48:16,448
enough to go home.

774
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:19,385
All I have to do?

775
00:48:19,419 --> 00:48:20,753
Is marry me.

776
00:48:20,787 --> 00:48:23,889
That was a romantic proposal.

777
00:48:23,923 --> 00:48:26,258
I've already married
once for love,

778
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:29,028
but the Gods
stole her from me.

779
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:33,266
I come from nothing.

780
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,168
My mother and father
never owned a pair of shoes.

781
00:48:36,202 --> 00:48:39,338
But marry me and I will
give you the Seven Kingdoms

782
00:48:39,372 --> 00:48:43,109
and our children will be
Princes and Princesses.

783
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:47,379
See?

784
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:50,049
I have more ambition
than you thought.

785
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:53,627
The time is right,
Daenerys Targaryen,

786
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:55,652
first of your name.

787
00:48:56,023 --> 00:48:58,492
Robert Baratheon
is dead.

788
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,668
<i>If you cross the sea</i>
<i>with an army you bought--</i>

789
00:49:07,703 --> 00:49:09,971
The Seven Kingdoms are
at war with one another.

790
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:12,407
Four false kings
destroying the country.

791
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:15,744
To win Westeros, you need
support from Westeros.

792
00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:17,579
The usurper is dead.

793
00:49:17,614 --> 00:49:19,281
The Starks fight
the Lannisters,

794
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:21,216
and Baratheons
fight each other.

795
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,784
According to
your new friend

796
00:49:22,818 --> 00:49:24,552
who earned your trust
by cutting his hand?

797
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,455
The time to strike is now. We need
to find ships and an army

798
00:49:27,489 --> 00:49:29,379
or we'll spend the rest
of our lives rotting away

799
00:49:29,404 --> 00:49:30,425
at the edge of the world.

800
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,860
Rich men do not become rich
by giving more than they get.

801
00:49:32,894 --> 00:49:35,629
They'll give you ships and soldiers
and they'll own you forever.

802
00:49:35,664 --> 00:49:39,399
Moving carefully is the hard way,
but it's the right way.

803
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,867
And if I'd listened
to that advice

804
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:43,103
outside the gates of Qarth,
we'd all be dead by now.

805
00:49:43,137 --> 00:49:46,206
I know the opportunity before you
seems like the last you'll ever have,

806
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:46,947
but you must--

807
00:49:46,972 --> 00:49:48,972
Do not speak to me
like I'm a child.

808
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,748
- I only want--
- What do you want?

809
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:57,350
Tell me.

810
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:58,919
To see you
on the Iron Throne.

811
00:49:58,953 --> 00:50:01,688
- Why?
- You have a good claim.

812
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:04,524
A title.
A birthright.

813
00:50:04,558 --> 00:50:07,760
But you have something
more than that.

814
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:12,031
You may cover it up and deny it,
but you have a gentle heart.

815
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:14,567
You would not only
be respected and feared,

816
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:17,103
you would be loved.

817
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:19,271
Someone who can rule
and should rule.

818
00:50:19,306 --> 00:50:21,395
Centuries come and go
without a person like that

819
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,420
coming into the world.

820
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,677
There are times
when I look at you

821
00:50:25,711 --> 00:50:28,579
and still can't
believe you're real.

822
00:50:40,558 --> 00:50:43,894
So what would you
have me do as my advisor?

823
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:51,667
<i>Make your own way.</i>

824
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:54,503
Find your own ship.
You only need one.

825
00:50:54,537 --> 00:50:57,973
The allies we need
are in Westeros, not Qarth.

826
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:01,677
And how do I get
the ship?

827
00:51:01,711 --> 00:51:04,213
<i>I'll find it for you.</i>

828
00:51:04,247 --> 00:51:06,382
A sound ship
with a good captain.

829
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,691
I look forward
to meeting him.

830
00:51:17,962 --> 00:51:20,096
Khaleesi.

831
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:51,765
You should stand
sideface.

832
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:53,934
Sideface?

833
00:51:53,968 --> 00:51:56,070
Sideways.

834
00:51:56,104 --> 00:51:58,505
- Why?
- Smaller target.

835
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:03,677
Am I fighting someone?

836
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,079
You're practicing
for a fight.

837
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:08,715
You should practice right.

838
00:52:12,052 --> 00:52:13,987
Guards!

839
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:17,023
- Help.
- Did you see anything?

840
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:22,661
Go up there. Go and see where
he fell from.

841
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:28,366
Go up the back.

842
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,601
<i>That is strange.</i>

843
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,208
Move away.

844
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:44,314
<i>Stand back.</i>
<i>He's dead.</i>
