1
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,325
<i>That's it.</i>

2
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,785
The tide's against us.

3
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,387
Aye, but we have
the wind.

4
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,123
She'll blow us
straight to the gate.

5
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:36,591
You're coming home.

6
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:40,261
King's Landing hasn't
been home for 20 years.

7
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:45,133
I spent most of my life
dodging the Royal Fleet.

8
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:49,437
And now I'm sailing
right at them.

9
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:51,606
This is the Royal Fleet.

10
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,608
And you're not a smuggler anymore,
you're the high captain.

11
00:03:53,643 --> 00:03:56,878
Of course there are several
Royal Fleets at the moment.

12
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:59,481
Not after tonight.
When the sun rises,

13
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:01,549
Stannis will sit
on the Iron Throne

14
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:02,984
and you will be his Hand.

15
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,320
- Gods be good.
- God.

16
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:07,422
Father, there is only one
and he watches over us.

17
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,158
- But not over them?
- Over all of us.

18
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:12,258
The people of King's Landing
did not choose the false King

19
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:13,795
Joffrey Baratheon.

20
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,364
They will be glad to see
his head on a spike.

21
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,001
Well, first we have
to put it there.

22
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:21,570
Our ships outnumber
theirs 10 to one.

23
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,706
Our army outnumber
theirs five to one.

24
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,974
Those walls have
never been breached.

25
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:28,176
And the men
guarding the walls,

26
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,180
when they see you,
they don't see a liberator.

27
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:34,550
They see a stranger come
to set their city on fire.

28
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:37,285
I have faith
in the Lord of Light.

29
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,221
I have faith
in our cause.

30
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,391
And I have faith
in my captain.

31
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,362
Are you afraid, my lion?

32
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:28,536
If the city falls, Stannis will
burn every Lannister he can find.

33
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,673
Of course I'm afraid.

34
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,277
I won't let
them hurt you.

35
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:43,617
I'm a Lannister.

36
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:47,320
I don't have
a choice in all this.

37
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:49,456
But it's not your war.

38
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,697
It is now.

39
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,938
You can't fuck your way
out of everything.

40
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:08,109
I have so far.

41
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:14,316
Do you remember what you said
when you met me in your tent?

42
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:17,731
That I should make love
to you like it was your

43
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:19,656
last day on this earth.

44
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,833
<i>As you know, Your Grace,</i>

45
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,502
it is not only
the sworn duty of a Maester

46
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:40,907
to carry out the wishes
of the house he serves,

47
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,710
but also to offer guidance

48
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:46,980
and counsel
in times of war.

49
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:49,416
Your words are always
wise and measured.

50
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,919
- If you could--
- If anything,

51
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:56,024
a Maester's duties
become more urgent

52
00:06:56,058 --> 00:07:00,561
in times of war
and turmoil.

53
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:03,932
I remember back
in the days of king--

54
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,667
You brought me something?

55
00:07:05,702 --> 00:07:07,836
Yes.

56
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:13,543
Essence of Nightshade

57
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:18,481
is as dangerous
as it is efficacious.

58
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,983
A single drop
in a cup of wine

59
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:25,154
suffices to soothe
ragged nerves.

60
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:27,956
<i>Three drops</i>
<i>will bring on a deep</i>

61
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:30,925
<i>and dreamless sleep.</i>

62
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,693
<i>10 drops, however--</i>

63
00:07:32,728 --> 00:07:34,962
I know what 10 drops
will bring.

64
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:39,032
- Your Grace, if I may ask--
- You may not.

65
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,003
You must have
a lot of work to do.

66
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:46,039
I'm sure many brave men
will need your wisdom soon.

67
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:50,344
Yes.
A siege is very--

68
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,946
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.

69
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,551

Where'd you learn
the Lannister song?

80
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:36,958
Drunk Lannisters.

81
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:39,994
You've got
a pretty voice.

82
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:41,862
Thank you very much.

83
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,364
And I like
your nose.

84
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,333
How many times
you break it?

85
00:08:48,103 --> 00:08:49,904
Well, now let's see.

86
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:53,641
<i>First time I was five.</i>

87
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:55,450
Me mom smacked me
with an iron poker.

88
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:56,977
Ooh.

89
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:59,279
Oh, it wasn't me
she was aiming at.

90
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:01,348
She was trying
for me little brother.

91
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:03,016
Now he was a real pest.

92
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:06,953
Second time I was nine.

93
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:10,089
Got in a scrap
with a few older boys.

94
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:12,325
They won.

95
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,960
Third time...

96
00:09:21,368 --> 00:09:24,304
Eh, you don't want to know
about the third time.

97
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:29,977
Poor nose.

98
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:31,813
Don't feel sorry
for him.

99
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,049
He'll be halfway up your ass
before the night's through.

100
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,730
Welcome, friends.

101
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:53,435
This round's on me.

102
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:04,914
I don't think
he likes me.

103
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,862
You think
you're a hard man?

104
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,302
I know it.

105
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,740
It's warm in here.

106
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,776
We've got beautiful women

107
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,444
and good brown ale.

108
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:37,447
Plenty for everyone.

109
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,182
And all you want

110
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:42,218
is to put one of us
in the cold ground

111
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:44,154
with no women
to keep us company.

112
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:47,123
Oh, there's women
in the ground.

113
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:49,792
I put some there myself.

114
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:52,995
So have you.

115
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,464
You like fucking
and drinking

116
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,366
and singing.

117
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:01,937
But killing--

118
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:04,806
killing's the thing
you love.

119
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,909
You're just like me.

120
00:11:10,645 --> 00:11:12,746
Only smaller.

121
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,416
And quicker.

122
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:19,319
Eh?

123
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:23,490
Your Lord Imp
is gonna miss you.

124
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,134
Aye.

125
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:37,006
I expect he will someday.

126
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:43,479
<i>Here we are.</i>

127
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,791
One more drink
before the war?

128
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:58,926
Shall we?

129
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:12,238
I've always
hated the bells.

130
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:14,073
They ring for horror--

131
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:16,776
a dead king,
a city under siege.

132
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,012
- A wedding.
- Exactly.

133
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:23,051
Podrick, is that it?

134
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,420
"Is that it?"
Nice touch.

135
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,924
As if you don't know the name
of every boy in town.

136
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,661
I'm not entirely sure
what you're suggesting.

137
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:35,131
I'm entirely sure you're entirely
sure what I'm suggesting.

138
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,700
Do you trust him?

139
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,905
Oddly enough, I do.

140
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:46,041
Good.

141
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,347
The map you asked for.

142
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:00,188
There must be 20 miles
of tunnels beneath the city.

143
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:01,923
Closer to 50.

144
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:05,627
<i>The Targaryens built this</i>
<i>city to withstand a siege</i>

145
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:09,398
and to provide escape
if necessary.

146
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:11,367
I'm not escaping.

147
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:13,369
Strange as it sounds,
I'm the captain of the ship.

148
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:15,071
And if the ship goes down,
I go with her.

149
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:16,940
That is good to hear.

150
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:19,108
Though I'm sure many
captains say the same

151
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:22,612
while their ship
is afloat.

152
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:25,381
You look well suited
for battle, My Lord.

153
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:26,783
Well, I'm not.

154
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:29,752
For all our sakes,
I hope you are wrong.

155
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:33,889
My little birds tell me
that Stannis Baratheon

156
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:37,459
has taken up with a Red
Priestess from Asshai.

157
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:38,827
What of it?

158
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:42,365
You don't believe in
the old powers, My Lord?

159
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:45,568
Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting--
what do you think?

160
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:50,139
I think you believe
in what you see

161
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,942
and in what those
you trust have seen.

162
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:57,079
You probably don't
entirely trust me.

163
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:59,014
Mm, don't take it
personally.

164
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:00,983
I don't entirely
trust myself.

165
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,852
And yet I have seen things

166
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,521
<i>and heard things--</i>

167
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:11,224
things you have not,
things I wish I had not.

168
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:16,896
I don't believe I've ever
told you how I was cut.

169
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,500
No, I don't believe
you have.

170
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:24,339
One day I will.

171
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,945
The dark arts have provided
Lord Stannis with his armies

172
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:33,282
and paved his path
to our door.

173
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:37,520
For a man in service to such
powers to sit on the Iron Throne,

174
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:40,923
I can think
of nothing worse.

175
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:42,424
And tonight,

176
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:46,728
I believe you are the only man
who can stop him.

177
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,292
They're welcoming
the new king.

178
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:18,161
I've never known bells
to mean surrender.

179
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,431
They want to play
music with us? Let's play.

180
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:24,366
- Drums.
- Drums!

181
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:50,926
<i>Remember, wait till the shit--</i>

182
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,862
<i>The ships are in the bay.</i>

183
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:54,249
They must be far enough
in so they won't be--

184
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:55,899
I know what "in" means.

185
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,268
- Do you know how to use that?
- I chopped wood once.

186
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:00,737
No, I watched my brother
chopping wood.

187
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:02,638
I saw you kill a man
with a shield.

188
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:04,574
You'll be unstoppable
with an axe.

189
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:08,411
- Don't get killed.
- Nor you, my friend.

190
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:11,815
- Oh, are we friends now?
- Of course we are.

191
00:16:11,849 --> 00:16:13,555
Just because I pay you
for your services doesn't

192
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,884
diminish our friendship.

193
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:16,352
Enhances it, really.

194
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:19,155
Oh, enhances.
Fancy word for a sellsword.

195
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:22,023
Been spending time
with fancy folks.

196
00:16:33,101 --> 00:16:36,303
Lady Sansa
and, uh, Sheila.

197
00:16:36,337 --> 00:16:37,972
Shae.

198
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,574
Shae, yes.

199
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,709
Surely my sister
has asked you to join

200
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:43,378
the other highborn ladies
in Maegor's holdfast.

201
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:44,802
She has, My Lord,

202
00:16:44,827 --> 00:16:46,948
but King Joffrey sent
for me to see him off.

203
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,185
Sansa.

204
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:51,387
He's been a great
romantic, my nephew.

205
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,322
<i>Sansa, come here.</i>

206
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:58,093
I will pray for your
safe return, My Lord.

207
00:16:58,128 --> 00:16:59,628
Will you?

208
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:02,164
Just as I pray
for the King's.

209
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:07,903
Stay safe, My Lady.

210
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:10,071
And you, my lion.

211
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:18,145
Your king rides forth
to battle.

212
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:21,115
You should see him
off with a kiss.

213
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,384
My new blade.

214
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,186
Hearteater I've named it.

215
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,257
Kiss it.

216
00:17:38,834 --> 00:17:40,801
You'll kiss it again
when I return

217
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:42,770
and taste
my Uncle's blood.

218
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:44,571
Will you slay him
yourself?

219
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,041
If Stannis is fool enough
to come near me.

220
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:51,077
So you'll be outside the gates
fighting in the Vanguard?

221
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,846
A king doesn't discuss

222
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:56,282
battle plans
with stupid girls.

223
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:59,252
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
You're right, I'm stupid.

224
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,488
Of course you'll be
in the Vanguard.

225
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,490
They say my brother
Robb always goes

226
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:05,192
where the fighting
is thickest.

227
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:07,027
And he is only
a pretender.

228
00:18:07,062 --> 00:18:09,664
Your brother's turn
will come.

229
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:12,667
Then you can lick his blood
off Hearteater, too.

230
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,615
Some of those boys
will never come back.

231
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,784
Joffrey will.

232
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,552
The worst ones
always live.

233
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:34,588
Shh.
Come, My Lady.

234
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:25,612
- Where's our fleet?
- On the way.

235
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,060
Why isn't it here now?
They're coming.

236
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:33,418
Hound, tell the Hand that his
King has asked him a question.

237
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,487
The King has asked
you a question.

238
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:37,956
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound
to tell the king

239
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:39,791
that the Hand
is extremely busy.

240
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:41,601
The Hand of the King
would like me to tell

241
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:42,994
you to tell the King--

242
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:44,729
If I tell the Hound
to cut you in half,

243
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,297
he'll do it without
a second thought.

244
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:48,132
That would make me
the Quarterman.

245
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,201
It just doesn't have
the same ring to it.

246
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:54,037
Cut me in half and I won't
be able to give the signal.

247
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:55,705
<i>No signal, no plan.</i>

248
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,779
No plan and Stannis
Baratheon sacks this city,

249
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:00,652
takes the Iron Throne,
puts your pinched

250
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:02,200
little head atop
a gate somewhere.

251
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,815
It might be quite amusing,

252
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:06,684
except that my head
would be up there, too.

253
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:08,586
I've never much
liked my head,

254
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,123
but I don't want to see
it removed just yet.

255
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:16,195
Where are their ships?

256
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:19,064
It is wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.

257
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:22,201
Lord Varys knows what you had
for breakfast three days ago.

258
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:23,835
There are
no surprises here.

259
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,804
If it's true there is dissension
in their ranks,

260
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:28,006
maybe their sailors
have mutinied.

261
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,142
Maybe.

262
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,925
I don't know why
she wants me here.

263
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,895
She's always saying
how stupid I am. She hates me.

264
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,132
Maybe she hates you less than
she hates everyone else.

265
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,135
I doubt it.

266
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:00,071
Maybe she's
jealous of you.

267
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:02,073
Why would she
be jealous?

268
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,109
Sansa.

269
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,149
I was wondering where
our little dove had flown.

270
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:13,620
You look pale, child.

271
00:21:13,654 --> 00:21:15,755
Is your red flower
still blooming?

272
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,958
Yes.

273
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:19,659
Fitting, isn't it?

274
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:23,630
The men will bleed out there
and you will bleed in here.

275
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,665
Pour Lady Sansa
some wine.

276
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,534
I'm not thirsty,
Your Grace.

277
00:21:27,568 --> 00:21:31,104
So? I didn't
offer you water.

278
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:36,943
What's he doing here?

279
00:21:36,978 --> 00:21:39,346
Ser Ilyn?

280
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,982
<i>He's here to defend us.</i>

281
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,717
When the axes smash
down those doors,

282
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,152
you may be glad
to have him.

283
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:47,454
But we have guards
to defend us.

284
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:49,122
Guards we have paid.

285
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:51,087
Should the city fall,
they'll be the first ones

286
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:52,693
out of the doors.

287
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:59,098
The lads caught a groom and
two maids trying to sneak away

288
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,601
<i>with a stolen horse</i>
<i>and some gold cups.</i>

289
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:03,904
The battle's first
traitors.

290
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:05,572
Have Ser Ilyn
see to them.

291
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:09,376
Put their heads on spikes outside
the stables as a warning.

292
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,447
The only way to keep
the small folk loyal

293
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:16,617
is to make certain they fear you
more than they do the enemy.

294
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:21,423
Remember that if you ever
hope to become a queen.

295
00:22:22,725 --> 00:22:25,161
You said he was here
to protect us.

296
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:29,132
He is.

297
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,902
Traitors are a danger
to us all.

298
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,671
More wine.

299
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:50,087
There they are.

300
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:57,361
- Archers to their marks.
- Archers, to your marks!

301
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:01,198
<i>Archers!</i>

302
00:23:07,004 --> 00:23:08,204
Nock your arrows!

303
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:10,807
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

304
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:14,677
- Hold fast.
<i>- Hold fast!</i>

305
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,912
What are you doing?
We need to attack them.

306
00:23:16,946 --> 00:23:21,216
- Hold fast.
<i>- Boulders ready!</i>

307
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:23,552
<i>Hold fast!</i>

308
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:28,190
There's only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?

309
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:31,193
Where are
the rest of them?!

310
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,065
There's only one ship.

311
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:42,839
Archers, stand to!

312
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:44,274
<i>Man the below!</i>

313
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:46,843
- Nock!
<i>- Nock and set!</i>

314
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:49,881
Draw!

315
00:23:54,954 --> 00:23:56,489
Hold.

316
00:23:56,523 --> 00:23:58,558
<i>Hold!</i>

317
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,934
There's no one on board.

318
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:17,577
<i>More rocks coming up!</i>

319
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,394
<i>Hold.</i>

320
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:42,536
Wildfire.

321
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,739
Steer clear!
Steer clear!

322
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:12,965
Matthos!
Get down!

323
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:49,125
- Prepare to land.
- Your Grace...

324
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,261
The dwarf has played
his little trick.

325
00:26:51,295 --> 00:26:53,730
- The wildfire--
- He can only play it once.

326
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:56,033
We're too far
from the gates.

327
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:58,869
The fire,
their archers--

328
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:01,738
hundreds will die.

329
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,907
Thousands.

330
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,188
Come with me
and take this city!

331
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:39,741
Sansa, come here,
little dove.

332
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:48,150
My queen.

333
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:50,251
What are you doing?

334
00:27:50,286 --> 00:27:51,586
Praying.

335
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,055
You're perfect,
aren't you?

336
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,424
Praying.

337
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:58,292
<i>What are you praying for?</i>

338
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:00,728
For the Gods to have
mercy on us all.

339
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,964
Oh.
On all of us?

340
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:06,599
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Even me?

341
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,534
Of course,
Your Grace.

342
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:10,236
Even Joffrey?

343
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:15,674
- Joffrey is my--
- Oh, shut up, you little fool.

344
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,744
Praying to the Gods
to have mercy on us all.

345
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:21,247
The Gods have no mercy.
That's why they're Gods.

346
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,585
<i>My father told me that</i>
<i>when he caught me praying.</i>

347
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,023
My mother just died,
you see.

348
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:31,525
I didn't really understand
the concept of death,

349
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,061
the finality of it.

350
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:36,497
I thought that if I prayed
very, very hard,

351
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:39,733
the Gods would return
my mother to me. I was four.

352
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:42,536
Your father doesn't
believe in the Gods?

353
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,305
He believes in them, he just
doesn't like them very much.

354
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:50,343
One for her.

355
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,814
Here.

356
00:28:57,183 --> 00:28:58,550
Sit.

357
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:00,586
Drink.

358
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:05,959
Not like that.
Drink, girl.

359
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:11,298
I should have been
born a man.

360
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,502
I'd rather face 1,000 swords
than be shut up inside

361
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:17,071
with this flock
of frightened hens.

362
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,441
They are your guests
under your protection.

363
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:20,909
You asked them here.

364
00:29:20,943 --> 00:29:23,077
It was expected of me,

365
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:27,415
as it will be of you if you ever
become Joffrey's queen.

366
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,786
If my wretched brother
should somehow prevail,

367
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,656
these hens will return
to their cocks

368
00:29:34,724 --> 00:29:38,127
and crow of how my courage
inspired them,

369
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,962
lifted their spirits.

370
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:42,265
And if the city
should fall?

371
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:47,069
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

372
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:49,204
The Red Keep
should hold for a time,

373
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,040
long enough for me
to go to the walls

374
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:54,042
and yield to Lord Stannis
in person.

375
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:56,612
If it were anyone else
outside those gates,

376
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:58,581
I might have hoped
for a private audience.

377
00:29:58,615 --> 00:30:01,484
But this is Stannis Baratheon.

378
00:30:01,518 --> 00:30:05,287
I'd have a better chance
of seducing his horse.

379
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:10,525
Have I shocked you,
little dove?

380
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,662
Tears aren't a woman's
only weapon.

381
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,865
The best one's
between your legs.

382
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,136
Learn how to use it.
Drink.

383
00:30:24,473 --> 00:30:26,608
Do you have any notion
of what happens

384
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:29,512
when a city is sacked?

385
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:32,148
No, you wouldn't,
would you?

386
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:37,288
If the city falls,
these fine women

387
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:40,357
should be in
for a bit of a rape.

388
00:30:40,392 --> 00:30:42,226
<i>Half of them</i>
<i>will have bastards</i>

389
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,795
in their bellies
come the morning.

390
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:47,664
You'll be glad of
your red flower then.

391
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,133
When a man's blood
is up,

392
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:53,135
anything with tits
looks good.

393
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,803
A precious thing like you

394
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:58,807
will look very, very good.

395
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:01,076
A slice of cake

396
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,346
just waiting to be eaten.

397
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:08,918
More pressure!

398
00:31:18,396 --> 00:31:21,398
- Pull! Pull!
- That's it, men!

399
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:24,634
<i>Pull! Pull!</i>

400
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:28,404
<i>That's it!</i>
<i>Steady!</i>

401
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:31,641
He's a serious man--
Stannis Baratheon.

402
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:34,110
They're coming.
They're coming ashore.

403
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,846
Rain fire on them.

404
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,614
Archers!

405
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,049
There are too many.

406
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:42,985
Hound, form a welcome party
for any Baratheon troop

407
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:45,354
that manages to touch
solid ground.

408
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:50,125
Pod, run to
the King's gate.

409
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,893
Bring any men
guarding it here now.

410
00:31:51,928 --> 00:31:53,962
Yes, My Lord.

411
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:57,865
Let's go. Stannis is sending
us fresh meat.

412
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,834
You, too.

413
00:32:01,237 --> 00:32:03,939
Any of these flaming
fucking arrows come near me,

414
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:06,376
I'll strangle you
with your own guts.

415
00:32:10,915 --> 00:32:13,517
Pull, pull! Go!

416
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:15,653
Nock!

417
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:21,258
<i>Draw!</i>

418
00:32:21,293 --> 00:32:24,595
- <i>Draw!</i>
- Draw!

419
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,606
<i>Kill the Lannisters!</i>

420
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,208
Loose!

421
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:37,609
Loose!

422
00:32:40,013 --> 00:32:42,781
Form the line!

423
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,918
Stannis!

424
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:48,654
- Draw!
- <i>Draw!</i>

425
00:32:48,688 --> 00:32:51,256
- Loose!
- <i>Loose!</i>

426
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,714
<i>They cannot</i>
<i>breach the wall!</i>

427
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,158
Yah!

428
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:37,702
The mud gate, go now!

429
00:33:37,736 --> 00:33:40,905
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the mud gate!

430
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:42,939
Any man dies
with a clean sword,

431
00:33:42,974 --> 00:33:45,942
I'll rape
his fucking corpse.

432
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:22,580
<i>When we were young,</i>
<i>Jaime and I,</i>

433
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:24,015
<i>we looked so much alike.</i>

434
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,418
<i>Even our father</i>
<i>couldn't tell us apart.</i>

435
00:34:26,452 --> 00:34:31,056
<i>I could never understand why</i>
<i>they treated us differently.</i>

436
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,960
Jaime was taught to fight
with sword and lance and mace,

437
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:37,796
and I was taught to smile

438
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,731
<i>and sing and please.</i>

439
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:42,768
He was heir
to Casterly Rock

440
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:45,370
and I was sold to some
stranger like a horse

441
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:47,639
to be ridden
whenever he desired.

442
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:50,374
You were Robert's queen.

443
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:52,376
And you will be
Joffrey's. Enjoy.

444
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,014
I don't think
I know this one.

445
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:05,887
Pretty.

446
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:14,062
That's the worst
curtsy I've ever seen.

447
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:16,998
Here, it's not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.

448
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:20,235
Straighten your back
and bend.

449
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:24,873
Better.
You learn fast.

450
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:28,878
How long have you been
in Lady Sansa's service?

451
00:35:28,912 --> 00:35:31,848
A few weeks,
Your Grace.

452
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:36,952
When did you
leave Lorath?

453
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:40,922
I had a Lorathi
handmaiden once.

454
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,127
But she was
a nobleman's daughter.

455
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:48,029
You're not.

456
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,634
When did you come
to Westeros?

457
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:57,004
10 years ago,
Your Grace.

458
00:35:57,038 --> 00:36:00,240
From Lorathi commoner
to the Red Keep

459
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:04,144
in 10 years, all without
learning how to curtsy.

460
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,814
I imagine that's
a very interesting story.

461
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:10,150
What's your name?

462
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,686
Shae, Your Grace.

463
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,922
Tell us a story, Shae.

464
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:23,298
When I was 13, I--

465
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,268
Your Grace!

466
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:29,371
What news?

467
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:31,473
The Imp has set
the river afire.

468
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:34,042
Hundreds of ships
are burning, maybe more.

469
00:36:34,077 --> 00:36:37,546
Stannis's fleet
destroyed, but...

470
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,782
But-- but his troops

471
00:36:40,817 --> 00:36:43,317
have landed outside
the city walls.

472
00:36:43,352 --> 00:36:45,453
Where is Joffrey?

473
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:47,755
On the battlements
with Lord Tyrion.

474
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,023
Bring him back
inside at once.

475
00:36:50,057 --> 00:36:52,993
- But, Your Grace--
- What?

476
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,262
The King's presence
is good for morale.

477
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,898
Bring him back
to his chambers now.

478
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:59,900
- Not here?
- With the women and children?

479
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,603
Do you want him to be mocked as
a coward for the rest of his life?

480
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,972
- No, but I--
- Now!

481
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:13,213
When I told you about
Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.

482
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:16,984
Do you want to hear
the truth?

483
00:37:17,018 --> 00:37:19,052
You want to know why
he's really here?

484
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,823
He's here for us.

485
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:26,060
Stannis may take the city,
he may take the throne,

486
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:29,196
but he will not
take us alive.

487
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:04,566
<i>- Ah! Help me!</i>

488
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:25,321
We'd better run!

489
00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:28,058
Fall back!

490
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:36,365
Get the ladders up!

491
00:39:09,268 --> 00:39:12,437
Faster, you bastards!
Faster!

492
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:14,506
Come on, kill the scum!

493
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,677
Someone bring me a drink.

494
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:27,919
Fuck the water.
Bring me wine.

495
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:40,366
Can I get you
some iced milk

496
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:42,802
and a nice bowl
of raspberries, too?

497
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,471
Eat shit, dwarf.

498
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:47,174
You're on the wrong
side of the wall.

499
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:50,244
I lost half my men.

500
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:52,647
The Blackwater's on fire.

501
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:55,783
Dog, I command you to go
back out there and fight.

502
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:01,789
You're Kingsguard, Clegane.

503
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:04,591
You must beat them back or
they're going to take this city--

504
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:07,061
your king's city.

505
00:40:07,095 --> 00:40:10,297
Fuck the Kingsguard.

506
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:13,800
Fuck the city.

507
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,635
Fuck the King.

508
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:34,523
Loose!

509
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,393
Put your backs into it!

510
00:40:37,427 --> 00:40:39,662
All right, get up!

511
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:43,600
Loose!

512
00:40:43,634 --> 00:40:44,901
<i>Clear!</i>

513
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:48,005
Forward!

514
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,108
Loose!

515
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:03,922
Forward ladders!

516
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:20,470
<i>They're coming</i>
<i>up the wall!</i>

517
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:22,905
<i>Archers on the north wall!</i>

518
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,540
<i>- Heave!</i>

519
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:26,308
<i>- Heave!</i>

520
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:28,010
Your Grace,

521
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:31,380
<i>the queen has sent me to bring</i>
<i>you back to the Red Keep.</i>

522
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:35,984
If you won't defend your
own city, why should they?

523
00:41:36,018 --> 00:41:37,786
What would you
have me do?

524
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,887
Lead.

525
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:41,089
<i>Get down there</i>
<i>and lead your people</i>

526
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,691
against the invaders
who want to kill them.

527
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:44,693
What did my mother
say exactly?

528
00:41:44,727 --> 00:41:46,495
Did she have urgent
business with me?

529
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:48,297
She did not say,
Your Grace.

530
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:52,467
<i>All men to the battlements!</i>

531
00:41:53,703 --> 00:41:55,404
Ser Boros,
Ser Mandon,

532
00:41:55,438 --> 00:41:57,672
stay with my Uncle
and represent the king

533
00:41:57,697 --> 00:41:59,444
on the field of battle.

534
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:03,278
<i>Archers, hold your line</i>

535
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,147
<i>or I'll kill you myself.</i>

536
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:10,819
<i>Stand fast!</i>

537
00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:19,962
No!

538
00:42:21,564 --> 00:42:23,064
Get up, you fool.

539
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:26,235
<i>We need more arrows!</i>

540
00:42:29,072 --> 00:42:30,706
<i>Where is the king?</i>

541
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:34,143
- <i>Why isn't he with us?</i>
<i>- Who are we fighting for?</i>

542
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:37,213
<i>Who leads us?</i>

543
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:39,717
I'll lead the attack.

544
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:41,418
I'll lead the attack!

545
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:44,789
- Yes?
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

546
00:42:44,824 --> 00:42:46,458
Pod, my helmet.

547
00:42:48,728 --> 00:42:50,896
Ser Mandon, you will bear
the King's banner.

548
00:42:50,931 --> 00:42:53,465
Men, form up.

549
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:57,136
<i>Men--</i>

550
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,337
- <i>men!</i>
- Come on.

551
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:02,040
They say I'm half a man.

552
00:43:02,074 --> 00:43:04,776
But what does that make
the lot of you?

553
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:07,345
The only way out
is through the gates.

554
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,113
And they're at the gates.

555
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:11,648
There's another way out.
I'm going to show you.

556
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:14,552
We'll come out behind them
and fuck them in their asses.

557
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:19,556
<i>Heave!</i>

558
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,691
<i>Heave!</i>

559
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:23,526
Don't fight for your king

560
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,362
and don't fight
for his kingdoms.

561
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:29,965
<i>Don't fight for honor.</i>
<i>Don't fight for glory.</i>

562
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,401
Don't fight for riches,
because you won't get any.

563
00:43:32,435 --> 00:43:34,903
This is your city
Stannis means to sack.

564
00:43:34,938 --> 00:43:36,972
That's your gate
he's ramming.

565
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:41,076
<i>If he gets in, it will be</i>
<i>your houses he burns,</i>

566
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,612
your gold he steals,

567
00:43:43,646 --> 00:43:46,481
your women he will rape.

568
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:49,518
Heave! Heave!

569
00:43:49,552 --> 00:43:53,255
<i>Heave! Heave!</i>

570
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:57,427
Those are brave me
knocking at our door.

571
00:43:58,529 --> 00:43:59,963
Let's go kill them.

572
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:24,588
The battle is lost,
Your Grace.

573
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,158
Stannis's troops
are at the gates.

574
00:44:28,193 --> 00:44:30,628
When the Gold Cloaks
saw the king leaving,

575
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:32,295
they lost all heart.

576
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:34,831
Where is my son?

577
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,904
I want to escort him
back to the battle.

578
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,725
Why do I care what you want?

579
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:42,471
- Bring me--
- Now listen to me-- ah!

580
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:51,645
Don't be afraid. The queen has
raised the drawbridge.

581
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:53,914
This is the safest
place we can be.

582
00:44:53,948 --> 00:44:56,950
Joffrey's not hurt.
He's fighting bravely.

583
00:44:56,984 --> 00:44:58,852
<i>His knights have</i>
<i>rallied behind him.</i>

584
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:00,420
<i>They will save the city.</i>

585
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:02,989
Shall we sing a hymn?

586
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:06,160
<i>♪ Gentle mother ♪</i>

587
00:45:06,194 --> 00:45:08,862
♪ font of mercy ♪

588
00:45:08,896 --> 00:45:13,234
♪ save our sons
from war, we pray ♪

589
00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:15,636
- ♪ gentle-- ♪
- You must go.

590
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,573
Run to your chamber
and bar your door.

591
00:45:18,608 --> 00:45:21,977
Stannis won't hurt you.
This one will.

592
00:45:24,214 --> 00:45:25,914
Come with me.

593
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:27,650
I need to say goodbye
to someone.

594
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:29,819
The queen said
they'd rape everyone.

595
00:45:29,854 --> 00:45:31,788
No one is raping me.

596
00:45:33,824 --> 00:45:36,927
Go. Run.

597
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:42,065
<i>♪ save our sons</i>
<i>from war, we pray. ♪</i>

598
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:17,267
The lady is starting to panic.

599
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:19,603
What are you doing here?

600
00:46:19,637 --> 00:46:21,738
<i>Not here for long.</i>

601
00:46:21,773 --> 00:46:24,407
- I'm going.
- Where?

602
00:46:24,442 --> 00:46:28,011
Someplace that
isn't burning.

603
00:46:29,513 --> 00:46:31,247
North, might be.

604
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:33,950
Could be.

605
00:46:33,984 --> 00:46:36,619
What about the king?

606
00:46:36,653 --> 00:46:39,955
He can die just fine
on his own.

607
00:46:45,327 --> 00:46:47,661
I can take you with me.

608
00:46:47,696 --> 00:46:50,097
Take you to Winterfell.

609
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:57,371
I'll keep you safe.

610
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:02,377
Do you want to go home?

611
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:06,848
I'll be safe here.

612
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:08,584
Stannis won't hurt me.

613
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:13,455
Look at me.

614
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,825
Stannis is a killer.

615
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:17,826
The Lannisters
are killers.

616
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:20,629
Your father was a killer.

617
00:47:20,664 --> 00:47:23,499
Your brother is a killer.

618
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,169
Your sons will be
killers someday.

619
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:31,974
The world is built
by killers.

620
00:47:35,412 --> 00:47:37,913
So you'd better get
used to looking at them.

621
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:44,320
You won't hurt me.

622
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:53,129
No, little bird,
I won't hurt you.

623
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,055
Heave! Heave!

624
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:25,662
Come on, you bastards!
Get up those ladders!

625
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:27,865
Ah!

626
00:48:30,901 --> 00:48:32,702
Attack!

627
00:48:46,651 --> 00:48:48,152
Roll it over!

628
00:48:55,027 --> 00:48:59,097
Halfman! Halfman!
Halfman! Halfman!

629
00:48:59,131 --> 00:49:03,301
Halfman! Halfman!
Halfman! Halfman!

630
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:12,277
Oh, fuck me.

631
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:06,231
Shh.

632
00:50:06,265 --> 00:50:07,866
Be calm, my sweet.

633
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,968
They're still fighting.

634
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:14,572
No one's going
to hurt you.

635
00:50:17,943 --> 00:50:20,244
<i>I'll tell you a story.</i>

636
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:23,613
You know the one about the
mother lion and her little cub?

637
00:50:23,648 --> 00:50:26,616
- They lived in the woods.
- The Kingswood.

638
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,918
Yes, my love.

639
00:50:28,953 --> 00:50:32,389
In the Kingswood there lived
a mother and her cub.

640
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:34,524
She loved him very much.

641
00:50:34,558 --> 00:50:38,195
But there were other things
that lived in the woods.

642
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:41,165
- Evil things.
- Like what?

643
00:50:43,101 --> 00:50:44,869
Like stags.

644
00:50:44,903 --> 00:50:47,005
Stags aren't evil.

645
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:49,374
They only eat grass.

646
00:50:49,409 --> 00:50:50,909
And wolves.

647
00:50:50,944 --> 00:50:52,511
My Lord.

648
00:50:52,545 --> 00:50:54,847
<i>He could hear them</i>
<i>howling in the night.</i>

649
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:56,915
<i>The little cub</i>
<i>was frightened.</i>

650
00:50:56,949 --> 00:51:00,184
<i>His mother said,</i>
<i>"You are a lion, my son.</i>

651
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:01,853
<i>You mustn't be afraid.</i>

652
00:51:14,866 --> 00:51:17,935
For one day all the beasts
will bow to you.

653
00:51:17,937 --> 00:51:19,937
You will be king.

654
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:25,644
<i>All the stags will bow.</i>Ts
<i>all the wolves will bow.</i>

655
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:29,949
The bears in the north
and the foxes of the south,

656
00:51:29,984 --> 00:51:34,521
<i>all the birds in the sky</i>
<i>and the beasts in the sea--</i>

657
00:51:36,123 --> 00:51:38,658
they will all come
to you, little lion...

658
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:41,661
to rest a crown
upon your head."

659
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:49,369
And the cub said,

660
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:52,605
"Will I be strong
and fierce like my father?"

661
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:56,175
"Yes," said his mother.

662
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:59,612
"You will be strong and fierce
just like your father."

663
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:21,933
I will keep you safe,
my love.

664
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:23,935
I promise you.

665
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:35,246
Back to the boats!

666
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:39,517
Stand and fight!

667
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:43,121
<i>Stand and fight,</i>
<i>damn you!</i>

668
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:45,991
No!

669
00:52:47,994 --> 00:52:49,629
Father.

670
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:57,869
The battle is over.
We have won.
