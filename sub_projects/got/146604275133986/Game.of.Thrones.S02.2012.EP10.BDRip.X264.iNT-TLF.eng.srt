1
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,179
Pod.

2
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,451
Pod!

3
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:34,055
Find Bronn or Varys.

4
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,160
<i>Tell them I am here</i>
<i>with Maester Pycelle.</i>

5
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:40,997
Tell them I am
very much alive.

6
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,967
Yes, My Lord.

7
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,238
Would you like
something for the pain?

8
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,508
What happened?

9
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:53,311
The murderer and traitor
Stannis Baratheon

10
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:57,849
suffered a stunning defeat
at the hands of your father.

11
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,485
Where am I?

12
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,421
These are your new chambers.

13
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:07,391
A little cramped,
perhaps,

14
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,794
but you don't need
much room, do you?

15
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:13,464
<i>You are no longer</i>
<i>Hand of the King.</i>

16
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:19,704
Oh.

17
00:03:21,907 --> 00:03:23,508
For your trouble.

18
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:51,904
<i>I, Joffrey of the House</i>
<i>Baratheon, first of my name,</i>

19
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:54,339
the rightful King
of the Andals

20
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:56,140
and the First Men,

21
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:58,142
Lord of the Seven
Kingdoms

22
00:03:58,176 --> 00:03:59,743
and protector
of the Realm,

23
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:02,078
<i>do hereby proclaim</i>
<i>my grandfather</i>

24
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:05,681
<i>Tywin Lannister</i>
<i>the savior of the city</i>

25
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:08,183
and the Hand of the King.

26
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:22,264
Thank you, Your Grace.

27
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,877
Lord Petyr Baelish,
step forward.

28
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,582
For your good service
and ingenuity

29
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:42,185
in uniting the Houses
of Lannister and Tyrell,

30
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:45,188
<i>I declare that you shall be granted</i>
<i>the castle of Harrenhal...</i>

31
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:47,924
<i>With all its attendant</i>
<i>lands and incomes</i>

32
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,993
<i>to be held by your sons</i>
<i>and grandsons</i>

33
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:52,829
from this day until
the end of time.

34
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,431
You honor me
beyond words, Your Grace.

35
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:01,237
I shall have to acquire
some sons and grandsons.

36
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:06,243
Ser Loras Tyrell.

37
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:14,785
Your House has come
to our aid.

38
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,521
The whole realm
is in your debt,

39
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,456
none more so than I.

40
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,460
If your family would ask
anything of me, ask it

41
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,562
and it shall be yours.

42
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,898
Your Grace,

43
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,467
my sister Margaery,

44
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,103
her husband was taken
from us before...

45
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,207
She remains innocent.

46
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,576
I would ask you to
find it in your heart

47
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:38,679
to do us the great honor
of joining our Houses.

48
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:43,618
Is this what you want,
Lady Margaery?

49
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:49,457
With all my heart,
Your Grace.

50
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:52,160
I have come to love
you from afar.

51
00:05:52,194 --> 00:05:54,696
Tales of your
courage and wisdom

52
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,531
<i>have never been</i>
<i>far from my ears.</i>

53
00:05:56,565 --> 00:06:01,668
And those tales have taken
root deep inside of me.

54
00:06:03,938 --> 00:06:09,008
Well, I too have heard tales
of your beauty and grace,

55
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:11,377
<i>but the tales</i>

56
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,946
do not do you justice,
My Lady.

57
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,885
<i>It would be an honor</i>
<i>to return your love,</i>

58
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,454
but I am promised
to another.

59
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,224
A King must keep
his word.

60
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:28,128
Your Grace, in the judgment
of your small council,

61
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:30,330
it would be neither
proper nor wise

62
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:33,900
for you to wed the daughter
of a man beheaded for treason,

63
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,402
a girl whose brother
is in open rebellion

64
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,704
against the throne
as we speak.

65
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:41,240
For the good
of the realm,

66
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:44,476
your councilors
beg you...

67
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:48,079
to set Sansa Stark aside.

68
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:54,318
- Margaery!
- We want Margaery!

69
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:58,722
<i>I would like to heed</i>
<i>your wishes</i>

70
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:01,192
<i>and the wishes</i>
<i>of my people,</i>

71
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:04,062
but I took
a holy vow.

72
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,097
<i>Your Grace,</i>

73
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:09,967
the Gods do indeed
hold betrothal solemn,

74
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:14,439
but your father,
blessed be his memory,

75
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:17,609
made this pact
before the Starks

76
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:21,279
revealed their falseness.

77
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:24,616
<i>I have consulted</i>
<i>with the High Septon</i>

78
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,921
and he assures me that their
crimes against the realm

79
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:32,791
<i>free you from any promise</i>
<i>you have made to them</i>

80
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:36,761
<i>in the sight</i>
<i>of the Gods.</i>

81
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:39,330
The Gods are good.

82
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,867
I am free
to heed my heart.

83
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:46,438
<i>Ser Loras, I will gladly</i>
<i>wed your sweet sister.</i>

84
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:48,239
<i>You will be my Queen</i>

85
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:51,842
and I will love you
from this day

86
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:53,944
until my last day.

87
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:19,372
My Lady.

88
00:08:19,406 --> 00:08:22,241
<i>My sincerest condolences.</i>

89
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:24,710
They're right--
I'm not good enough for him.

90
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:26,445
You shouldn't say that.

91
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,947
You'll be good enough
for many things.

92
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:31,215
He'll still enjoy
beating you.

93
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:34,218
And now that
you're a woman,

94
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:37,355
he'll be able to enjoy you
in other ways as well.

95
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:40,358
But if he's not
marrying me--

96
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:43,662
He'll let you go home?

97
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:47,100
Joffrey's not the sort of boy
who gives away his toys.

98
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,036
You have a tender heart,

99
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,006
just like your mother
did at your age.

100
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,510
I can see so much
of her in you.

101
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:59,378
She was like
a sister to me.

102
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,281
For her sake,

103
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:05,484
I'll help get you home.

104
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:11,021
King's Landing
is my home now.

105
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:14,458
Look around you.

106
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:17,627
We're all liars here.

107
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:20,931
And every one of us
is better than you.

108
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,578
Come in.

109
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:36,880
Make yourself
comfortable.

110
00:09:43,286 --> 00:09:46,354
That doesn't look
very comfortable.

111
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:49,390
Here, watch me.

112
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,262
No need for that,
my dear.

113
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:56,731
You sure?

114
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,733
Most men like
what they see.

115
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,402
I'm not like
most men.

116
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,904
<i>That's what most men say.</i>

117
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:06,408
If you don't want
what most men want,

118
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:09,112
then you'd better tell me
what you'd like me to do.

119
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:14,151
I would like you to tell me
if working for Lord Baelish

120
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:16,620
has been all you'd
hoped it would be.

121
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,356
Have we met?

122
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,092
You wouldn't
remember me if we had?

123
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:23,760
I meet a lot of men.

124
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:26,263
And I think you
remember all of them.

125
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:29,900
I think your true talents
are wasted on them.

126
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:32,703
You're very kind,
My Lord.

127
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,171
Allow me to return
the favor.

128
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,047
You're afraid.

129
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:46,883
Why?
Nothing dangerous down there.

130
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:49,319
I know who you are.

131
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:52,522
And, unlike your
current employer,

132
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:55,258
I protect those
who work for me.

133
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,362
I don't abuse them
to satisfy royal whims

134
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,964
or force them
to abuse each other.

135
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,733
How do you know
about that?

136
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:06,237
I thought you said
you knew who I was.

137
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:10,408
What can I do for you,
Lord Varys?

138
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:24,855
Littlefinger looks at you

139
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:27,324
and sees a collection
of profitable holes.

140
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:30,727
I see a potential
partner.

141
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:36,166
- I'm afraid of him.
- Oh, you should be.

142
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,869
He's a dangerous man.

143
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:42,172
But everyone has
their weaknesses.

144
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:46,377
Your current employer
hides his very well,

145
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:48,846
but not as well
as he thinks.

146
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:55,588
You're a virgin,
I take it?

147
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:57,689
Walk.

148
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:01,393
Childhood must have
been awful for you.

149
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:04,630
Were you a foot taller
than all the boys?

150
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:07,633
They laughed at you,
called you names?

151
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,936
Some boys
like a challenge.

152
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,407
One or two must have
tried to get inside big Brienne.

153
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,477
- One or two tried.
- Ah.

154
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,712
But you fought them off.

155
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:21,782
But maybe you wished one
of them could overpower you,

156
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:24,251
fling you down,
tear off your clothes.

157
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,687
But none of them
were strong enough.

158
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,990
- I'm strong enough.
- Not interested.

159
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:30,559
Of course you are.

160
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:33,295
You'd love to know what it
feels like to be a woman.

161
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,801
<i>Ah. "They lay</i>
<i>with lions."</i>

162
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:41,502
Tavern girls, I'd say.

163
00:12:41,537 --> 00:12:44,572
Probably served
my father's soldiers.

164
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:47,741
Maybe one of them
gave up a kiss and a feel.

165
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,276
That's how
they earned this.

166
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:54,180
The glorious work of the
northern freedom fighters.

167
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:56,449
Must make you proud
to serve the Starks.

168
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,454
I don't serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.

169
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,390
Tell yourself that tonight
when they swing in your dreams.

170
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,165
- What are you doing?
- Burying them.

171
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:13,636
We shouldn't stay here.
We should get back on the river.

172
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,805
I think these women
would understand if--

173
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:17,306
I don't care
what you think.

174
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,707
<i>I didn't leave it here.</i>

175
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:20,843
Untie me now.

176
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,642
<i>I gave it to you to cut</i>
<i>the rope, and now I don't</i>

177
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,045
<i>have me dagger no more.</i>

178
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:26,548
So unless it got stuck in your ass
on its way to your cunt,

179
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:29,550
it stands to reason
that it's gone-- whoa!

180
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:32,686
What's your business here?

181
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,687
Traveling a prisoner.

182
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:40,494
You're a woman.
A woman!

183
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,597
<i>Well, fuck me!</i>

184
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,300
If you've quite
finished up--

185
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:49,204
All right,
we'll be going.

186
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,874
Whoa, whoa.

187
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:53,609
Who do you fight for?

188
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:56,111
The Starks.

189
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:00,315
What did he do?

190
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:03,451
Apparently eating is now a crime.
Who knew?

191
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:04,886
No, stealing is a crime.

192
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,355
But it's not a crime to starve.
That's justice for you.

193
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,557
- <i>Where are you taking him?</i>
- To Riverrun.

194
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:11,358
Why Riverrun?

195
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,127
Steal from the Tullys,
it's their dungeons you rot in.

196
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:16,629
- Why not kill him?
- For stealing a pig?

197
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:18,665
I don't give the orders.

198
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,233
He must be important
to someone.

199
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,436
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?

200
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:27,207
All right,
have it your way,

201
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,242
m'lady.

202
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,449
- Do I know you?
- Have you been to Ashemark?

203
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:37,618
- <i>No.</i>
- Then you don't know me.

204
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:40,788
Do you ever go to the river
market at Salt Rock?

205
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:43,358
- Is it near Ashemark?
- <i>No.</i>

206
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,793
I've never been there.

207
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,596
What do you think
of these beauties?

208
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,134
I hope you gave them
quick deaths.

209
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:54,104
Two of them we did, yeah.

210
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,508
Wait.

211
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:02,779
I do know you.

212
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,781
That's Jaime Lannister.

213
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,259
I wish someone had told me.

214
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:07,851
I wouldn't have had
to steal that pig.

215
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,187
If this is the Kingslayer,
I think I'd know about it.

216
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,023
How do you know what
the Kingslayer looks like?

217
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:14,259
I was at Whispering Wood.
I saw him.

218
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:17,162
<i>They dragged him out of the woods</i>
<i>and threw him down before the King.</i>

219
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,731
He's not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.

220
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,833
If he was, I'd only
be traveling his head.

221
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:24,002
I have a question
for you both.

222
00:15:24,036 --> 00:15:26,404
And I want you to answer it
at the same time.

223
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:29,040
<i>I count to three,</i>
<i>you both answer.</i>

224
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:31,476
What's his name?

225
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,845
One.

226
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,681
<i>Two. Three.</i>

227
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:53,564
Two quick deaths.

228
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,558
Those were Stark men.

229
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:26,627
I don't serve the Starks.

230
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:28,562
I serve Lady Catelyn.

231
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,098
I told her I'd take you
to King's Landing,

232
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:33,066
and that's what
I'm going to do.

233
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:37,037
Stay.

234
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,694
Walder Frey is a dangerous
man to cross.

235
00:16:57,728 --> 00:16:59,329
I know that.

236
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:01,531
And you mean
to do it anyway?

237
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:07,438
I love her.

238
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:09,840
I know that seems
important to you.

239
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,808
It is important to me.

240
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:17,046
Your father didn't love
me when we married.

241
00:17:17,081 --> 00:17:20,316
He hardly knew me
or I him.

242
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:25,455
Love didn't just
happen to us.

243
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,126
We built it slowly
over the years,

244
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,195
stone by stone,

245
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:32,598
for you, for your
brothers and sisters,

246
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:35,200
for all of us.

247
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:39,270
It's not as exciting as
secret passion in the woods,

248
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:42,207
but it is stronger.

249
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:45,110
It lasts longer.

250
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,479
And that is what
would be in store for me

251
00:17:47,513 --> 00:17:49,348
with one of
Walder Frey's daughters,

252
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:52,118
- what you and father had?
- Why not?

253
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:53,920
Because she's not beautiful?

254
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:55,956
Because she's not exotic
and exciting?

255
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,093
Now you're arguing just to argue
because you arranged it.

256
00:17:59,127 --> 00:18:01,963
And you agreed to it.

257
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,865
You gave him your word.

258
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:08,771
Treat your oaths recklessly and
your people will do the same.

259
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:10,606
If your father lived
his life for one thing--

260
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,842
My father is dead.

261
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:14,783
And the only parent
I have left has no right

262
00:18:14,808 --> 00:18:16,519
to call anyone reckless.

263
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:39,766
You said you saw
my victory in the flames.

264
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,834
<i>I did.</i>

265
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,504
- I still see it.
- The flames lied.

266
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:48,608
And I'm no better
than a savage

267
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:50,744
trusting in a Fire God.

268
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:55,815
I fought for your God
in Blackwater Bay.

269
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:59,151
I led my men to the gates
of the Seventh Hell

270
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:02,354
as their brothers burned
alive, and for what?

271
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:06,290
Attacked from behind by
Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.

272
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:08,526
If you see so much in your flames,
why didn't you warn me?

273
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,461
The Lord of Light
only allows me glimpses.

274
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:12,796
You claimed to speak
for a God.

275
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,131
Will you quit the war just
because you've lost a battle?

276
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,067
You talk about war
as if you understand it.

277
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:19,302
<i>I've been fighting</i>
<i>far longer than you.</i>

278
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:22,440
Have you?
Show me how you fight.

279
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:29,081
Show me.

280
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:36,389
Where's your God now?

281
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,992
Will he save you?

282
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:42,828
Where is your God?

283
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:47,333
Inside you.

284
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:58,743
I murdered my brother.

285
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:09,589
We murdered him.

286
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:11,358
Share the weight
with me.

287
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,794
He wasn't your brother.

288
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:20,734
This war
has just begun.

289
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,069
It will last for years.

290
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:26,473
Thousands will die
at your command.

291
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:31,245
You will betray
the men serving you.

292
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:34,114
You will betray
your family.

293
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:37,717
You will betray everything
you once held dear.

294
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:42,087
And it will all
be worth it

295
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:45,191
because you are
the Son of Fire.

296
00:20:45,226 --> 00:20:48,428
You are the Warrior
of Light.

297
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:54,166
You will sweep aside
this pretender and that one.

298
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,803
You will be King.

299
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:04,343
You promise
these things, but...

300
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:06,678
you don't know.

301
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,782
None of us know.

302
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,951
Let me show you.

303
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,028
Look into the fire,
my King.

304
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:25,397
Look.

305
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,265
I see fire.

306
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,434
Keep looking.

307
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,710
Do you see?

308
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:42,513
Do you see, my King?

309
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,567
Yes.

310
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:17,081
I will kill that man.

311
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:19,751
I don't care how many arrows
they feather me with,

312
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,153
how many spears
they run through me,

313
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:25,223
I will kill that horn-blowing
cunt before I fall.

314
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:28,060
They want you to know
you're surrounded.

315
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:30,095
I know I'm surrounded.

316
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,898
I know that because I stood
on the battlements

317
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,834
and saw I was surrounded.

318
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:36,602
<i>They don't want</i>
<i>you to sleep.</i>

319
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:38,538
They want to sap
your spirit before--

320
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:42,041
Thank you, wise bald man.

321
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:45,410
Thank you for explaining
siege tactics to me.

322
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:51,082
No word from my father?

323
00:22:52,918 --> 00:22:54,618
No.

324
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:57,021
Send more ravens.

325
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:01,293
You killed
all the ravens.

326
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:06,566
The first time
I saw Winterfell...

327
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,543
The first time
I saw Winterfell,

328
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:17,488
it looked like something
that had been here for

329
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:19,513
thousands of years

330
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:22,149
and would be here
for thousands of years

331
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,417
after I was dead.

332
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:28,954
I saw it
and I thought,

333
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,623
"of course Ned Stark
crushed our rebellion

334
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:34,393
and killed my brothers.

335
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,962
We never stood a chance against
a man who lives here."

336
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:39,699
Lord Stark went out of his way
to make it your home.

337
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,235
Yes, my captors were
so very kind to me.

338
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:44,637
You love
reminding me of that.

339
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,408
Everyone in this
frozen pile of shit

340
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,978
has always loved
reminding me of that.

341
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:55,851
You know what it's like
to be told how lucky you are

342
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:57,886
to be someone's prisoner?

343
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,691
To be told how much
you owe them?

344
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:08,329
And then to go back home
to your real father...

345
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,002
I will kill that man.

346
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,503
I swear it to
the Drowned God,

347
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:17,038
the Old Gods,
the New Gods,

348
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:19,244
to every fucking God
in every fucking heaven,

349
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:21,142
I will kill that man.

350
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,946
Theon, listen to me.

351
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,148
I serve Winterfell.

352
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:29,185
Now Winterfell is yours.

353
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,721
I'm bound by oath
to serve you.

354
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:34,524
And what's your counsel,
trusted friend?

355
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,827
Run.

356
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:39,389
500 Northmen wait
outside the walls.

357
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:41,264
You have 20 men.

358
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:43,199
You can't win.

359
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,401
Wait for nightfall
and run.

360
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:47,903
There's nowhere to run.

361
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:49,905
I'd never make it back
to the Iron Islands.

362
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,641
And even if I did,
even if by some miracle

363
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:55,510
I slipped through the lines
and made it home,

364
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:57,846
I'd be a coward.

365
00:24:57,881 --> 00:25:00,616
The Greyjoy who ran.

366
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:04,486
The shame of the family.

367
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:07,923
Don't go home.

368
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,793
<i>Join the Night's Watch.</i>

369
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,897
Once a man
has taken the Black...

370
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,969
he's beyond reach
of the law.

371
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:24,105
All his past crimes
are forgiven.

372
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:28,176
I won't make it
to the Wall.

373
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:31,513
I won't make it 10 feet
past the Winterfell gates.

374
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,715
There are ways.

375
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:36,584
Hidden passageways built
so the Lords of Winterfell

376
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,987
could escape.

377
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:41,689
The road will be dangerous.

378
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,894
But with a little luck...

379
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:53,468
the Night's Watch is an ancient,
honorable order.

380
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:57,172
You'll have
opportunities there.

381
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:02,978
The opportunity for Jon Snow
to cut my throat in my sleep.

382
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:07,049
The opportunity to make
amends for what you've done.

383
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,554
I've done a lot,
haven't I?

384
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:15,457
Things I never
imagined myself doing.

385
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:21,763
I've known you many years,
Theon Greyjoy.

386
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,503
You're not the man
you're pretending to be.

387
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:31,273
Not yet.

388
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,878
You may be right.

389
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:42,617
But I've gone too far
to pretend to be anything else.

390
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:55,163
You hear that?

391
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,332
That's the mating call
of the Northmen.

392
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,235
They want to fuck us.

393
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,470
Well, I haven't had
a good fuck in weeks.

394
00:27:03,505 --> 00:27:06,106
I'm ready for one.

395
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,744
They say every Ironborn man is
worth a dozen from the mainland.

396
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:11,645
Aye!

397
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,683
- You think they're right?
- Aye.

398
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:19,520
We die today, brothers.

399
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,689
We die bleeding
from 100 wounds

400
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:27,527
with arrows in our necks
and spears in our guts,

401
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,398
but our war cries will echo
through eternity.

402
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:34,401
They will sing about
the battle of Winterfell

403
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,337
until the Iron Islands have
slipped beneath the waves.

404
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:41,341
Every man, woman, and child
will know who we were

405
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:44,110
and how long we stood.

406
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:45,979
Aggar and Gelmarr;

407
00:27:46,013 --> 00:27:47,514
Wex and Urzen;

408
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:49,649
Stygg and Black Lorren--

409
00:27:49,684 --> 00:27:52,952
Ironborn warriors
will cry out our names

410
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:56,289
as they leap onto the shores
of Seagard and Faircastle.

411
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:57,757
Aye!

412
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,426
- Mothers will name their sons for us.
- Aye!

413
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,128
Girls will think of us
with their lovers inside them.

414
00:28:03,163 --> 00:28:04,696
Aye!

415
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,799
And whoever kills
that fucking horn-blower

416
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,902
will stand in bronze
above the shores of Pyke!

417
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:11,436
Aye!

418
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,305
- What is dead may never die!
- What is dead may never die!

419
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,774
Ah!

420
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:21,079
Thought he'd never shut up.

421
00:28:21,113 --> 00:28:23,514
It was a good speech.

422
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:25,249
Didn't want to interrupt.

423
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,521
What is this?

424
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:32,356
What are you doing?

425
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:40,364
Let's go home.

426
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:44,703
<i>Come on.</i>

427
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:54,981
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

428
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,582
Why would I lie
about it?

429
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:59,351
To create strife between
my sister and me.

430
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:02,155
Where before there was
nothing but love.

431
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:06,625
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill
you on your sister's orders.

432
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,161
If it weren't for your
Squire's bravery,

433
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:11,830
you'd be a dead man.

434
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:15,600
- <i>Pod.</i>
- Yes, My Lord?

435
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:18,271
Would it be
excessive of me

436
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:20,974
to ask you to save
my life twice in a week?

437
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:23,243
No, My Lord.

438
00:29:23,277 --> 00:29:25,746
<i>You're a good lad.</i>

439
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,582
Get Bronn, tell him I want
four of his most loyal

440
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:30,552
Gold Cloaks outside
my door at all times.

441
00:29:30,586 --> 00:29:32,921
I'm afraid your friend
has been relieved

442
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:35,190
of his command
of the City Watch.

443
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:38,894
The Gold Cloaks are now firmly
in the hands of your father

444
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:40,662
or your sister.

445
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,499
It varies
from cloak to cloak.

446
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,502
- Then my hill tribesmen.
- Have gone home.

447
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,772
Your father paid them
quite handsomely.

448
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,745
I'm afraid we won't
be seeing each other

449
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:57,847
for some time, My Lord.

450
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:01,618
Don't want to swim too close
to a drowning man?

451
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:04,887
And I thought
we were friends.

452
00:30:04,921 --> 00:30:07,857
We are.

453
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,825
Podrick, would you mind?

454
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,709
There are many who know
that without you

455
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:31,380
this city faced
certain defeat.

456
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:33,582
<i>The King won't give</i>
<i>you any honors,</i>

457
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:36,118
<i>the histories</i>
<i>won't mention you,</i>

458
00:30:36,152 --> 00:30:39,354
but we will not forget.

459
00:30:41,825 --> 00:30:43,425
Come along now, Podrick.

460
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,967
My love.

461
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,601
It was good of you
to come.

462
00:30:51,636 --> 00:30:53,237
Good of me?

463
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:55,306
Of course I come.

464
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:02,012
- I want to see you.
- Believe me, you don't.

465
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:04,982
Have you looked?

466
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:07,917
I will be the first.

467
00:31:31,978 --> 00:31:33,645
Well?

468
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,649
You are a mess.

469
00:31:38,385 --> 00:31:41,053
I'm a monster
as well as a dwarf.

470
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:42,588
You should charge
me double.

471
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:44,356
You think I'm here
for money?

472
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,325
That was the arrangement
we made.

473
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:49,394
I pay you
and you lie to me.

474
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,963
Aw, I'm a poor
little rich man

475
00:31:51,998 --> 00:31:53,938
and nobody loves me,
so I make jokes all the time

476
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:55,517
and pay them to laugh.

477
00:31:56,068 --> 00:31:57,835
Fuck your money.

478
00:31:58,804 --> 00:31:59,904
Let's leave.

479
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:01,906
- Leave?
- Leave King's Landing.

480
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:04,476
They tried to kill you.
They will try again.

481
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,745
Going into wars,
fighting soldiers--

482
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,381
you're terrible at this.

483
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:12,552
Let's take a boat to Pentos
and never come back.

484
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:14,187
You don't belong here.

485
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:15,990
What would we do
in Pentos?

486
00:32:16,024 --> 00:32:18,759
Eat, drink,

487
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:21,061
fuck, live.

488
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:27,369
I want to go with you.

489
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,970
So do it.

490
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:31,239
Your father, your sister,
all these bad people,

491
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:33,041
they can't stop you.

492
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,510
Forget about them.
Come with me.

493
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,714
I can't.

494
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,583
I do belong here.

495
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,754
These bad people

496
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:47,422
are what I'm good at.

497
00:32:47,456 --> 00:32:49,858
Outtalking them,
outthinking them.

498
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:52,194
It's what I am.

499
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,432
And I like it.

500
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:59,868
I like it more than
anything I've ever done.

501
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,809
Are you going to leave?

502
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:14,917
You have a shit memory.

503
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:19,988
I am yours
and you are mine.

504
00:33:32,234 --> 00:33:34,836
In the sight
of the Seven,

505
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,907
I hereby seal
these two souls,

506
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:43,712
binding them as one
for eternity.

507
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:51,886
Look upon one another
and say the words.

508
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,524
Father, smith,

509
00:33:57,558 --> 00:33:59,525
warrior, mother,

510
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,096
maiden, crone,
stranger...

511
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,832
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

512
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:09,369
from this day
until the end of my days.

513
00:35:17,976 --> 00:35:20,177
Is this a riddle?

514
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:02,485
Khaleesi!

515
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:05,321
Khaleesi!

516
00:36:07,925 --> 00:36:10,293
<i>Khaleesi!</i>

517
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:16,198
Are you trying to frighten me
with magic tricks?

518
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:18,934
You want me?
Here I am.

519
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,037
Are you afraid
of a little girl?

520
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,796
<i>How did he find us?</i>

521
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:13,856
What are you doing here?

522
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,558
Waiting for you.

523
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:18,261
How did you know
we'd come this way?

524
00:37:18,295 --> 00:37:20,163
After all the things
you have seen,

525
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,198
this is your question?

526
00:37:22,232 --> 00:37:24,868
How did you
kill those guards?

527
00:37:24,902 --> 00:37:27,270
Was it hard?

528
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:30,039
No harder than taking a new name
if you know the way.

529
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:33,710
Show me how. I want
to be able to do it, too.

530
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:35,912
If you would learn,
you must come with me.

531
00:37:35,947 --> 00:37:37,513
Where?

532
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:40,750
Far and away across
the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

533
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:42,852
My dancing master
was from Braavos.

534
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:46,122
To be a dancing master
is a special thing,

535
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:48,758
but to be a faceless man--

536
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:50,727
that is something
else entirely.

537
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:53,964
A girl has many names
on her lips--

538
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:57,267
Joffrey, Cersei,
Tywin Lannister,

539
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:59,135
Ilyn Payne, the Hound.

540
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,606
Names to offer up
to the Red God.

541
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,442
She could offer them all
one by one.

542
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,713
I want to.

543
00:38:12,982 --> 00:38:15,650
But I can't.

544
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:18,787
I need to find
my brother and mother.

545
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:21,423
And my sister.

546
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:25,093
I need to find
her, too.

547
00:38:26,663 --> 00:38:28,563
Then we must part.

548
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:30,799
A man has duties as well.

549
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,268
Here.

550
00:38:32,302 --> 00:38:34,269
What is it?

551
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:37,306
A coin of great value.

552
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,775
Could it buy a horse?

553
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,745
It is not meant
for the buying of horses.

554
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,280
Then what good is it?

555
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:47,149
If the day comes when
you must find me again,

556
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:49,252
just give that coin
to any man from Braavos

557
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,020
and say these words to him,

558
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:53,056
"Valar Morghulis."

559
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,625
Valar Morghulis.

560
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:01,597
Please don't go, Jaqen.

561
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:06,970
Jaqen is dead.

562
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:09,973
Say it again.
Valar Morghulis.

563
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:13,310
Valar Morghulis.

564
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:15,312
Good.

565
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:24,521
Farewell, Arya Stark.

566
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,782
Osha, what are you doing?

567
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:17,934
Tell us what medicine
to get from your chambers.

568
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:20,704
- We'll make you better.
- I feel just fine.

569
00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:27,544
They burned it down.
They burned everything.

570
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:31,148
Not everything.
Not you.

571
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:35,886
But they may come back.
You have to go.

572
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,788
Put on your
warmest clothes.

573
00:41:37,822 --> 00:41:40,257
Pack as much food as you
can carry and go north.

574
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,126
North's the wrong way.

575
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,261
Their mother and brother
are south.

576
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:46,096
We don't know where.

577
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,932
There are too many enemies
in the South.

578
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,935
Go to the Wall
to Jon.

579
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:53,837
<i>He'll look after you and let your</i>
<i>mother know you're safe.</i>

580
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:56,808
I don't want to leave you.

581
00:41:56,843 --> 00:41:59,578
No more than I want
to leave you.

582
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:03,315
I pulled you
into the world.

583
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:04,883
Both of you.

584
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:08,355
I've seen both your faces
almost every day since.

585
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:13,560
And for that, I consider
myself very, very lucky.

586
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,396
Go now with Hodor.

587
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:18,498
<i>Go on.</i>

588
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:20,634
I'll be right here.

589
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,871
Hodor.

590
00:42:27,474 --> 00:42:30,109
Osha.

591
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:32,144
You must protect them.

592
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:34,880
You're the only one
who can.

593
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,285
You may have to protect
them against your own kind.

594
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,188
I've got no great love
for my own kind.

595
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:48,125
I'll get you milk
of the poppy.

596
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,994
Tell me where to find it.

597
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:52,729
I don't want
milk of the poppy.

598
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:04,675
Do it quickly.

599
00:48:56,931 --> 00:48:59,532
Until the sun
rises in the west

600
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:03,135
and sets in the east,

601
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:05,871
until the rivers run dry

602
00:49:05,905 --> 00:49:09,074
and the mountains blow
in the wind like leaves.

603
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,718
They miss their mother.

604
00:49:53,752 --> 00:49:56,153
They want to be with you.

605
00:49:56,188 --> 00:49:57,955
Do you want
to be with them?

606
00:49:57,989 --> 00:49:59,790
You will be.

607
00:49:59,825 --> 00:50:02,193
<i>When your dragons</i>
<i>were born,</i>

608
00:50:02,228 --> 00:50:04,229
our magic
was born again.

609
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:06,198
It is strongest
in their presence.

610
00:50:06,232 --> 00:50:10,135
And they are strongest
in yours.

611
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:13,205
You will be with them,

612
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,175
through winter, summer,

613
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,511
and winter again.

614
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:21,380
Across a thousand
thousand seasons

615
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:23,215
you will be with them.

616
00:50:23,249 --> 00:50:26,451
And we will be with you
until time comes to an end.

617
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:35,693
Welcome home,
Daenerys Stormborn.

618
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:37,828
This is not my home.

619
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:38,903
My home is across the sea

620
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:41,008
where my people
are waiting for me.

621
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:43,768
They will be waiting
a long time.

622
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,355
Dracarys.

623
00:51:51,205 --> 00:51:53,706
We should be there
by sundown.

624
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:55,441
Won't be a fun
night for you.

625
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:58,444
Mance knows how
to make crows sing.

626
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:02,489
If you know what to say,
you might just make it

627
00:52:02,514 --> 00:52:04,125
through the night.

628
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,789
Not talking's
not the way to go.

629
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:12,658
Careful with that.

630
00:52:12,692 --> 00:52:14,960
You might cut yourself.

631
00:52:14,995 --> 00:52:17,730
Never swung a sword
before, have you?

632
00:52:17,764 --> 00:52:19,532
You look like a baby
with a rattle.

633
00:52:19,566 --> 00:52:21,900
<i>Enough of that!</i>

634
00:52:31,478 --> 00:52:33,512
- Stop!
- Why, traitor?

635
00:52:33,546 --> 00:52:37,349
So you can give Mance Rayder
an invitation to Castle Black?

636
00:52:37,383 --> 00:52:39,584
Let 'em fight.

637
00:52:59,071 --> 00:53:01,506
That's it?
That's what you can do?

638
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,608
You little shit.

639
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:10,749
Your traitor father
teach you that?

640
00:53:14,254 --> 00:53:16,355
Or was it your whore mother?

641
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:38,510
We are the Watchers
on the Wall.

642
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:53,028
You can tell Mance

643
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:56,832
that's the man who killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

644
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,182
- Burn the body.
<i>- Aye.</i>

645
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,551
You don't want this one
coming back for you.

646
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,533
Come along, Jon Snow.

647
00:54:57,193 --> 00:55:00,228
Time to meet
the King-Beyond-The-Wall.

648
00:55:46,311 --> 00:55:48,445
What the--?

649
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,619
<i>Khaleesi, please.</i>

650
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,555
He said you'd never
leave Qarth alive.

651
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,790
Come.

652
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:33,290
Nothing.

653
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:43,867
Thank you,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

654
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,037
<i>Thank you for teaching</i>
<i>me this lesson.</i>

655
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,308
I am King of Qarth.

656
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:53,310
I can help you now,
truly help you.

657
00:56:53,344 --> 00:56:55,445
We can take
the Iron Throne.

658
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,681
- I'll bring you 1,000 ships.
- Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

659
00:56:57,715 --> 00:57:00,183
All that you have dreamed
is within your reach!

660
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:02,986
I beg you, please!

661
00:57:03,021 --> 00:57:05,889
- Khaleesi.
- Please! Please!

662
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:09,126
<i>- Khaleesi!</i>

663
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:30,214
It's all a lie.

664
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:32,550
Looks real enough to me.

665
00:57:36,822 --> 00:57:39,056
Real enough
to buy a ship?

666
00:57:40,425 --> 00:57:43,327
Aye, a small ship.

667
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:30,407
I thought we were coming
north to fight wildlings.

668
00:58:33,478 --> 00:58:35,845
Is this goat?

669
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,414
It's moose.

670
00:58:37,448 --> 00:58:39,549
People shouldn't
live anywhere

671
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,618
you need to burn shit
to keep warm.

672
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:45,789
Well, you see a tree,
let me know.

673
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,859
If you step back
and think about it,

674
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:52,262
the thing about Gilly
that's so interesting is--

675
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,564
- Just bloody kill me.
- No, truly.

676
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,801
The thing about her that
I find so interesting is that

677
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:00,370
after all that
Craster's done to her,

678
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:02,906
she's still got hope that
life might get better.

679
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,175
The thing about Gilly
that you find so interesting

680
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,978
is that she said
six words to you.

681
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:12,147
And the thing about you
that I find so interesting

682
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:14,149
is absolutely nothing.

683
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,120
It's Jon
and the Halfhand.

684
00:59:19,154 --> 00:59:21,989
They're back.

685
00:59:24,426 --> 00:59:27,295
Two blasts is wildlings.

686
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:29,363
You're not fighting them alone.
Come on.

687
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,271
Three blasts?

688
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:38,406
Run!

689
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,815
Wait! Wait for me!

690
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,654
Grenn!

691
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,057
<i>Edd!</i>
