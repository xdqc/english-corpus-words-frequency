It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

2

- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

3
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,573
Doesn't mean I'd pick
a bull in a fight.

4

If the bull had fangs
and claws, I would.

He's prettier than the queen.

How good could he be?

12

He's been stabbing

You'd have us surrender,

The country would be at peace

( Crowd murmuring )

158
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:24,705
Tell me the truth.

159
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,730
Do you want an end
to this engagement?

160
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:30,750
I am loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

161
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:39,091
Lady Stark, you may
survive us yet.

162
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:44,529
The little king's
backed up.

163
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:47,932
Clogged from balls
to brains.

164
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,668
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

165
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:53,671
There's no cure
for being a cunt.

166
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,973
But the boy's at that age.

167
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:59,710
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

168
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:02,280
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

169
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:12,023
What are you
doing here, dog?

170
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:14,392
Your uncle left
your nameday present

171
00:11:14,427 --> 00:11:16,894
and asked me to see
that you got it.

172
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:21,466
And?

173
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,601
What is it?

174
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:26,071
Look inside,
Your Grace.

175
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:34,913
Your Grace.

176
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:37,817
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

177

We won't tell
if you won't.

178
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,926
No.

179
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,728
Her.

180
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:52,133

186
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,574
Yes, Your Grace.

187
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:33,943
He chose us himself.

188
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:35,744

Now you do the Lannisters'

214
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,669
Tell me, was my brother's

before you secured
your newest patron?

216
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:21,274
I'm a practical man.

217
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,577

218

<i>And who would you have</i>

( Chuckles )

221
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,718
I don't like you,
Lord Baelish.

222
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:36,087
I don't like your face.

223
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:39,524
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

224
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:43,128
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

225
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:46,364
So tell me,
why are you here?

226
00:15:47,366 --> 00:15:49,368
Renly:
<i>You can trust Brienne.</i>

227
00:15:49,402 --> 00:15:51,903
Her loyalty comes
without charge.

228
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:57,108
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

229
00:15:57,143 --> 00:16:00,546
many who believe
Ned Stark erred

230
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,715
by not supporting
your claim.

231
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:06,886
Now I understand.

232
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,822
You know I have
the numbers.

233
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,625
You know I'm marching
on King's Landing.

234
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:14,827
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

235
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,264
And your head.

236
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:21,266
I would give priority
to my head.

237
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,768
<i>I understand that</i>
<i>you don't like me,</i>

238
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:26,137
and while that
saddens me greatly,

239
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:28,806
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

240
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,342
<i>When you march</i>
<i>on King's Landing,</i>

241
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,779
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

242
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:39,016
open gates.

243
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,435
Your Grace.

244
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,405
Lord Baelish.

245
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,575
All of these tents
look the same to me.

246
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,944
- Would you be so kind--
- It would be my pleasure.

247
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:09,813
It took me weeks to learn
way around the camp.

248
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:12,883
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

249
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:15,586
And the moment I learn
which tent is mine,

250
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,322
we're on the move again.

251
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,989
Your tent?

252
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:21,159
Not our tent?

253
00:17:21,193 --> 00:17:23,561
The King snores, perhaps?

254
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:26,698
Or simply prefers
solitude?

255
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:29,602
Pressures of command,
no doubt.

256
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,338
Four kings vying
for the throne.

257
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,740
I am not tutored
in warfare,

258
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:38,444
but basic arithmetic favors the
side with the greater numbers.

259
00:17:38,446 --> 00:17:40,083
If war were arithmetic,

260
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:42,262
the mathematicians
would rule the world.

261
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,586
But I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent the just now.

262
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,821
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

263
00:17:48,856 --> 00:17:50,890
And on the night
of the your wedding,

264
00:17:50,925 --> 00:17:53,660
who was by
the King's side then?

265
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,896
You seem quite interested
in our marriage.

266
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,499
Your marriage
is quite interesting...

267
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:01,636
Not only to me,
but to the realm.

268
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,773
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest,

269
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,942
if nothing else.

270
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:08,877
You've never married,
have you?

271
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:13,282
I've been unlucky
in my affections, sadly.

272
00:18:13,316 --> 00:18:15,718
That is sad.

273
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:17,519
Though perhaps
it's for the best.

274
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:19,821
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

275
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:22,057
so allow me to explain.

276
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:26,528
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

277
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:30,098

Only that the desert

the Garden of Nes.

Ilyn Payne.

319
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:53,971
The Hound.

320
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:57,207
Joffrey. Cersei.

321
00:21:57,242 --> 00:22:00,277
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

322
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:05,849
How dare you?

323
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:07,751
You may have heard
false reports.

324
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,288
- You betrayed Ned.
- <i>Betrayed?</i>

325
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,256
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

326
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,825
I begged him
to seize the moment.

327
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:17,963
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.

328
00:22:17,997 --> 00:22:21,266
And you repaid our faith
with treachery.

329
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,601
- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

330
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:24,804
Cat, I've--

331
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:27,473
I've loved you
since I was a boy.

332
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:31,411
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance--

333
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:34,847
Have you lost your mind?
Get out!

334
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:50,461
Do you want to see
your girls again?

335
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,300
Sansa, more beautiful
than ever.

336
00:22:56,335 --> 00:23:00,372
And Arya,
just as wild as ever.

337
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,608
You have Arya, too?

338
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:06,712
Both girls are healthy
and safe...

339
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:09,749
<i>for now.</i>

340
00:23:09,783 --> 00:23:13,586
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

341
00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:16,555
I fear for
their longevity

342
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,791
if they remain
in the capital.

343
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,608
<i>( Knife clinks )</i>

344
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,047
What do you want?

345
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,720
The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

346
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,321
Of course they will.

347
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:51,025
Jaime Lannister
for two girls?

348
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,627
Robb will never agree
to those terms.

349
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:54,963
I'm not bringing
these terms to him.

350
00:23:54,997 --> 00:23:56,864
I'm bringing them
to you.

351
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:59,500
You think I'd keep
secrets from my son?

352
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:02,437
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

353
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:04,405
but he's not a mother.

354
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,274
<i>Consider it, Cat.</i>

355
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:10,044
<i>You may not get</i>
<i>another chance.</i>

356
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:16,984
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

357
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:20,321
A token of Tyrion
Lannister's goodwill.

358
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:24,492
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

359
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:26,628
is offered in good faith.

360
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:28,596
Good faith?

361
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:34,402
What's this?

362
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:07,034
Your husband was
an honorable man.

363
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:10,772
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

364
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,579
- You may not believe--
- Get out.

365
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:42,035

The Mountain.

370

What are you doing?

371
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:15,901
He told me he stares
at him every day.

372
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:18,404
That's why he
doesn't get picked.

373
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:45,665
You.

374
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,435
Man:
<i>Move, boy!</i>

375
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,938

- <i>Gems?</i>

379
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:16,364
I didn't see any.

Which of the villagers

Please. Please, stop.

- and his son.
- That's better.

396

Woman: <i>Please, Polliver.</i>
<i>Some food.</i>

405

Just a crust of bread.

<i>( Woman crying )</i>

The Mountain.

409
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:08,643
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

410
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:12,246
I had not thought
to be here, Lord Stannis.

411
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,649
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

412
00:29:15,684 --> 00:29:18,419
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

413
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:20,988
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

414
00:29:21,023 --> 00:29:23,591
I suppose if we used
the same one,

415
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,394
the battle would be
terribly confusing.

<i>Why is your stag</i>
<i>on fire?</i>

417
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:31,500
The King has taken
for his sigil

418
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,536
the fiery heart
of the Lord of Light.

419
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:38,007
Ah, you must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

420
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,243
<i>Mm, brother,</i>

421
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:43,546
now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

422
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,015
Watch yourself, Renly.

423
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:48,085
Renly:
<i>No, no, I'm relieved.</i>

424
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,287
I never really believed
you're a fanatic.

425
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,657
Charmless, rigid,
a bore, yes,

426
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,493
but not a godly man.

427
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,231
You should kneel before your borther,
he's the Lord's chosen,

428
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,601
<i>born amidst salt</i>
<i>and smoke.</i>

429
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:04,803
Born amidst salt

430
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,105
Is he a ham?

431
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,074
Stannis: <i>That's twice</i>
<i>I've warned you.</i>

432
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:10,009
Listen to yourselves.

433
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:13,279
If you were sons of mine, I
would knock your heads together

434
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:14,981
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered

435
00:30:15,006 --> 00:30:16,616
that you were brothers.

436
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,318
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

437
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:22,154
<i>Your husband was a supporter</i>
<i>of my claim.</i>

438
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,223
Lord Eddard's integrity
cost him his head.

439
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:27,292
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

440
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,994
We share a common enemy.

441
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:32,731
The Iron Throne
is mine by right.

442
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:36,201
All those that deny that
are my foes.

443
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:39,471
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

444
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,240
Old men deny it
with their death rattle

445
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:44,143
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

446
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,380
No one wants you
for their King.

447
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:51,616
<i>You never wanted</i>
<i>any friends, brother.</i>

448
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,085
<i>But a man without friends</i>
<i>is a man without power.</i>

449
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,655
For the sake of the mother
who bore us,

450
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,058
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

451
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,694
Strike your banners,

452
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,329
come to me before dawn,

453
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,265
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

454
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,235
I'll even name you
my heir

455
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,104
until a son
is born to me.

456
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,442
Otherwise I shall
destroy you.

457
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,881
Look across
those fields, brother.

458
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,551
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>all those banners?</i>

459
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,321
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you King?

460
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:31,523
No.

461
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,694
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

462
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,596
We shall see, Renly.

463
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,366
Come the dawn,
we shall see.

464
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,568
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

465
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:44,104
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

466
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:53,212
Would you believe
I loved him once?

467
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,602
I thought we were welcome.

468
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:18,505
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

469
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,573
you might do the same,
Khaleesi.

470
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:24,977
Horde?

471
00:32:39,693 --> 00:32:41,727
My name is Daenerys--

472
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:44,997
Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen.

473
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:47,066
You know me, My Lord?

474
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,736
Only by reputation,
Khaleesi.

475
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,306
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

476
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:57,044
They call you
the Mother of Dragons.

477
00:32:57,078 --> 00:32:59,046
And what should
I call you?

478
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,648
Oh, my name is quite long

479
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:03,251
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

480
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:06,889
I am simply a trader
of spices.

481
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:10,259
But we are the Thirteen,

482
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:13,630
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

483
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:17,367
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

484
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:21,202
The beauty of
Quarth is legendary--

485
00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:23,227
Qarth.

486
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:26,309
Qarth.

487
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:29,379
Might we see
the dragons?

488
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:37,387
My friend,

489
00:33:37,422 --> 00:33:39,856
we have travelled
very far.

490
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,391
<i>We have no food,</i>
<i>no water.</i>

491
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:44,893
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

492
00:33:44,928 --> 00:33:47,763
Forgive me,
Mother of Dragons,

493
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:51,800
but no man alive has seen
a living dragon.

494
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:54,002
Some of my more
skeptical friends

495
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:57,472
refuse to believe
your children

496
00:33:57,506 --> 00:33:59,407
even exist.

497
00:33:59,442 --> 00:34:02,844
<i>All we ask is the chance</i>
<i>to see for ourselves.</i>

498
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:04,846
I am not a liar.

499
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,915
Oh, I don't think you are.

500
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:08,650
But as I've never
met you before,

501
00:34:08,684 --> 00:34:11,887
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

502
00:34:13,423 --> 00:34:15,858
Where I come from,

503
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,360
guests are treated
with respect,

504
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:21,697
not insulted
at the gates.

505
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:24,232
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

506
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,468
We wish you well.

507
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:31,874
What are you doing?

508
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:34,709
You promised
to receive me.

509
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:37,212
We have received you.

510
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:39,948
Here we are,
and here you are.

511
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:43,886
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

512
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,622
Which we shall
deeply regret.

513
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,727
But Qarth did not become

514
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,872
the greatest city that
ever was or will be

515
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:53,563
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

516
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:02,672
Khaleesi, please
be careful.

517
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:08,111
Thirteen!

518
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:10,647
When my dragons are grown,

519
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:13,783
we will take back
what was stolen from me

520
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:16,152
and destroy those
who have wronged me.

521
00:35:16,187 --> 00:35:18,655
We will lay waste
to armies

522
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:21,390
and burn cities
to the ground.

523
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:25,394
Turn us away and we will
burn you first.

524
00:35:25,429 --> 00:35:27,596
Ah.

525
00:35:27,631 --> 00:35:30,399
You are a true
Targaryen.

526
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:33,569
Only, as you said
a moment ago,

527
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:35,204
if we don't let you
into the city,

528
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,740
you will all die.
And so...

529
00:35:37,774 --> 00:35:40,409
Retreating in fear
from a little girl

530
00:35:40,443 --> 00:35:42,611
is unbecoming
of the greatest city

531
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:44,213
that ever was
or will be.

532
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:47,784
The discussion is over,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

533
00:35:47,818 --> 00:35:49,819
The Thirteen have spoken.

534
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:52,589
I am one of the Thirteen

535
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:55,058
and I am still speaking.

536
00:35:55,092 --> 00:35:57,427
The girl threatens to burn
our city to the ground

537
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:00,630
and you would invite her in
for a cup of wine?

538
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:02,732
She is the Mother
of Dragons.

539
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:06,068
Do you expect her to watch
her people starve

540
00:36:06,102 --> 00:36:08,203
without breathing fire?

541
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:10,806
<i>I believe we can allow</i>
<i>a few Dothraki</i>

542
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,408
<i>through our gates</i>
<i>without dooming our city.</i>

543
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:16,746
<i>After all, here I am,</i>

544
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,848
a savage from
the Summer Isles,

545
00:36:18,882 --> 00:36:20,751
and Qarth still stands.

546
00:36:20,818 --> 00:36:23,687
Our decision is final.

547
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:25,857
Very well.

548
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:30,729
I invoke <i>Soumai.</i>

549
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,234
<i>I will vouch for her,</i>
<i>her people,</i>

550
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:40,637
<i>and her dragons</i>
<i>in accordance with the law.</i>

551
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:48,644
Be it on your head.

552
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:53,014
Welcome to Qarth,
My Lady.

553
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:44,933
Mountain:
<i>You.</i>

554
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:55,811
Tickler: Is there gold or silver
in the village?

555
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:58,747
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

556
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:01,383
I don't know
what that is.

557
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:09,892
( Squeaking )

558
00:38:15,164 --> 00:38:17,065
( Horses neigh )

559
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:34,951
Man: <i>You two, take Lord Lannister's</i>
<i>things to his quarters.</i>

560
00:38:34,986 --> 00:38:36,586
What's this?

561
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:39,289
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

562
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:41,959
( Chuckles )
Evidently not.

563
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:45,796
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

564
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,199
Mountain: <i>Cells are overflowing,</i>
<i>My Lord.</i>

565
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:49,834
Polliver:
<i>This lot won't be here long.</i>

566
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:52,270
<i>Don't need</i>
<i>no permanent place.</i>

567
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:55,307
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

568
00:38:55,341 --> 00:38:59,678
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

569
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,515
able young bodies
and skilled laborers?

570
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,729
You,
do you have a trade?

571
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:17,565
Gendry:
<i>Smith, My Lord.</i>

572
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:21,436
What are you looking at?
Kneel!

573
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:26,274
Kneel or I'll carve
your lungs out, boy.

574
00:39:26,308 --> 00:39:28,609
He'll do no such thing.

575
00:39:28,643 --> 00:39:32,346
This one's a girl,
you idiot,

576
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,747
dressed as a boy.

577
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,850
- Why?
- Safer to travel, My Lord.

578
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:38,985
Smart.

579
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:40,887
More than I can say
for this lot.

580
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:43,590
Get these prisoners
to work.

581
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,558
Bring the girl.

582
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:47,660
I need a new
cupbearer.

583
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,296
Mountain:
<i>My Lord.</i>

584
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,098
<i>( Knocking on door )</i>

585
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:58,706
Your visits
are too few, cousin.

586
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:00,341
Her Grace,
the Queen Regent,

587
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,744
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

588
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:06,114
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

589
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:08,517
Will you take
a cup with me?

590
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:11,020
I find that mulled wine
helps me sleep.

591
00:40:11,087 --> 00:40:13,055
<i>I am here</i>
<i>at Her Grace's behest,</i>

592
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:15,257
not to drink
with you, Imp.

593
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:18,160
If my sister was
so concerned for Pycelle,

594
00:40:18,194 --> 00:40:20,395
<i>I would have thought</i>
<i>she'd come herself.</i>

595
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,463
Instead she sends you.

596
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:23,931
What am I to make
of that?

597
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:26,000
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what you make of it,</i>

598
00:40:26,034 --> 00:40:28,068
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

599
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:32,206
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

600
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,508
As I said several times.

601
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:37,445
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

602
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,679
When the Queen Regent
gives me a command, I carry

603
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:41,704
it out without delay.

604
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,755
Cersei must have
great trust in you,

605
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:48,991
<i>allowing you</i>
<i>into her chamber</i>

606
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:51,894
during the hour
of the wolf.

607
00:40:55,899 --> 00:40:58,701
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

608
00:40:58,735 --> 00:41:00,336
She often works
from dusk till dawn.

609
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,704
She must be very glad
to have you helping her

610
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:05,073
from dusk till dawn.

611
00:41:05,107 --> 00:41:08,108
Ah, lavender oil.

612
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:10,678
She always loved lavender oil,
even as a girl.

613
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:12,346
I am a knight!

614
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:15,149
An anointed knight, yes.

615
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:17,752
Tell me, did Cersei
have you knighted

616
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:21,356
before or after she took
you into her bed?

617
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,026
What?
Nothing to say?

618
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,961
No more warnings
for me, Ser?

619
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:27,930
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations.

620
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:29,532
Have you ever given
any thought

621
00:41:29,566 --> 00:41:31,467
to what King Joffrey
will have to say

622
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:34,904
when he finds out you've
been bedding his mother?

623
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:40,376
It's not my fault!

624
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,078
Did she take you
against your will?

625
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:45,113
Can you not defend
yourself, knight?

626
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:48,383
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

627
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,352
he told me to obey her
in everything.

628
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:52,253
Did he tell you
to fuck her, too?

629
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:55,523
I only meant
I did as I was bid.

630
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,325
Hated every
moment of it,

631
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
is that what you'll
have me believe?

632
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:01,430
A high place in court,
a knighthood,

633
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:03,699
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

634
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:06,068
Oh, yes, it must
have been terrible.

635
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:08,104
Wait here. His Grace will want
to hear this.

636
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:10,407
Mercy!
Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

637
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:12,042
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

638
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:13,797
My Lord, it was
your sister's bidding--

639
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,912
the Queen.

640
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:16,780
I'll leave the city
at once, I swear.

641
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:20,017
- No, I think not.
- My Lord?

642
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:22,018
You heard me.

643
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,097
My father told you
to obey my sister.

644
00:42:27,122 --> 00:42:28,558
Obey her.

645
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,928
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.

646
00:42:31,962 --> 00:42:34,030
Pleasure her
whenever she requires.

647
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:36,132
No one ever need know

648
00:42:36,166 --> 00:42:39,602
as long as you keep
faith with me.

649
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:43,104
I want to know
what Cersei is doing,

650
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,007
where she goes,
who she sees,

651
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,442
what they talk of--
everything.

652
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:50,477
And you will tell me.

653
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:52,880
Yes, My Lord, I will.

654
00:42:52,914 --> 00:42:55,215
I swear it,
as you command.

655
00:42:58,486 --> 00:43:00,787
Oh, rise, rise.

656
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:03,991
Let us drink to
our understanding.

657
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:06,560
Oh, you don't have
a cup. Oh, well.

658
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:09,664
Smile, cousin. My sister
is a beautiful woman.

659
00:43:09,698 --> 00:43:11,332
And it's all for
the good of the realm.

660
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:13,968
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

661
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:16,070
that I want no more
conflict between us

662
00:43:16,104 --> 00:43:17,848
and that henceforth

663
00:43:17,873 --> 00:43:19,841
I shall do nothing
without her consent.

664
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:21,142
But her demands.

665
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:23,811
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

666
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:26,080
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

667
00:43:26,115 --> 00:43:28,049
<i>Cersei can keep him</i>
<i>as a pet if she wants,</i>

668
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,084
<i>but I will not have him</i>
<i>on the council.</i>

669
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:32,954
I could swear that I had not
harmed a single hair on his head,

670
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:36,491
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

671
00:43:42,465 --> 00:43:45,433
<i>( Wood creaking )</i>

672
00:43:45,468 --> 00:43:47,068
<i>( Waves crashing )</i>

673
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:50,771
Man: <i>Stay within</i>
<i>one table length.</i>

674
00:43:55,444 --> 00:43:57,745
Your Grace.

675
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:04,618
Do your knucklebones
bring you luck?

676
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:10,523
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

677
00:44:10,558 --> 00:44:12,959
And it's four less
fingernails to clean.

678
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:15,528
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

679
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,498
Four fewer
fingernails to clean.

680
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:21,868
Never understood
why you had to wear them.

681
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:24,871
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

682
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:27,942
It reminds me
of your justice.

683
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:29,477
It was an honest
punishment

684
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:31,046
and you were good
with the cleaver.

685
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,748
You were a hero
and a smuggler.

686
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:37,218
A good act does not
wash out the bad,

687
00:44:37,252 --> 00:44:40,120
nor a bad the good.

688
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:42,623
A lesson I've tried
to teach my son.

689
00:44:42,657 --> 00:44:44,758
- Does he listen?
- To me?

690
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:47,461
Gods, no.

691
00:44:47,495 --> 00:44:50,263
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest--

692
00:44:50,298 --> 00:44:52,599
She has a name.

693
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:58,004
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

694
00:45:00,308 --> 00:45:02,343
I've lived within
the law for 17--

695
00:45:02,377 --> 00:45:04,778
I want you to be
a smuggler this time.

696
00:45:04,813 --> 00:45:07,381
Any shore, any night.

697
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:09,150
What am I bringing
ashore?

698
00:45:09,185 --> 00:45:11,019
The red woman.

699
00:45:12,722 --> 00:45:14,890
No one must know
what you do

700
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,525
and we'll not speak
of this again.

701
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,095
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be,

702
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,098
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

703
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,567
Cleaner ways
don't win wars.

704
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:58,269
Are you afraid,
onion knight?

705
00:46:00,506 --> 00:46:01,755
Someone once told me

706
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,178
the night is dark and
full of terrors.

707
00:46:05,877 --> 00:46:08,579
You've carried more
unpleasant cargo in your time.

708
00:46:12,483 --> 00:46:15,419
Are you a good man,
Ser Davos Seaworth?

709
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:17,413
I'd say my parts
are mixed, My Lady--

710
00:46:18,238 --> 00:46:19,323
good and bad.

711
00:46:19,324 --> 00:46:21,826
If half an onion
is black with rot,

712
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,761
it's a rotten onion.

713
00:46:23,796 --> 00:46:26,498
A man is good
or he is evil.

714
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:28,399
- And which are you?
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

715
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:31,736
I'm a knight myself
of sorts,

716
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:34,606
a champion of light
and life.

717
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,809
Well, that must be
very nice for you.

718
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:58,199
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

719
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:00,535
Yet you have known
other women.

720
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:02,403
Don't talk about my wife.

721
00:47:02,437 --> 00:47:06,407
I'm not. I'm talking about
other women.

722
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:08,809
Like me, Ser Davos.

723
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:14,982
You want me.

724
00:47:15,017 --> 00:47:17,985
You want to see
what's beneath this robe.

725
00:47:19,588 --> 00:47:21,789
And you will.

726
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:29,365
Strange that
this Lord of Light

727
00:47:29,399 --> 00:47:32,268
asks you to work
in the shadows.

728
00:47:32,302 --> 00:47:35,571
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

729
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:38,107
They are servants
of light,

730
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,576
the children of fire.

731
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:44,046
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

732
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,915
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

733
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,383
( Chuckles )

734
00:47:48,418 --> 00:47:50,685
They can't bar
our passage.

735
00:47:56,092 --> 00:47:57,626
Gods protect us.

736
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,163
There's only one God,
Ser Davos,

737
00:48:01,197 --> 00:48:03,899
and he only protects
those who serve him.
