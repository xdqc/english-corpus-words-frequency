1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:13,124
<i>Gotta be ready</i>
<i>before nightfall.</i>

2
00:02:14,126 --> 00:02:16,527
Okay, keep moving.

3
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,634
<i>Put a watch</i>
<i>on the Ridge</i>

4
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:24,836
<i>and the tree lines.</i>

5
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,574
<i>Boy.</i>

6
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:31,011
Lovely boy.

7
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:32,813
What do you want?

8
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:34,381
A man has a thirst.

9
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:37,551
A man does not drink
for a day and a night.

10
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,652
A boy could
make a friend.

11
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:42,054
I have friends.

12
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:44,290
Give us beer
before I skin you.

13
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:47,393
A man does not choose
his companions.

14
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:49,328
These two, they have
no courtesy.

15
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:51,697
A man must ask
forgiveness.

16
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,568
You're called Arry?

17
00:02:58,705 --> 00:03:01,941
This man has the honor
to be Jaqen H'ghar,

18
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,476
once of the free city of--

19
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,145
Beer, you little shit.

20
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:07,714
Get us beer!

21
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:09,516
You should have
asked nicely.

22
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,684
Aah!

23
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:17,926
Come closer
and I'll shove that stick

24
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,629
up your bunghole
and fuck you bloody.

25
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:23,198
A boy has more courage
than sense.

26
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:24,800
Come here!

27
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,535
Yoren said none of us
were to go near those three.

28
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,637
- Come here!
- They don't scare me.

29
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:30,739
Hmm?
Then you're stupid.

30
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:32,641
They scare me.

31
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:39,747
What are Gold Cloaks doing so
far from King's Landing?

32
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:47,420
- What are you doing?
- They're looking for me.

33
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:50,356
You in command here?

34
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:53,326
You're a long way
from home.

35
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,462
I asked you a question.

36
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:57,264
Aye, you did.

37
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,368
You asked
without manners

38
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:02,971
and I chose not to answer.

39
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:06,041
I have a royal warrant

40
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:09,712
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

41
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:15,218
Well, the thing is...

42
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:17,520
These gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch.

43
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:21,324
<i>Now, that puts them beyond the</i>
<i>reach of Kings and Queens.</i>

44
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,193
Does it?

45
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:25,595
<i>It's a funny thing--</i>

46
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,764
people worry so much
about their throats

47
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:31,168
that they forget
about what's down low.

48
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:35,406
Now I sharpened this blade
before breakfast.

49
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,810
I could shave a spider's arse
if I wanted to

50
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,815
or I could nick
this artery in your leg.

51
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:46,418
And once it's nicked,
there's no one around here

52
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,521
who knows
how to unnick it.

53
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,357
We'll just keep that.

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,396
Good steel is always
needed on the Wall.

55
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,130
Seems you have
a choice--

56
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:03,368
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

57
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:06,237
or you can go back to your city
and tell your Masters

58
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:09,273
you didn't find
what you were looking for.

59
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,115
We're looking
for a boy named Gendry.

60
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,719
<i>He carries</i>
<i>a bull's head helmet.</i>

61
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,757
<i>Anyone turning him over</i>
<i>will earn the King's reward.</i>

62
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,760
We'll be back
with more men

63
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,629
and I'll be taking your head
home along with that bastard boy.

64
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:02,259
- <i>( Distant seagulls</i>

65
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:07,732
My Lord.

66
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,733
You make me wait
a long time,

67
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,003
but your friend
keeps me company.

68
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:15,106
We were just speaking
of your bravery

69
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,542
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

70
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,979
It was quite a battle.

71
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:25,482
I heard you suffered
a terrible head wound.

72
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:28,452
The northerners
are such fearsome warriors.

73
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:31,089
And I tell him
the story of how we meet.

74
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,158
To find so lovely
a creature

75
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,994
working in your
father's kitchens--

76
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,263
it almost beggars belief.

77
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,334
Strange things do happen.

78
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:44,137
You should taste
her fish pie.

79
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,506
I don't think Lord Varys
likes fish pie.

80
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,509
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

81
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:51,745
<i>Men like Lord Varys</i>
<i>and I can't let</i>

82
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,947
our disadvantages
get the best of us.

83
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,849
We'll make a fisherman
of him yet.

84
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,750
I am glad
your new friend

85
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,886
was able to accompany you
to the capital.

86
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,990
Friends are such
an important part of life.

87
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,492
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

88
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:11,061
<i>But rest easy, My Lord.</i>

89
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:14,065
I am very good
at keeping secrets

90
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,300
for my good friends.

91
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,803
Your discretion
is legendary...

92
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,237
where your friends
are concerned.

93
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,740
How unspeakable of me
to go on and on

94
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,009
when all you want
to do is rest.

95
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,178
I will leave you.

96
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,348
Welcome to King's Landing,
my dear.

97
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,819
This city is made brighter
by your presence.

98
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,188
We have a council meeting,
My Lord.

99
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,027
I don't like threats.

100
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,330
- Who threatened you?
- I'm not Ned Stark.

101
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,498
I understand the way
this game is played.

102
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,133
Ned Stark
was a man of honor.

103
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,601
And I am not.

104
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,138
Threaten me again and I'll have
you thrown into the sea.

105
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,577
You might be disappointed
in the results.

106
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,580
Storms come and go,

107
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,782
the big fish eat
the little fish,

108
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,851
and I keep on paddling.

109
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,287
Come, My Lord.

110
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,689
We shouldn't keep
the queen waiting.

111
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,729
<i>"From this time</i>
<i>until the end of time,</i>

112
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,597
<i>we are not part</i>
<i>of your realm,</i>

113
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:25,501
but a free and independent
kingdom of the North."

114
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:31,706
He has more spirit than
his father, I'll give him that.

115
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,043
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

116
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:37,579
We can give him his father's bones
back at least

117
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:39,314
as a gesture
of good faith.

118
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:41,383
You'll give the Starks
our reply, cousin?

119
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,486
I will, Your Grace.

120
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,122
Did you see my brother

121
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:47,557
when you were
the Starks' guest?

122
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,492
<i>I did.</i>

123
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:52,228
<i>They have not broken</i>
<i>his spirit, Your Grace.</i>

124
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,965
If you speak with him,

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,901
tell him he's not
been forgotten.

126
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:01,270
- I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

127
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,910
You have a deft hand
with diplomacy.

128
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:12,181
- If that's everything...
- A-- a raven flew in this morning

129
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:15,084
from Castle Black.

130
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:16,719
Trouble with
the wildlings.

131
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:19,221
That's why they're
called "wildlings."

132
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:21,890
Somewhat less wild
these days.

133
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,726
Seems they've stopped
killing each other

134
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,863
and started following
this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

135
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:29,699
Another king?
How many is that now, five?

136
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,501
I've lost count.

137
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:35,338
The Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man the Wall.

138
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,040
Perhaps he's forgotten
we're fighting a war.

139
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:39,042
We have no men to spare.

140
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:40,778
"The cold winds
are rising

141
00:09:40,812 --> 00:09:43,381
and the dead rise
with them."

142
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:47,018
The northerners are
a superstitious people.

143
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:49,120
According to the Commander,
one of these dead men

144
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,190
attacked him
in his chambers.

145
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,225
Mormont doesn't lie.

146
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,895
<i>How do you kill</i>
<i>a dead man?</i>

147
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,864
Apparently you burn him.

148
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,834
One trip to the Wall
and you come back

149
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:05,204
believing in grumpkins
and snarks.

150
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,774
I don't know
what I believe,

151
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,875
but here's
a fact for you--

152
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,510
<i>the Night's Watch</i>
<i>is the only thing</i>

153
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:15,212
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

154
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,648
I have every confidence
that the brave men

155
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,385
of the Night's Watch
will protect us all.

156
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,588
<i>And I said,</i>

157
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,289
"if the Gods wanted us
to have dignity,

158
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,192
they wouldn't make us
fart when we died."

159
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:31,928
We fart when we die?

160
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:33,897
My blessed mother--

161
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,999
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

162
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:39,602
She farted so hard,
the whole bed shook.

163
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:52,714
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

164
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,217
Wouldn't two or three
be enough for him?

165
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:58,154
We were having
a serious discussion.

166
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,391
Would you look at that?

167
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,630
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

168
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,533
I prefer watching them
come towards me.

169
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,168
I'm sure
that's nice, too.

170
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,337
Yeah, well, there was
a milkmaid named Violet

171
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:15,940
on the next farm over
from where I grew up.

172
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,942
<i>We were wrestling together</i>
<i>from the time we were six years old.</i>

173
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:23,947
And then we got older
and the wrestling, uh...

174
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,183
Changed.

175
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:29,051
You were with her?

176
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,687
How many times?

177
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:34,223
Well, as many times
as I could.

178
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:40,029
I wish I grew up
on a farm.

179
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:41,398
We need more potatoes.

180
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:43,800
Get another sack
from the sledge.

181
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,306
Get the turnips, too.

182
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:04,320
No. Ghost, no.

183
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:06,789
<i>No!</i>

184
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:09,391
Ghost, away.
Shoo, shoo!

185
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,297
You all right?

186
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:18,134
- Did he frighten you?
- You-- you shouldn't touch me.

187
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:21,738
Oh. Oh, right.

188
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:23,407
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,210
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't hurt.

190
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,252
You're very brave.

191
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:46,597
What are you doing?

192
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,431
This is Gilly.

193
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,867
She's one of Craster's...
daughters.

194
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,750
Hello, Gilly.
What are you doing?

195
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:54,443
Sam said
you could help.

196
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,112
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed--

197
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:57,337
She's pregnant.

198
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,653
Have to take her
with us when we leave.

199
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,488
What?

200
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,323
- What would that--
I know it sounds a bit mad.

201
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:13,091
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

202
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,460
- The Lord Commander ordered us to--
- We are sworn to protect.

203
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,062
- Sam, we can't take--
- please, ser, please.

204
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,997
I can still run
if I have to.

205
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,433
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

206
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:25,035
If it's a boy...

207
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,003
If it's a boy, what?

208
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:34,377
You want us to risk
our lives for you

209
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,513
and you won't even
tell us why?

210
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:45,155
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

211
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:46,990
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

212
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,992
Sam, are you in such a hurry
to lose a hand?

213
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,361
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

214
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,130
What do you think
Craster cuts off for that?

215
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:55,165
I can't steal her.

216
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,467
She's a person,
not a goat.

217
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:05,843
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

218
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:08,680
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

219
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,616
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

220
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,518
Who's going to
deliver a baby, you?

221
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,722
I could try.

222
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:19,691
What?
I've read about it.

223
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,327
A bit.

224
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,132
I'm sorry, Sam.

225
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,067
We can't help her.

226
00:15:23,526 --> 00:15:26,695
Khaleesi.

227
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:13,677
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

228
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:20,451
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

229
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:22,820
<i>Khal Jhaqo.</i>

230
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:25,923
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a Khalasar.

231
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,192
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

232
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,286
Is it as you remember,
My Lord?

233
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,521
It looks smaller.

234
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:07,389
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

235
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,324
I remember
my father's cabin

236
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,159
felt like a palace
when I was little.

237
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:14,696
Now look at it.

238
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,998
They'll be waiting
for me on the docks.

239
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:18,800
Who will?

240
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,668
<i>Anyone who matters.</i>

241
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,870
This is a big day for them.

242
00:18:22,905 --> 00:18:26,407
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

243
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,509
It's a hard place,
the Iron Islands.

244
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:30,078
<i>Always has been.</i>

245
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:32,347
It's cold and it's wet.

246
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,116
Oh, I love
the cold and wet.

247
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,718
They say hard places
breed hard men.

248
00:18:38,421 --> 00:18:40,956
And hard men
rule the world.

249
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:45,460
Then you'll be king
before long.

250
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:51,266
Try smiling with
your lips closed.

251
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,434
Better.

252
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:58,773
My father doesn't trust
you Iron islanders.

253
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,775
I don't blame him.

254
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,812
<i>He says that you're all</i>
<i>reavers and rapers</i>

255
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:05,680
and that no matter
how many women you have,

256
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,715
you'll never be sat-- uh!

257
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,018
Quit talking about your father.

258
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:13,855
But he's right
about us.

259
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:17,591
Our wives from the Iron Islands,
they're for breeding.

260
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:19,994
That's not enough for us.

261
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,496
That's why
we take salt wives--

262
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,098
the women we capture.

263
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,633
Capture me.

264
00:19:25,668 --> 00:19:27,768
Take me with you
when you go ashore.

265
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:31,940
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

266
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:34,108
Not after you leave.

267
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:36,477
Father will punish me.

268
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,112
He'll call me a whore.

269
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,683
I haven't paid you.

270
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:56,265
Oh, yeah.

271
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:08,411
<i>- I paid good money...</i>

272
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:20,256
I'm not going to stand for this.

273
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,991
I barely touched her.

274
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:24,227
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

275
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:26,128
and this is
what I get-- crying.

276
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:28,498
One moment, my friend.
A moment.

277
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:40,210
Please accept
my sincerest apologies.

278
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:42,612
Aremca will take
good care of you.

279
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:17,147
- I'm sorry, My Lord.
- Shh, shh.

280
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,217
Did he hurt you?

281
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:24,355
No, My Lord.

282
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:27,158
It's Mhaegen.

283
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:29,560
Who?

284
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:33,298
She works for you.

285
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:36,935
She's the one--
the Gold Cloaks,

286
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:39,270
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

287
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:41,973
That was...

288
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:44,209
poorly handled.

289
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,880
Sometimes those
with the most power

290
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:50,616
have the least grace.

291
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,220
I can't stop
thinking about it.

292
00:21:54,254 --> 00:21:56,356
I can't sleep.

293
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:00,860
That poor little baby.

294
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:03,696
You know, you remind me
of another girl,

295
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,765
a lovely thing
I once acquired

296
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,801
from a Lysene
pleasure house--

297
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:11,971
beautiful, like yourself,

298
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:15,541
and intelligent,
like yourself.

299
00:22:15,576 --> 00:22:18,444
But she wasn't happy.

300
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:22,849
She cried often.

301
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,986
I asked her why,
but we didn't have

302
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:29,890
the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

303
00:22:33,195 --> 00:22:35,829
Yes, it was quite sad.

304
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:40,835
Girls from the Lysene
pleasure houses are expensive,

305
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:43,004
extremely expensive.

306
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,675
And this one wasn't
making me any money.

307
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:53,448
I hate bad investments.

308
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:56,517
Really, I-- I do.

309
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,586
They haunt me.

310
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:05,693
I had no idea
how to make her happy,

311
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:08,795
no idea how
to mitigate my losses.

312
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:12,432
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me

313
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,067
a tremendous
amount of money

314
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:19,072
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

315
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,876
To use her
in ways that...

316
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:25,646
Would never occur
to most men.

317
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:30,050
And you know what
occurs to most men.

318
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:38,125
I would not say he succeeded in
making her happy,

319
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,763
but my losses were
definitely mitigated.

320
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:52,706
Take tonight off
to mourn Mhaegen's child.

321
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:56,176
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

322
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,979
And you'll be happy?

323
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,485
That makes me happy.

324
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:17,931
<i>More wine?</i>

325
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:20,967
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, My Lord.

326
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:25,038
Leave us, Podrick. I believe we
know how to pour our own wine.

327
00:24:25,974 --> 00:24:27,608
That's your new squire?

328
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:29,676
I could've found you
a proper lad.

329
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:32,446
Myself, I prefer
the improper ones.

330
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:35,483
Mm, that's a good red.
Dornish?

331
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,984
You know your wines,
My Lord.

332
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:38,519
That I do.

333
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:41,356
A fine dinner, My Lord.

334
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,325
Call me Tyrion, please.

335
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,194
I'm sure you're getting
used to fine dinners,

336
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:46,762
now that you're a lord.

337
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,664
Maybe I'll hire
this cook of yours.

338
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:50,700
Wars have been
started for less.

339
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,872
I heard there was some trouble in
Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

340
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:58,040
Mm, nasty business.

341
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:00,042
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

342
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:02,310
The City Watch
must keep the peace,

343
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:06,213
only I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

344
00:25:06,248 --> 00:25:09,783
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

345
00:25:09,817 --> 00:25:11,885
Especially
the queen's orders.

346
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,687
I never said they were
the queen's orders.

347
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:18,225
No, but who else would want to
murder King Robert's bastards?

348
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,893
She's always been
a jealous woman.

349
00:25:19,927 --> 00:25:21,928
You know your sister
better than I do.

350
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:23,997
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

351
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,666
I don't listen to filth.

352
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,969
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

353
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:31,905
I suppose people who do believe
that filth consider Robert's bastards

354
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,607
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

355
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:36,710
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

356
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,912
I appreciate
your loyalty.

357
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:44,516
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

358
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:48,386
in the throne room,
did you give the order?

359
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,388
I did.

360
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:52,123
And I would again.

361
00:25:52,157 --> 00:25:53,958
The man was a traitor.

362
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:55,961
He tried to buy
my loyalty.

363
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:58,163
The fool.

364
00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:00,332
He had no idea
you were already bought.

365
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:02,568
Are you drunk?

366
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,771
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp!

367
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:08,909
I'm not questioning
Your Honor, Lord Janos.

368
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,612
I'm denying its existence.

369
00:26:10,646 --> 00:26:13,748
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf--

370
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:16,517
Dwarf? Mm, you should
have stopped at Imp.

371
00:26:16,552 --> 00:26:19,220
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

372
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:21,623
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

373
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:24,659
I intend to serve
as Hand of the King

374
00:26:24,693 --> 00:26:26,360
until my father
returns from the war.

375
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:28,495
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

376
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,431
well, I just wouldn't
feel safe with you lurking about.

377
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:32,966
What are you t--

378
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:34,769
my friends at court
will not allow this!

379
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,904
- The queen herself has granted--
- The <i>queen regent.</i>

380
00:26:36,938 --> 00:26:39,807
And you're a fool to believe
she is your friend.

381
00:26:39,842 --> 00:26:42,177
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

382
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:45,280
No, we shan't.

383
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,123
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

384
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:57,792
From there I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

385
00:26:57,827 --> 00:26:59,962
<i>I hope you enjoy the Wall.</i>

386
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:02,864
I found it
surprisingly beautiful...

387
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:06,835
In a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

388
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:08,403
The lads will escort you.

389
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:10,305
The streets aren't safe
at night, My Lord.

390
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,708
These men are
under my command!

391
00:27:12,742 --> 00:27:14,910
I command you to arrest
this cutthroat.

392
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:16,779
His name is Bronn

393
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:19,114
and he is the new
commander of the City Watch.

394
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:20,782
Boys.

395
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:25,320
I have friends at court,

396
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:27,890
powerful friends!

397
00:27:27,924 --> 00:27:30,492
The king himself
made me a lord!

398
00:27:35,432 --> 00:27:37,700
To the new Commander.

399
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:47,777
If I told you to murder
an infant girl, say,

400
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:51,047
still at her
mother's breast,

401
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:54,016
would you do it
without question?

402
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:58,054
Without question? No.

403
00:27:58,088 --> 00:28:00,389
I'd ask, "how much?"

404
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:20,143
If they come back,
I say we yield.

405
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:21,478
Gendry's the one
they want.

406
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,580
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

407
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,214
I ain't afraid
of no battles.

408
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:27,883
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

409
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:29,418
I've seen
lots of battles.

410
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:31,119
- I saw--
- Liar.

411
00:28:31,154 --> 00:28:33,389
I saw a man
kill another man

412
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:35,791
just outside a tavern
in Flea Bottom.

413
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:38,227
Stabbed him
right in the neck.

414
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:41,063
Two men fighting
isn't a battle.

415
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,933
- They had armor on.
- So?

416
00:28:43,968 --> 00:28:46,469
So, if they've got armor on,
it's a battle.

417
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,271
No, it isn't.

418
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,907
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

419
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:53,209
Gendry's an armorer's
apprentice.

420
00:28:53,243 --> 00:28:56,145
Hot pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

421
00:28:57,981 --> 00:29:00,483
It's, um, when
they've got armor on.

422
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:03,319
<i>Who told you that?</i>

423
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:04,787
A knight.

424
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:07,457
How'd you know
he was a knight?

425
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,128
Well, it was 'cause
he got armor on.

426
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:14,196
You don't have to be a knight
to have armor.

427
00:29:14,231 --> 00:29:15,898
Any idiot
can buy armor.

428
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,667
<i>How do you know?</i>

429
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:19,802
'Cause I sold armor.

430
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:34,182
What do the Gold Cloaks
want with you?

431
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:37,052
- No idea.
- <i>You're a liar.</i>

432
00:29:37,086 --> 00:29:39,387
You know, you shouldn't insult
people that are bigger than you.

433
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:42,057
Then I wouldn't get
to insult anyone.

434
00:29:42,091 --> 00:29:44,459
I don't care
what any of them want.

435
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,228
No good's ever come
of their questions.

436
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:48,463
No good's <i>ever</i> come?

437
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:50,499
Who asked questions
before?

438
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:53,835
How can someone so small be such
a huge pain in my ass?

439
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:55,937
Who asked questions?

440
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,507
The Hand of the King.

441
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:01,743
Hands of the King.

442
00:30:01,777 --> 00:30:04,946
Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

443
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,517
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

444
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:11,486
Lord Stark?

445
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,790
See? Asking me
questions is bad luck.

446
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:19,726
You'll probably
be dead soon.

447
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,029
- What did they ask about?
- My mom.

448
00:30:23,063 --> 00:30:25,732
- Who's your mom?
- Just my mom--

449
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:27,801
worked in a tavern,
died when I was little.

450
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,302
And who was your father?

451
00:30:29,337 --> 00:30:32,705
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

452
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,840
What about you anyway?

453
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,976
You thought
they were after you.

454
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:39,811
Why?

455
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:42,380
Did you kill someone or is it
just because you're a girl?

456
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,683
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

457
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,008
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

458
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,233
Stupider.

459
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:50,009
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

460
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,547
Yeah, that's true,
but you're still a girl.

461
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:52,772
I am not!

462
00:30:53,126 --> 00:30:55,327
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

463
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,664
I don't need
to take a piss.

464
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:06,940
Lommy and hot pie
can't know.

465
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:08,408
No one can know.

466
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:12,346
Well, they won't,
not from me.

467
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:17,517
My name's not Arry.

468
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:20,319
It's Arya...
of House Stark.

469
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:25,590
Yoren is taking me home
to Winterfell.

470
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:28,893
He was your father--
the Hand, the traitor.

471
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:30,961
He was never a traitor.

472
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:33,029
Joffrey is a liar.

473
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:35,398
So you're a highborn, then.
You're a lady.

474
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,400
No. I mean, yes.

475
00:31:37,435 --> 00:31:38,869
My mother was a lady
and my sister--

476
00:31:38,903 --> 00:31:40,370
Yeah, but you were
a lord's daughter

477
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:42,472
and you lived
in a castle and you--

478
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:45,209
look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said--

479
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:47,511
and I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

480
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:50,347
I-- I should be
calling you "My Lady."

481
00:31:50,381 --> 00:31:53,350
- Do not call me "My Lady."
- As My Lady commands.

482
00:31:53,385 --> 00:31:55,319
Well, that was unladylike.

483
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:57,622
Oh!

484
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,551
What's she carrying?

485
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:29,287
Myrish oranges,

486
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:32,357
wine from the Arbor...

487
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:35,827
And the heir to Pyke
and the Iron Islands.

488
00:32:38,263 --> 00:32:41,265
The only living son
of Balon Greyjoy.

489
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,503
Me.

490
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:50,106
I don't like wine.

491
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:52,242
Woman's drink.

492
00:32:54,812 --> 00:32:56,614
I need to get to Pyke.

493
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,526
I'll find you a horse.

494
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,408
I'm heading that way.
I can take you there.

495
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:25,111
I bet you can.

496
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:26,979
Have you been
at sea long?

497
00:33:27,014 --> 00:33:29,549
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

498
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:31,985
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

499
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:34,687
Maybe you don't know
what you're like.

500
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,757
Maybe you need
someone to teach you.

501
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,926
Do you know who I am?

502
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:43,197
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

503
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:46,500
Lord Greyjoy?

504
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,938
Have my things sent up
to the castle.

505
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,824
You should give me
the reins.

506
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:11,726
I'm a better rider
than you.

507
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,861
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

508
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:15,363
Nine years?

509
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,865
Do you still know
your way around a ship?

510
00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:19,934
Have these hands
ever touched a rope?

511
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:22,436
Don't you worry
about my hands.

512
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:26,373
The sea is in my blood.

513
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:29,710
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

514
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:32,913
I have a proposal
for my father,

515
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,617
one that will
make him king again,

516
00:34:35,651 --> 00:34:37,719
and me after him.

517
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,424
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

518
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,593
Is that an offer
from my future king?

519
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:47,196
An order from
your future king.

520
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:52,101
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

521
00:34:52,135 --> 00:34:55,270
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

522
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,617
Father.

523
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,820
Nine years, is it?

524
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:15,856
They took
a frightened boy.

525
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,726
<i>What have</i>
<i>they given back?</i>

526
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,163
A man.

527
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:25,601
- Your blood and your heir.
- <i>We shall see.</i>

528
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,673
Stark had you
longer than I did.

529
00:35:29,707 --> 00:35:31,875
<i>Lord Stark is gone.</i>

530
00:35:33,211 --> 00:35:36,680
And how do you feel
about that?

531
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:42,019
What's done is done.

532
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,088
I've brought you
a proposal from Robb Stark.

533
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:47,257
Who gave you
those clothes?

534
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:50,761
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

535
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:53,730
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

536
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:55,432
You will.

537
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:59,003
That bauble
'round your neck--

538
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:02,173
did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?

539
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,976
<i>I asked a question.</i>

540
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,646
<i>Did you pull it from the neck</i>
<i>of a corpse you made</i>

541
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,284
or did you buy it
to match your fine clothes?

542
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:17,388
Iron or gold?

543
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,759
Gold.

544
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,433
I'll not have my son
dressed as a whore.

545
00:36:31,436 --> 00:36:33,904
My fears have come true--

546
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:36,173
the Starks
have made you theirs.

547
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:39,478
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

548
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:42,781
like a trained raven
clutching his message.

549
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,783
The offer he makes
is one I proposed.

550
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,386
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

551
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,988
hunted with him,
fought at his side.

552
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:50,657
He thinks of me
as a brother.

553
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:53,327
No, not here,
not in my hearing.

554
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,862
You will not
name him brother,

555
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:59,833
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

556
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:02,703
Or have you forgotten
your own blood?

557
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:04,705
I forget nothing.

558
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,608
I remember my brothers.

559
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,578
And I remember
when my father was a king.

560
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,664
I see.

561
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:31,300
I destroy Robb Stark's
enemies for him

562
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:34,737
and he will make me
king of the Iron Islands once again.

563
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:38,573
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

564
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:41,209
I'm your son,
your only living heir.

565
00:37:41,243 --> 00:37:43,678
Who else?

566
00:37:45,714 --> 00:37:47,815
I told you to wait outside.

567
00:37:49,151 --> 00:37:51,252
How did you get
past the guards?

568
00:37:51,286 --> 00:37:53,687
Anything with a cock
is easy to fool.

569
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:56,491
My dear.

570
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:01,262
Yara?

571
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:04,165
So good to see you,
brother.

572
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,835
This is a homecoming I'll tell
my grandchildren about.

573
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:11,773
She can't lead an attack!

574
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:15,043
- And why not?
- You're a woman!

575
00:38:15,077 --> 00:38:18,513
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

576
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:21,049
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

577
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:23,952
after your new father
killed him.

578
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:27,689
What's dead may never die.

579
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,725
The only nights she's spent
off these islands

580
00:38:29,759 --> 00:38:31,760
have been spent
on the sea.

581
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,796
<i>She's commanded men.</i>

582
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,865
<i>She's killed men.</i>

583
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,034
She knows who she is.

584
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:44,139
No man gives me
a crown.

585
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:47,376
I pay the iron price.

586
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,344
I will take my crown,

587
00:38:49,379 --> 00:38:52,648
for that is who I am.

588
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:55,117
That is who
we have always been.

589
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:01,825
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

590
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,728
Who said anything
about the Lannisters?

591
00:39:12,338 --> 00:39:13,806
<i>You'll have your gold</i>

592
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,474
<i>when we take the treasury</i>
<i>at King's Landing.</i>

593
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:17,276
All these kings
fighting for the throne,

594
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:20,246
and this Stannis
has the smallest army.

595
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,247
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

596
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:25,584
Because you're
a smart gambler.

597
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:28,587
Stannis has proved
himself in war twice.

598
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:31,890
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

599
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:33,692
Neither has
the false King Joffrey.

600
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:35,694
And yet they both
have larger armies.

601
00:39:35,728 --> 00:39:37,696
Stannis has just
begun the fight.

602
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,332
His Bannermen
will rally to his cause.

603
00:39:41,367 --> 00:39:44,068
There's no man
in the Seven Kingdoms

604
00:39:44,102 --> 00:39:45,670
more honorable
than Stannis Baratheon

605
00:39:45,704 --> 00:39:47,104
or more worthy
of loyalty.

606
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:48,705
What is the world
coming to

607
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,341
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

608
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,777
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

609
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:55,345
You think I'm insulted?

610
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,381
I <i>am</i> a pirate.
I'm an excellent pirate.

611
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:01,051
<i>I don't sail</i>
<i>for promises.</i>

612
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,485
Of course you do.

613
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,188
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise--

614
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:06,689
a promise that
somewhere on the sea,

615
00:40:06,724 --> 00:40:09,125
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

616
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,928
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

617
00:40:11,963 --> 00:40:14,198
You're not a young man,
Salladhor.

618
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:16,033
And correct me
if I'm wrong--

619
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:17,768
most pirates
don't grow old.

620
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:19,904
Only the clever ones.

621
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:22,840
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

622
00:40:22,874 --> 00:40:24,975
stealing from
Pentoshi cheesemongers

623
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,344
and Meereenese
silk merchants?

624
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:28,445
Then go.
They're out there waiting for you.

625
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,181
That's easy.

626
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:32,750
What I'm offering you
is hard.

627
00:40:34,486 --> 00:40:38,322
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

628
00:40:38,356 --> 00:40:41,058
You'll be the richest man
in Lys and the most famous.

629
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:44,962
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

630
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:48,899
"Salladhor Saan"
is a good name for songs.

631
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:52,502
- It is.
- <i>One thing-- I want the queen.</i>

632
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:55,338
- The queen?
- Cersei-- I want her.

633
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,840
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships.

634
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,176
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

635
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,479
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

636
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:05,348
This war
isn't about you.

637
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,684
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

638
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,520
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

639
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:13,689
As if she would
just let you.

640
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:15,390
You don't know
how persuasive I am.

641
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:17,692
I've never tried
to fuck you.

642
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:23,031
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

643
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,432
the one true God--

644
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:26,033
I've been all over
the world, my boy,

645
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:28,736
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true Gods.

646
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,938
They all think
they found the right one.

647
00:41:30,972 --> 00:41:34,275
The one true God
is what's between a woman's legs,

648
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,878
and better yet,
a queen's legs.

649
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:40,482
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

650
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:42,217
Eh, he's young yet.

651
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,255
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

652
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,024
I cannot promise you
the queen.

653
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:53,229
You believe
your king can win?

654
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:55,464
He is the one true king.

655
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:57,299
You Westerosi
are funny people.

656
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,701
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

657
00:42:02,505 --> 00:42:05,073
I'll sail with you,
Davos Seaworth.

658
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:08,710
You're the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

659
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:10,945
Make me rich.

660
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:14,382
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

661
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:27,830
<i>When will the king</i>
<i>have us sail?</i>

662
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:30,199
As soon as his God
wills it.

663
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:32,869
He's my God, too,
and yours,

664
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:35,572
but you are
too blind to see.

665
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:39,709
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

666
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,410
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

667
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:43,645
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

668
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,447
I wish I had
a God, truly.

669
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:48,150
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen
men pray to every God there is--

670
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:50,585
pray for wind, pray for rain,
pray for home.

671
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,388
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

672
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:57,359
- I wasn't praying.
- No, but I was.

673
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:00,495
Every night
that you were at sea,

674
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:03,632
I lit a candle
and I prayed for you.

675
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:06,367
You want me
to have a God?

676
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:09,537
Fine. King Stannis
is my God.

677
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:12,039
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

678
00:43:12,074 --> 00:43:14,642
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

679
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:16,678
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

680
00:43:16,712 --> 00:43:19,981
You think a fire God
commanded all that?

681
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:23,417
It was Stannis,
only Stannis.

682
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:26,320
Stannis is my king,
but he's only a man.

683
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,322
Don't tell him that.

684
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:33,293
Lord Janos Slynt was
commander of the City Watch.

685
00:43:33,327 --> 00:43:34,728
You had no right
to exile him.

686
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:36,463
I have every right.
I am the King's Hand.

687
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:39,032
You're serving as the King's Hand
till father gets here.

688
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,634
I am Queen Regent.

689
00:43:40,669 --> 00:43:42,336
Listen to me,
Queen Regent.

690
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:44,772
You're losing the people.

691
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:46,909
- Do you hear me?
-  The people.

692
00:43:46,943 --> 00:43:48,711
You think I care?

693
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,413
You might
find it difficult

694
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:53,316
to rule over millions
who want you dead.

695
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,217
Half the city will starve
when winter comes.

696
00:43:55,252 --> 00:43:56,786
The other half will plot
to overthrow you.

697
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,822
<i>And your gold-plated thugs</i>
<i>just gave them</i>

698
00:43:59,857 --> 00:44:01,658
their rallying cry--

699
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:04,294
"The Queen
slaughters babies."

700
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,866
You don't even have
the decency to deny it.

701
00:44:19,443 --> 00:44:22,946
It wasn't you who gave
the order, was it?

702
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:24,848
<i>Joffrey didn't</i>
<i>even tell you.</i>

703
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:29,220
Did he tell you?

704
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:30,589
I imagine that
would be even worse.

705
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:33,559
He did what needed
to be done.

706
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:36,629
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

707
00:44:36,663 --> 00:44:39,531
This is what ruling is--
lying on a bed of weeds,

708
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:42,000
ripping them out
by the root, one by one,

709
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:43,601
before they strangle you
in your sleep.

710
00:44:43,636 --> 00:44:46,170
I'm no king, but I think there's more
to ruling than that.

711
00:44:46,204 --> 00:44:48,205
I don't care
what you think!

712
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,807
You've never
taken it seriously.

713
00:44:49,841 --> 00:44:52,175
You haven't,
Jaime hasn't.

714
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,714
It's all fallen on me.

715
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,556
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

716
00:45:10,462 --> 00:45:12,897
You're funny.

717
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,770
You've always
been funny...

718
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:20,739
<i>But none of your jokes</i>
<i>will ever match</i>

719
00:45:20,773 --> 00:45:22,974
the first one, will they?

720
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:26,878
You remember?

721
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:28,614
Back when you ripped
my mother open

722
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:31,349
on your way out of her
and she bled to death?

723
00:45:32,852 --> 00:45:35,520
She was my mother, too.

724
00:45:35,554 --> 00:45:37,622
Mother gone...

725
00:45:39,225 --> 00:45:41,526
For the sake of you.

726
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:47,532
<i>There's no bigger joke</i>
<i>in the world than that.</i>

727
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:11,891
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

728
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:14,059
How did you fare
with your pirate?

729
00:46:14,094 --> 00:46:17,530
Salladhor Saan will join
our fleet-- 30 ships.

730
00:46:17,564 --> 00:46:19,565
His men know
how to fight.

731
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,002
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

732
00:46:23,037 --> 00:46:24,671
It does seem
the wiser choice.

733
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:27,140
There won't be
a choice this time.

734
00:46:28,342 --> 00:46:30,077
Do you trust him?

735
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:31,812
Salladhor Saan
is an old friend.

736
00:46:31,846 --> 00:46:33,814
I've known him 30 years.

737
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:36,116
I've never trusted him,

738
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:40,254
but once he gets the smell of gold,
he never stops.

739
00:46:40,288 --> 00:46:43,524
Well, if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

740
00:46:46,695 --> 00:46:48,296
Leave us.

741
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:56,038
At once, Your Grace.

742
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:06,248
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

743
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:13,555
Come.

744
00:47:20,395 --> 00:47:21,896
What did you say to him?

745
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,366
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

746
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,603
- Why?
- <i>Because it is true.</i>

747
00:47:29,571 --> 00:47:31,405
You're troubled, my king.

748
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,607
Yeah.

749
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,277
These armies are toys
for the Lord of Light.

750
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,280
Tell your lord
to burn them, then.

751
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,748
I tell him nothing.

752
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:43,985
I pray for his commands
and I obey.

753
00:47:45,754 --> 00:47:49,657
My little brother has 100,000
men according to the scouts,

754
00:47:49,692 --> 00:47:52,894
men whose allegiance
rightly belongs to me.

755
00:47:52,928 --> 00:47:54,829
<i>You must have faith.</i>

756
00:47:54,864 --> 00:47:56,898
Faith?

757
00:47:56,933 --> 00:48:00,468
<i>In a real war, the side</i>
<i>with the greater number wins</i>

758
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,437
nine times out of 10.

759
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:04,105
Then we must be
the 10th.

760
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,477
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

761
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,981
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

762
00:48:13,484 --> 00:48:17,153
I have seen the path
to victory in the flames.

763
00:48:18,655 --> 00:48:22,024
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

764
00:48:22,058 --> 00:48:25,394
I've said the words,
damn you.

765
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:30,766
I burnt the idols.

766
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,040
You must give
all of yourself.

767
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,546
I have a wife.

768
00:48:45,782 --> 00:48:47,750
I took a vow.

769
00:48:48,918 --> 00:48:53,288
She's sickly, weak...

770
00:48:54,824 --> 00:48:57,926
Shut away in a tower.

771
00:48:57,961 --> 00:49:00,062
She disgusts you.

772
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:06,101
And she's given
you nothing--

773
00:49:06,169 --> 00:49:10,873
no sons,
only stillborns,

774
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:13,075
only death.

775
00:49:19,048 --> 00:49:23,518
I will give you
a son, my king.

776
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,956
A son?
