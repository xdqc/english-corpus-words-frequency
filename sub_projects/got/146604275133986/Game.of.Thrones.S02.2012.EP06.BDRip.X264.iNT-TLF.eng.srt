1
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,076
I've taken your castle.

2
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,812
- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.

3
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:44,381
Get up.
You have to get dressed.

4
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,784
I've taken Winterfell.

5
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,820
I took it.
I'm occupying it.

6
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:52,956
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

7
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:56,093
- Why?
- To take the castle.

8
00:02:56,127 --> 00:03:00,530
- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

9
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:04,200
I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight
for Robb and my father both.

10
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:08,270
- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.

11
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:10,673
Find the Halfwit.

12
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,643
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

13
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,111
Why?

14
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,113
So you and I can
go down and tell them

15
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:20,016
- how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
- I won't.

16
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,118
Yes, you will.

17
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:25,220
I won't.
I'll never yield.

18
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,323
We'll fight you
and throw you out.

19
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,492
( Sighs )

20
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,731
The castle is mine,

21
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:37,201
but these people
are still yours.

22
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,403
You'll yield
to keep them safe,

23
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:41,907
to keep them alive.

24
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:44,743
That's what a good
lord would do.

25
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:50,381
Think carefully about
what you want to say.

26
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:55,486
Theon.

27
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,487
Did you hate us
the whole time?

28
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,294
- <i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>
- ( Horse whinnies )

29
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,430
I've yielded
Winterfell to Theon.

30
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:09,399
Louder.

31
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,234
Say Prince Theon.

32
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:14,305
I've yielded Winterfell
to Prince Theon.

33
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,040
You all know me.

34
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:18,876
Aye, we know you for
a steaming sack of shit.

35
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,578
Farlen, you be silent.

36
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:23,715
Listen to your
little Lord, Farlen.

37
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,517
He has more sense
than you do.

38
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,419
All of you should do
as he commands.

39
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:31,156
My father has donned the
ancient crown of salt and rock

40
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:34,693
and declared himself
King of the Iron Islands.

41
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:37,929
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

42
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:39,731
You are all his subjects.

43
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:42,501
Bugger that.
I serve the Starks.

44
00:04:42,535 --> 00:04:44,627
If you think you can
hold the North with this--

45
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:45,937
Shut up!

46
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:49,408
Theon: <i>If you serve me as loyally</i>
<i>as you served Ned Stark,</i>

47
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,511
<i>I  will be as good to you</i>
<i>as he ever was.</i>

48
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,646
Betray me, and you will
wish you hadn't.

49
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:56,414
( Crowd murmuring )

50
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,618
Maester Luwin,
send a raven to Pyke

51
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:02,353
informing my father
of my victory here

52
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,956
and one to Deepwood Motte
to my sister.

53
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,293
Inform her that she's
to bring 500 men to Winterfell.

54
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,729
<i>( Crowd murmuring )</i>

55
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,032
You are a Maester
of the Citadel

56
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:18,334
sworn to serve the lord
of Winterfell, are you not?

57
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,769
I am.

58
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,671
I am the Lord
of Winterfell

59
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,639
as Bran just informed you.

60
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,277
Send the ravens.

61
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:31,481
My Lord.

62
00:05:33,184 --> 00:05:36,254
My Lord Greyjoy.

63
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:39,791
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

64
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:41,360
What do you want?

65
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,662
I was brought here
a captive.

66
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:46,065
You were here the day
I was taken.

67
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,069
I'm the one who took you.
What of it?

68
00:05:50,103 --> 00:05:52,805
Let me serve you.

69
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,441
Theon:
<i>Serve me how?</i>

70
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:57,943
I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

71
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:00,979
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

72
00:06:01,014 --> 00:06:03,549
Put a spear
in my hand again.

73
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,651
So you can bury it
in my neck?

74
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,253
Do you take me
for a fool?

75
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,721
Get up.

76
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:11,824
Step aside.

77
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:14,126
Why?

78
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:17,597
It's your dream,
Little Lord.

79
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:21,068
The ocean has come
to swallow this place.

80
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:24,038
I ain't letting it
drown me.

81
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:26,874
- And in a few days' time--
- Rodrik: <i>Greyjoy!</i>

82
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,981
Woman: <i>What have they</i>
<i>done to him?</i>

83
00:06:34,015 --> 00:06:37,084
We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

84
00:06:37,118 --> 00:06:40,053
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

85
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:43,523
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
we meet as foes.

86
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:47,394
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

87
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:50,897
You were raised here
under this roof.

88
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,600
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

89
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:55,836
King Robb thought of you
as a brother.

90
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:58,806
My brothers are dead.

91
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,609
They died fighting
Stark men, men like you.

92
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:05,079
Aye, they died fighting
a war your father started.

93
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:07,348
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

94
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:09,516
Among them,
but not one of them.

95
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,352
I was his hostage
taken from my home.

96
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:14,087
If he were alive
to see this--

97
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:15,956
He's not.
He's dead.

98
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,058
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war.

99
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:20,360
And Winterfell is mine.

100
00:07:20,395 --> 00:07:23,063
I should have put
a sword in your belly

101
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:24,631
instead of
in your hand.

102
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:27,767
You've served this House
faithfully, old man.

103
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:29,870
But keep talking
and I'll--

104
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,705
( grunts )

105
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:34,708
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up--

106
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:36,444
My prince,

107
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,046
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

108
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,981
I'll lock him in a cell
until he rots--

109
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:44,018
No, he has to pay
the iron price.

110
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:47,155
They'll never respect
you while he lives.

111
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:02,172
<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

112
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,678
Ser Rodrik,

113
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,146
I sentence you to death.

114
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:11,648
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

115
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,051
The old man couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

116
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,753
I urge you not to make
a hasty decision.

117
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,757
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

118
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,258
That was his decision,
not mine.

119
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,760
He is worth more
to you alive than dead.

120
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:27,097
The Starks will pay.

121
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,967
Please, Theon,

122
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,935
think what you do.

123
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,479
You'll address me
as Prince Theon

124
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:46,414
or you'll be next.

125
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:48,416
Come.

126
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:50,852
No!

127
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:54,088
- No!
- Bran: <i>Theon!</i>

128
00:08:54,957 --> 00:08:57,025
Please!

129
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:58,927
Ser Rodrik!

130
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:01,797
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

131
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,600
- Bran: <i>I'm begging you!</i>
- Coward.

132
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,472
Stop! Stop right now!

133
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,241
You don't give commands anymore,
Little Lord.

134
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:14,943
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
- Rodrik: <i>Hush now, child.</i>

135
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:18,080
I'm off to see your father.

136
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:23,085
Bran: You said no harm
would come!

137
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,854
<i>You said no harm would come.</i>
<i>Theon, please.</i>

138
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,691
Any last words, old man?

139
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:31,627
Gods help you,
Theon Greyjoy.

140
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:33,762
Now you are truly lost.

141
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,232
Bran:
<i>Theon, please, don't.</i>

142
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:39,368
- Rickon: <i>Do something.</i>
- Bran: <i>I'll do anything. Please!</i>

143
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,037
Rickon:
<i>No, please, stop it!</i>

144
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,638
- ( Grunts )
- ( Screams )

145
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:55,418
- <i>( Bran wailing )</i>
- <i>( Thunder rumbling )</i>

146
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,456

147
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,363
( Wind howling )

148
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,873
Jon:
Ghost, stay with us.

149
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,974
Ghost!

150
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,643
There goes your pet.

151
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,244
Jon:
<i>He's not a pet.</i>

152
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,780
Qhorin: <i>You're right,</i>
<i>he's not.</i>

153
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:25,383
You can't tame
a wild thing.

154
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,184
You can't trust
a wild thing.

155
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:30,254
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

156
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,656
Wild creatures
have their own rules,

157
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:34,858
their own reasons.

158
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,861
And you'll never
know them.

159
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:40,564
Now the wildlings
we're looking for

160
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,000
sleep during the day
and hunt at night.

161
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,005
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

162
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,940
I said you can't.

163
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:53,010
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

164
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,978
and do their killing
when it's dark.

165
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:58,048
- We could do the same.
- No, we couldn't.

166
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,284
This is their country.

167
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:03,354
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

168
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:05,290
I've lost good men
who fell into a crevasse

169
00:11:05,324 --> 00:11:07,459
they didn't see
till they were in it.

170
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:11,063
My father always said
I'm of the North.

171
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:12,864
( Chuckles )

172
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:15,767
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

173
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:19,037
This look like
home to you?

174
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:22,274
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

175
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:25,610
You understand me?

176
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,079
No, you don't.

177
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:30,047
We're at war.

178
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,749
We've always been at war.

179
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:34,318
It's never going to end 'cause
we're not fighting an enemy.

180
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:37,922
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

181
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,958
The Watch has given
you a great gift.

182
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,527
You only have one thing
to give in return--

183
00:11:43,562 --> 00:11:44,995
your life.

184
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:46,363
I'll gladly give my life.

185
00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:48,765
I don't want you
to be glad about it.

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
I want you to curse
and fight

187
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,269
until your heart's
done pumping.

188
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:55,739
And know this, boy--

189
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:59,475
your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

190
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,710
They'll never know
what you've done.

191
00:12:01,744 --> 00:12:03,245
They'll never know
how you died.

192
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,380
They won't even
know your damn name,

193
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:08,316
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

194
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,987
north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.

195
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:15,156
Now, do you understand me?

196
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,925
I do.

197
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,327
You're even dumber
than you look.

198
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,597
It's just words, boy,

199
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,599
to keep us a little
warmer in the night,

200
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,870
make us feel like
we've got a purpose.

201
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,339
( Laughs )
Come on.

202
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:32,708
We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls

203
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,322
and they find us.

204
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:48,560
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

205
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,630
Can you read?

206
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,702
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

207
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:00,405
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

208
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,243
It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

209
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:06,278
My apologies, My Lord.
I must have--

210
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:09,849
Girl, fetch me the "History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses."

211
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:12,652
It's the one on the--
( Chuckles )

212
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:18,625
My cupbearer can read
better than you.

213
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:31,004
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

214
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,441
My Lord, I--

215
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:38,278
To the Starks
of Winterfell!

216
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:42,515
Who have 20,000 men
and my son!

217
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:46,052
I judged you might be
good for something more

218
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,654
than brutalizing peasants.

219
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:51,056
I see I overestimated you.

220
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:55,928
<i>If you ever put my son's</i>
<i>life at risk again, I'll...</i>

221
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:58,463
Leave us.

222
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:07,872
Put the book away, girl.

223
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:10,541
<i>( Door opens )</i>

224
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:13,110
<i>( Door closes )</i>

225
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:18,382
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

226
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,417
<i>( Knocking )</i>

227
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:23,053
<i>( Door opens )</i>

228
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,578
- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.

229
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,560
Give us the room.

230
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:39,071
Clear all this.

231
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:45,011
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

232
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:55,854
- Wine?
- Thank you.

233
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,692
What news
from the capital?

234
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:04,128
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

235
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:06,330
Ah, the late king Renly.

236
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,566
Rather a short reign.

237
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,602
Murdered by a woman,
I hear.

238
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:12,571
So they say.

239
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:17,744
There has been talk
of other forces at work,

240
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,213
dark forces.

241
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:22,650
Here.

242
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,055
( Scoffs )
Men love to blame demons

243
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,825
when their grand plans
unravel.

244
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:33,661
It is my belief
that a moment of chaos

245
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:36,097
affords opportunities
lost soon after.

246
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:39,267
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

247
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:42,436
Yes, a crisis
is an opportunity.

248
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,938
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

249
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,673
After the Lannisters
and the Starks,

250
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:49,142
the Tyrells command
the largest host.

251
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:51,312
Their lands are the most
fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,

252
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:55,282
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

253
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:59,721
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

254
00:15:59,756 --> 00:16:02,925
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

255
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,628
And Margaery--

256
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:07,431
Wants to be queen.

257
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,266
Yes, she does.

258
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:15,339
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

259
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:18,943
- against my grandson.
- They did.

260
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,312
And perhaps that treason
should be punished

261
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,248
<i>one day,</i>

262
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:27,251
after Stannis and Robb Stark
are defeated.

263
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,856
More wine for Lord Baelish.

264
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:41,232
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

265
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,333
I believe that an advantageous
agreement--

266
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:46,436
The Tyrell host has
returned to Highgarden?

267
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:48,638
They have.

268
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,573
Pardon, My Lord.

269
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:52,542
It's only wine.

270
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:56,045
You would ride
there yourself?

271
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,980
Tonight, with your leave.

272
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:00,248
I'll have an answer
by nightfall.

273
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,950
That'll be all, girl.

274
00:17:07,556 --> 00:17:09,091
What else?

275
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,259
On your son
Tyrion's directive,

276
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:13,795
I met with Catelyn Stark.

277
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,330
Why?

278
00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:17,867
Littlefinger: <i>He had an interesting</i>
<i>proposal for her</i>

279
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:21,104
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

280
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:51,967
- ( Groans )
- ( Shouting )

281
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,523
- A girl.
- A wildling.

282
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,959
We could question her.

283
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:17,961
You could.

284
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,596
She won't answer.

285
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,100
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

286
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,337
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

287
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,440
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

288
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:34,211
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

289
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:37,047
I gave you my name.

290
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:40,817
I'm Jon Snow.

291
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,225
You ought to burn
them you killed.

292
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,928
Qhorin: <i>We'd need a big</i>
<i>fire for that.</i>

293
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:55,966
Tell me, Ygritte,

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,035
why do you want us
to build a big fire?

295
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:01,306
Are there some more
friends in the area?

296
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,676
Burn them or maybe you'll
need those swords again.

297
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,246
Our boy here's already
killed one dead man.

298
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,681
He can do it again
if he has to.

299
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,283
What waits
beyond the pass?

300
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,352
- The Free Folk.
- How many?

301
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,254
( Chuckles )

302
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,222
Hundreds and thousands.

303
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,792
More than you've
ever seen, Crow.

304
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,228
Why come to the mountains?

305
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,199
What's in the frostfangs
your king could want?

306
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,143
Do you mean to march
on the Wall?

307
00:19:43,217 --> 00:19:45,386
Do you know
who I am, girl?

308
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,922
Qhorin Halfhand.

309
00:19:47,956 --> 00:19:49,456
Tell me true.

310
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:52,760
If your people captured me,

311
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,762
would they take me prisoner?

312
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,964
They'd take your head
off your shoulders

313
00:19:56,998 --> 00:19:59,100
if they was feeling kind.

314
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:01,736
If not,
they'd kill you slow.

315
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,371
( Sighs )

316
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,774
We have no food for her.

317
00:20:06,808 --> 00:20:09,142
Can't spare a man
to watch her.

and met many women,

479
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:21,288
but none that are
immune to flattery.

480
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:24,024
- <i>The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

481
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,059
Here he comes.

482
00:30:26,094 --> 00:30:29,696
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

483
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:31,365
Terrible dreams.

484
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:34,568
I could not sleep
until the sun was shining

485
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:37,104
and the birds were singing.

486
00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:39,873
<i>Look what a beauty you are</i>

487
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,475
<i>now the Red Waste</i>
<i>has been washed off you.</i>

488
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,845
I am sorry about
all that unpleasantness.

489
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:50,349
The silver hair
of a true Targaryen.

490
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:53,820
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
she is far too lovely

491
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:56,390
for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

492
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:59,960
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

493
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:02,062
who sold pepper
off the back of a wagon,

494
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:05,499
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

495
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,767
Every lady alive
was lovelier

496
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:10,036
and higher born
than my grandfather.

497
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:11,904
- ( Laughs )
- Daenerys: <i>Ahem.</i>

498
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:15,474
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

499
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:17,443
I'll have them flogged
in the square.

500
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:19,411
Thank you, My Lord.
You are a gracious host,

501
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,347
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

502
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,183
Oh, she has a talent
for drama, this one.

503
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:29,321
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

504
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,789
My birthright--

505
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,725
the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros.

506
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:35,428
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

507
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:37,530
I cannot give you
what I do not have.

508
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:40,167
I'm not asking you
for the Kingdoms.

509
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,969
I'm asking you
for ships.

510
00:31:42,003 --> 00:31:43,638
I need to cross
the Narrow Sea.

511
00:31:43,672 --> 00:31:45,540
I need my ships as well.

512
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:47,041
I use them, you see,

513
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:49,544
to bring spices from
one port to another.

514
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:51,078
Whatever you grant me
now will be repaid

515
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:53,882
three times over when
I retake the Iron Throne.

516
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,350
Retake?

517
00:31:55,384 --> 00:31:57,518
Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

518
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:00,388
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

519
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:02,790
But if you did not
sit on it yourself,

520
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:06,261
would it not be correct
to say take the Iron Throne?

521
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:08,329
I didn't come here
to argue grammar.

522
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:11,232
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

523
00:32:11,266 --> 00:32:13,834
So let me explain
my position,

524
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,803
little princess.

525
00:32:15,838 --> 00:32:19,306
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

526
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:21,309
I make my living by trade.

527
00:32:21,343 --> 00:32:24,678
And I judge every trade
on its merits.

528
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:26,346
You ask for ships.

529
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:29,416
You say I shall be
repaid triple.

530
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,252
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

531
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,521
But before you
repay your debts,

532
00:32:34,555 --> 00:32:37,156
you must seize
the Seven Kingdoms.

533
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:39,858
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

534
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,360
You do not have an army.

535
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,495
Do you have powerful
allies in Westeros?

536
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,664
There are many there
that support my claim.

537
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:47,166
When were you
there last?

538
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:49,802
I left when
I was a baby.

539
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:52,739
So, in truth,
you have no allies.

540
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:55,529
The people will rise
to fight for their rightful

541
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:57,244
Queen when I return.

542
00:32:57,245 --> 00:32:59,113
Ah.

543
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:00,915
Forgive me,
little princess,

544
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:04,386
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

545
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,887
Now if you'll pardon me.

546
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:08,623
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

547
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:11,293
Yes, we've met.
A shrewd man.

548
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:14,929
For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

549
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:17,832
<i>He believed--</i>
<i>the world believed--</i>

550
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,800
that the ages
had turned them to stone.

551
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:23,037
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

552
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:26,039
But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs

553
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:28,542
into a great fire,
they would hatch.

554
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:33,114
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

555
00:33:33,148 --> 00:33:35,316
But when the fire
burned out,

556
00:33:35,351 --> 00:33:37,552
I was unhurt,

557
00:33:37,586 --> 00:33:40,422
the Mother of Dragons.

558
00:33:42,992 --> 00:33:45,260
Do you understand?

559
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:50,399
I'm no ordinary woman.

560
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:53,401
My dreams come true.

561
00:33:58,174 --> 00:34:00,441
I admire your passion.

562
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:05,346
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

563
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,047
I'm sorry, little princess.

564
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,416
I am not
your little princess.

565
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,486
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

566
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,522
and I will take
what is mine.

567
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:17,658
With fire and blood,
I will take it.

568
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:21,262
Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.

569
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:41,815
Who taught you to read?

570
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:44,117
My father, My Lord.

571
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:46,120
Hmm.

572
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:48,355
I taught my son
Jaime to read.

573
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,360
The Maester came
to me one day,

574
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:55,562
told me he wasn't learning.

575
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:58,365
He couldn't make sense
of the letters.

576
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,102
He reversed them
in his head.

577
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:03,972
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

578
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,041
and that we simply
must accept it.

579
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:08,143
Ha!

580
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:11,647
After that,
I sat Jaime down

581
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:14,851
for four hours every day
until he learned.

582
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:20,090
He hated me for it,
for a time.

583
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,760
For a long time,

584
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:24,629
but he learned.

585
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:32,503
Where is your father?
Is he alive?

586
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:37,007
Who was he?

587
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:39,643
A stonemason.

588
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:41,977
A stonemason
who could read?

589
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:44,413
- Hmm.
- He taught himself.

590
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:47,182
Quite a man.

591
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:50,519
What killed him?

592
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:54,255
Loyalty.

593
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,960
You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?

594
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:02,631
Did...

595
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:07,770
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

596
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:11,040
No...

597
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:13,977
But you've already begun.

598
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:17,447
Did you know
your father, My Lord?

599
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:19,616
I did.

600
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:22,820
I grew up with him.

601
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:27,692
I watched him
grow old.

602
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:32,965
<i>He loved us.</i>

603
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,801
He was a good man,

604
00:36:35,836 --> 00:36:38,537
but a weak man,

605
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:42,074
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

606
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:46,479
I'm cold.

607
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:49,215
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

608
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,618
Mmm.

609
00:36:54,188 --> 00:36:56,455
( Horse whinnies )

610
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:18,044
( Grunts )

611
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,746
Where are you going, girl?

612
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,716
The armory,
My Lord.

613
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:24,352
Why?

614
00:37:24,386 --> 00:37:26,220
Lord Tywin sent me.

615
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,458
What might this be?

616
00:37:30,492 --> 00:37:33,394
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

617
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:35,496
What for?

618
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,365
To take to the armory.

619
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,901
Why would he do that?

620
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:44,505
Let's go and ask him.

621
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:49,410
Move!

622
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:53,381
Get out of the way!

623
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:09,832
( Men chatting )

624
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:24,979
Amory Lorch.

625
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:27,014
A girl has named
a second name.

626
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:28,616
A man will do
what must be done.

627
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,585
Now!

628
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:34,489
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

629
00:38:34,524 --> 00:38:36,792
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

630
00:38:36,826 --> 00:38:38,761
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

631
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:41,797
- It has to be now.
- ( Sighs )

632
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:51,073
Guard!

633

640
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:48,164
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

641
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:50,332
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

642
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,768
It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.

643
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:55,904
But if I remember
my lessons,

644
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:58,473
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

645
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:01,008
unless she's a queen
or a princess.

646
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:03,243
I could find
someone who knows.

647
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,846
Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?

648
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,914
Because it's obvious.

649
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:11,584
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

650
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,554
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

651
00:40:16,056 --> 00:40:17,423
I'd call you a liar.

652
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,860
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

653
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,999
I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.

654
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:30,402
Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.

655
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:37,075
Quite a pretty spot.

656
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:39,744
Will we be here long?

657
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:42,513
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

658
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:44,982
I'm not a spy.

659
00:40:45,016 --> 00:40:48,084
Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.

660
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:51,922
You're right.
You've found me out.

661
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,690
I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.

662
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:56,160
"The young wolf
is on the move."

663
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:59,898
Perhaps you'd join me...

664
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:04,203
If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

665
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:06,539
Robb.

666
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:09,842
Mother.

667
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:18,484
Mother, this is
Lady Talisa.

668
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,786
She's been helping
with the wounded.

669
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,722
She's been very...
helpful.

670
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:25,290
Lady Talisa.

671
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:26,991
Lady Stark.

672
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,859
Lady Talisa...?

673
00:41:28,894 --> 00:41:32,463
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

674
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:35,433
Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

675
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:38,537
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

676
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:42,742
Excuse me, My Lady.
Your Grace.

677
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:52,987
I've missed you.

678
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:56,424
Yes, you look
positively forlorn.

679
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:59,293
You surprised me,
that's all.

680
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:02,497
I didn't think
I'd see you today.

681
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:04,899
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

682
00:42:04,934 --> 00:42:06,367
I know.

683
00:42:06,402 --> 00:42:09,070
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

684
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:11,906
I'm afraid they come
at a cost.

685
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,343
- I know.
- You are promised to another--

686
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:19,847
a debt that must be paid.

687
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:22,250
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

688
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:26,021
My Lady.
News from Winterfell.

689
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:27,989
( Wind howling )

690
00:42:38,401 --> 00:42:41,203
Your brothers desert you?

691
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:43,471
I can tell you
which way to go.

692
00:42:43,506 --> 00:42:46,141
We'll stop here.

693
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:48,143
Too dark to go
any farther today.

694
00:42:48,177 --> 00:42:51,079
Here? There's no
shelter here.

695
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:52,514
There's no shelter
anywhere.

696
00:42:52,548 --> 00:42:55,284
There is if you know
where to look.

697
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,689
The cold
could kill us both.

698
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:02,724
- If you light a fire--
- No fire.

699
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:05,560
- But a fire is--
- No fire.

700
00:43:08,197 --> 00:43:10,365
Have it your way.

701
00:43:17,273 --> 00:43:19,875
We'll stay warmer
if we stay close.

702
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:24,413
Bet you freeze to death
before I do.

703
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:28,685
Bet your life.

704
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:55,279
Think they're out
looking for you?

705
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:59,450
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

706
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:01,686
Yes.

707
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,424
You're brave.

708
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,293
Stupid,

709
00:44:09,328 --> 00:44:11,229
but brave.

710
00:44:13,866 --> 00:44:17,135
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

711
00:44:33,185 --> 00:44:34,952
Stop moving.

712
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:38,657
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

713
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:40,559
Stop it!

714
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:55,474
- <i>You're still moving.</i>
- Was I?

715
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:58,110
I didn't notice
that time.

716
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:10,922
This cannot be true.

717
00:45:10,956 --> 00:45:12,657
Bolton: <i>We've had ravens</i>
<i>from White Harbor,</i>

718
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:14,893
Barrowton
and the Dreadfort.

719
00:45:14,927 --> 00:45:16,928
I'm afraid it is true.

720
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,731
Why?
Why would Theon--

721
00:45:19,766 --> 00:45:22,001
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

722
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:24,704
- <i>My brothers?</i>
- We've heard nothing of them.

723
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:26,639
( Sighs )

724
00:45:26,674 --> 00:45:28,976
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

725
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,680
I told you,
never trust a Greyjoy!

726
00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:38,819
I must go North at once.

727
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:40,988
There's still a war
to win, Your Grace.

728
00:45:41,022 --> 00:45:43,490
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

729
00:45:43,524 --> 00:45:45,026
How can I ask men
to follow me if I can't--

730
00:45:45,051 --> 00:45:46,760
You are a king.

731
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:49,596
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

732
00:45:49,631 --> 00:45:51,432
Let me go
and talk to Theon.

733
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:54,369
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

734
00:45:54,403 --> 00:45:57,672
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

735
00:45:57,706 --> 00:46:00,041
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

736
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:04,279
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

737
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:07,415
We have the Lannisters
on the run.

738
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:12,087
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

739
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:15,758
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

740
00:46:15,792 --> 00:46:20,396
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

741
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:23,432
And Theon-- I want him
brought to me alive.

742
00:46:24,968 --> 00:46:27,436
I want to look him
in the eye and ask him why.

743
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:30,072
And then I'll take
his head myself.

744
00:46:30,107 --> 00:46:33,976
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

745
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,911
I'm no liar.

746
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,981
All wildlings
are liars and savages

747
00:46:39,015 --> 00:46:40,850
with no loyalty
to anything or anyone.

748
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:43,219
I done what I had
to do to stay alive.

749
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:46,122
I hate the Starks
as well as you do.

750
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:49,459
Let me serve you,
My Lord.

751
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:52,296
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

752
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,798
There are other ways
to serve, My Lord.

753
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:57,367
I'm a prince now,
and you'd do well--

754
00:46:57,402 --> 00:47:00,304
There are other ways
to serve, my prince.

755
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:02,840
( Chuckles )

756
00:47:04,777 --> 00:47:06,412
Like what?

757
00:47:08,948 --> 00:47:11,751
We know things,
the Free people.

758
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:14,353
You know things?

759
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:16,289
Like what?

760
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:18,591
How to eat dirt?
( Laughs )

761
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,627
( Scoffs )
Other things.

762
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:25,397
Savage things.

763
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,234
Wait outside.

764
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,352
I always wondered
what you had under there.

765
00:47:48,386 --> 00:47:51,388
It comes at a price.

766
00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:53,690
I'm not killing you.
That's your price.

767
00:47:53,725 --> 00:47:55,292
I already had that.

768
00:47:56,828 --> 00:47:58,295
What do you want, then,

769
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:00,931
other than
your miserable life?

770
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:03,067
What all free people want--

771
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:05,236
my freedom.

772
00:48:10,108 --> 00:48:11,977
Well, you shall
have it, then.

773
00:48:14,246 --> 00:48:16,848
But only if you
serve me well.

774
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:24,656
- Ow.
- Shh.

775
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,759
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

776
00:48:27,793 --> 00:48:29,327
They thought so, too.

777
00:48:29,361 --> 00:48:31,997
He hated me,
the man who hit me.

778
00:48:32,031 --> 00:48:34,599
I saw it in his eyes.
Hated me.

779
00:48:34,634 --> 00:48:36,434
He never met me before,

780
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:39,437
but he wanted
to hurt me.

781
00:48:39,471 --> 00:48:42,507
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger--

782
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:44,809
you are everything
he will never have.

783
00:48:44,843 --> 00:48:46,978
Your horse eats better
than his children.

784
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:50,348
It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

785
00:48:50,382 --> 00:48:53,251
I would have given them
bread if I had it.

786
00:48:53,286 --> 00:48:55,887
I hate the King
more than any of them.

787
00:48:55,922 --> 00:48:57,756
Don't say these things.

788
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,057
If the wrong
people hear you--

789
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:01,393
But you're not
the wrong people.

790
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:08,967
Don't trust anybody.

791
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:11,569
Life is safer
that way.

792
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:43,136
( Murmurs )

793
00:49:52,413 --> 00:49:55,248
And where
are you going?

794
00:49:56,483 --> 00:49:59,052
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

795
00:49:59,086 --> 00:50:01,921
- What?
- Me.

796
00:50:04,325 --> 00:50:07,127
He says I'm to make
the rounds.

797
00:50:13,268 --> 00:50:15,769
And keep you warm.

798
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:23,310
( Groans )

799
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,848
( Whistles )

800
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:40,427
( Panting )

801
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:46,133
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

802
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,809
The Silk King won't support me

803
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:49,834
because of his business with
the Lannisters.

804
00:50:49,837 --> 00:50:51,805
Why offend
his best customer?

805
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,208
And the Copper King
offers me a single ship

806
00:50:55,242 --> 00:50:58,611
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

807
00:50:58,645 --> 00:51:01,613
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

808
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:05,149
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

809
00:51:05,184 --> 00:51:07,685
Truly nothing.

810
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,787
I slept by the docks.

811
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:12,556
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

812
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:15,626
If not,
I dreamed of food.

813
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,662
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth.

814
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:21,131
Do you think the path
from poverty to wealth

815
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:23,533
is always pure
and honorable?

816
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:27,203
I have done
many things, Khaleesi,

817
00:51:27,237 --> 00:51:29,739
that a righteous man
would condemn.

818
00:51:29,773 --> 00:51:33,343
And here I am,
with no regrets.

819
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:49,828
Bar the gates.
Ring the bells.

820
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:52,530
Slowly, Khaleesi.

821
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:54,699
- <i>( Bells tolling )</i>
- <i>( People shouting )</i>

822
00:52:01,973 --> 00:52:04,240
<i>Where are they?</i>

823
00:52:10,648 --> 00:52:13,350
Where are my dragons?!

824
00:52:18,991 --> 00:52:21,726
<i>( Dragons screeching )</i>

825
00:52:41,347 --> 00:52:44,116
