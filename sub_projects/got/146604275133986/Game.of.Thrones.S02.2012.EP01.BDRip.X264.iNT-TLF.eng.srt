1
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,485
Well struck.

2
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,287
Well struck, Dog.

3
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,026
Did you like that?

4
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,927
It was well struck,
Your Grace.

5
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:27,297
I already said
it was well struck.

6
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,667
Yes, Your Grace.

7
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,244
- Who's next?
<i>- Lothor Brune,</i>

8
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:43,748
freerider in the service
of Lord Baelish.

9
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:47,218
Ser Dontos the Red
of House Hollard.

10
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:52,724
Ser Dontos the Red
of House Hollard!

11
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,293
<i>Here I am.</i>

12
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:57,096
Here I am.

13
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:05,036
Sorry, Your Grace.

14
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,871
My deepest apologies.

15
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:08,672
<i>- Are you drunk?</i>
- No.

16
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:11,409
Uh, no.
No, Your Grace.

17
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:14,211
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

18
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:16,414
That's not much at all.

19
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,916
Please,
have another cup.

20
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:20,318
Are you sure, Your Grace?

21
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:22,654
<i>Yes. To celebrate</i>
<i>my name day.</i>

22
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:25,391
Have two.
Have as much as you like.

23
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,362
I would be honored,
Your Grace.

24
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:32,833
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

25
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:35,168
See that he drinks
his fill.

26
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,756
You can't.

27
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,557
What did you say?

28
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,593
Did you say I can't?

29
00:04:00,628 --> 00:04:03,296
I only meant
it would be bad luck

30
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,064
to kill a man
on your name day.

31
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:07,365
What kind of stupid
peasant's superstition...

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,234
<i>The girl is right.</i>

33
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:11,035
<i>What a man sows</i>
<i>on his name day</i>

34
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,604
he reaps all year.

35
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,776
Take him away.

36
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,045
I'll have him killed
tomorrow, the fool.

37
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:24,583
He is.

38
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:26,285
A fool--
you're so clever to see it.

39
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,722
He'll make a much better fool
than a knight.

40
00:04:29,756 --> 00:04:33,059
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

41
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:37,296
Did you hear My Lady,
Ser Dontos?

42
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,467
From this day,
you'll be my new fool.

43
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,669
Thank you, Your Grace.

44
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:45,939
And you, My Lady,
thank you.

45
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:48,943
<i>Beloved nephew.</i>

46
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,851
We looked for you
on the battlefield.

47
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:03,189
You were nowhere
to be found.

48
00:05:03,223 --> 00:05:05,925
I've been here,
ruling the kingdoms.

49
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,361
What a fine job
you've done.

50
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,029
Look at you.

51
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:14,466
More beautiful
than ever.

52
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,670
And you! You-- you're going to be
bigger than the hound,

53
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:21,172
but much better looking.

54
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,108
This one doesn't like me.

55
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,977
Can't imagine why.

56
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:27,646
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

57
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:29,582
Me, too, dear.

58
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:31,884
Death is so boring,
especially now

59
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,921
with so much excitement
in the world.

60
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:37,191
My Lady, I'm sorry
for your loss.

61
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,261
Her loss?

62
00:05:40,295 --> 00:05:42,196
Her father was
a confessed traitor.

63
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,831
But still her father.

64
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:45,867
Surely having so recently
lost your own beloved father

65
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,802
you can sympathize.

66
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:53,741
My father was a traitor.

67
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,642
My mother and brother
are traitors, too.

68
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:58,879
I am loyal
to my beloved Joffrey.

69
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:02,482
Of course you are.

70
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:07,987
Well, enjoy your name day,
Your Grace.

71
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,922
Wish I could stay
and celebrate,

72
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:12,725
but there is work
to be done.

73
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,760
What work?

74
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,929
Why are you here?

75
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:23,034
The raven arrived
from the Citadel

76
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:26,204
- this morning, Your Grace.

77
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:29,107
The conclave has met,
considered reports

78
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:31,276
from Maesters all over
the Seven Kingdoms,

79
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,746
<i>and declared</i>
<i>this great summer</i>

80
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,582
done at last.

81
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:40,419
The longest summer
in living memory.

82
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,421
The peasants say,
a long summer means

83
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:45,358
- <i>an even longer winter.</i>
<i>- A common superstition.</i>

84
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:48,428
<i>We have enough wheat</i>
<i>for a five-year winter.</i>

85
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:50,730
If it lasts any longer,

86
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:53,398
we'll have
fewer peasants.

87
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:56,401
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

88
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:57,902
We have nowhere
to house them.

89
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:00,071
And with winter coming,
it'll only get worse.

90
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:03,040
You command the City Watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

91
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:06,410
<i>I do, Your Grace.</i>

92
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:08,446
And are you not
a Lord at my command?

93
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,983
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

94
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:14,653
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

95
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,622
They belong in the field,
not our capital.

96
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:21,059
Yes, Your Grace.

97
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,398
Don't get up.

98
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:32,336
More ravishing than ever,
big sister.

99
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:36,140
War agrees with you.

100
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:39,076
Forgive the interruption.
Carry on.

101
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,712
What are you doing here?

102
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:45,448
Ah, it's been
a remarkable journey.

103
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:49,152
I pissed off the edge
of the Wall,

104
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:52,088
<i>I slept in a sky cell,</i>

105
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:54,357
I fought with
the hill tribes--

106
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,127
so many adventures,

107
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:59,864
so much to be
thankful for.

108
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:03,168
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

109
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,530
Yes. well I, do believe,
the Hand of the King,

110
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,474
is welcome at all
small council meetings.

111
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:10,510
Our father
is Hand of the King.

112
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:13,580
Yes, but in his absence...

113
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:22,989
<i>Your father has named</i>
<i>Lord Tyrion</i>

114
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:25,759
to serve as Hand
in his stead while he fights.

115
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:28,461
Out! All of you out!

116
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:35,836
I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

117
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,838
If I were capable
of tricking father,

118
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:39,473
I'd be emperor
of the world by now.

119
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:42,109
You brought this
on yourself.

120
00:08:42,143 --> 00:08:43,610
I've done nothing.

121
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:45,512
Quite right--
you did nothing

122
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:47,914
when your son called
for Ned Stark's head.

123
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:49,916
Now the entire North
has risen up against us.

124
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:52,419
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

125
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:55,589
That bit of theater will haunt
our family for a generation.

126
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:59,626
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

127
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,862
Do you understand
we're losing the war?

128
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:05,132
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

129
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,934
But I know people.

130
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:09,036
And I know that our enemies hate
each other

131
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,972
almost as much
as they hate us.

132
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:18,913
- Joffrey is King.
- Joffrey is King.

133
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:21,482
You are here
to advise him.

134
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,184
I'm only here
to advise him.

135
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:25,753
And if the King listens
to what I say,

136
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:29,423
the King might just get
his Uncle Jaime back.

137
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:32,626
How?

138
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,228
You love your children.

139
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:35,762
It's your one
redeeming quality.

140
00:09:35,796 --> 00:09:38,731
That and your cheekbones.

141
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:41,600
The Starks love
their children as well.

142
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:44,236
- And we have two of them.
- One.

143
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,807
- One?
- Arya, little animal-- she disappeared.

144
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:51,877
Disappeared?
What, in a puff of smoke?

145
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:56,949
We had three Starks
to trade.

146
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:59,719
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

147
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:02,721
Father will be furious.

148
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,391
It must be odd for you...

149
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,196
to be the disappointing child.

150
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:21,542
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>
<i>watch over your brother</i>

151
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:24,245
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

152
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,249
<i>The walls of my Holdfast</i>
<i>will not stand the winter.</i>

153
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:32,153
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

154
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:34,555
and I'm afraid
the masons today

155
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,325
are not fit to carry
their fathers' hammers.

156
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:40,760
When I was a boy,
I remember seeing them

157
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:45,364
<i>put up a new tower</i>
<i>at Torrhen's Square in a summer.</i>

158
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,500
<i>Men worked back then.</i>

159
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:50,436
Today, my Holdfast
looks like it was built

160
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,705
by drunk children.

161
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,877
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

162
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:58,879
<i>And the Gods</i>
<i>forbid it rains.</i>

163
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:02,149
Why, I might as well sleep
beneath a waterfall.

164
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,818
<i>Maintenance of a Holdfast</i>

165
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:07,255
generally falls
to the lord of that Holdfast.

166
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,757
Generally, yes,

167
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,458
but I've sent
all the young men off

168
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:12,394
to fight
Robb Stark's war.

169
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:15,530
King Robb.
And it's not his war.

170
00:11:15,564 --> 00:11:17,465
He didn't choose it.

171
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:18,933
Maybe not, My Lord,

172
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,068
but he called in his Banners
and took the men.

173
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:22,836
<i>Joffrey killed my father,</i>

174
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,305
your liege lord.

175
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,807
Do you remember
your vows, Ser?

176
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:29,709
Of course I remember!

177
00:11:29,743 --> 00:11:32,812
We can spare four masons
for a week, My Lord.

178
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:35,882
Will that be sufficient
to repair your walls?

179
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:38,218
I-- I believe it will.

180
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,528
We didn't want him here
all day, did we?

181
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:50,832
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

182
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,667
Nor did I.

183
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:57,805
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

184
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,910
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

185
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,081
<i>Lord Portan.</i>

186
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:10,150
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>
<i>watch over your brother</i>

187
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,918
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

188
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,308
Boil this for an hour
and drink the tea.

189
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:07,845
Makes all your pain
go away.

190
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,514
Don't have any pain.

191
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:12,148
Lucky for you.

192
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,051
That way.

193
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,023
You've been having
those dreams again.

194
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,891
<i>I don't dream.</i>

195
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,459
Everyone dreams.

196
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:26,428
I don't.

197
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:28,530
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

198
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:30,699
<i>They say it's an omen.</i>

199
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,403
They say it means Robb will win
a great victory in the South.

200
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,038
Did they?

201
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:41,377
I heard some other fools
say it's Lannister Red.

202
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:44,781
Means the Lannisters will rule
all Seven Kingdoms before long.

203
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:48,218
Heard a stableboy say
it's the color of blood

204
00:13:48,252 --> 00:13:50,621
to mark the death
of your father.

205
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,694
The stars
don't fall for men.

206
00:13:57,728 --> 00:14:00,296
The red comet means
one thing, boy--

207
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:03,032
dragons.

208
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:07,602
The dragons are all dead.

209
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:10,105
They've been dead
for centuries.

210
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:48,411
Mmm.

211
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:51,380
Mmm. Mmm.

212
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:56,118
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

213
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:57,820
He said they ate meat.

214
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,557
He didn't tell you
what kind of meat?

215
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:04,493
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

216
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:07,662
He didn't know anything
about anything.

217
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:15,137
Eh.

218
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,534
She was Drogo's
first gift to me.

219
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,570
I remember.

220
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,075
I promised
to protect them.

221
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:53,443
Promised them their enemies
would die screaming.

222
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,979
How do I make
starvation scream?

223
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:59,016
A trick I never learned,
I'm afraid.

224
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:02,919
Does it ever end?

225
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:04,921
This is farther east
than I've ever been.

226
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:06,489
But, yes, Khaleesi,

227
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:07,991
everything ends,
even the red waste.

228
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:10,593
And you're sure
there's no other way?

229
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:13,363
If we go south to the land
of the Lazarheen,

230
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:15,865
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

231
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,800
If we go west
to the Dothraki Sea,

232
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:19,869
the first
Khalasar we meet

233
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,437
will kill us
and take your dragons.

234
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:24,140
No one will take
my dragons.

235
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:28,011
They are too weak to fight,

236
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:30,046
as are your people.

237
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,416
You must be
their strength.

238
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,486
As you are mine.

239
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:25,402
Rakharo...

240
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:34,679
You never have.

241
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,353
This is bad time to start.

242
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,413
Having a rough time of it?

243
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,014
Nothing's killed me yet.

244
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,617
- Your ass killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

245
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:48,887
I just wanted you to shut up about
your damn blisters.

246
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:05,703
I was born in a place
like this.

247
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:08,873
Later, I fell
on hard times.

248
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:12,276
<i>Are those girls?</i>

249
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,111
<i>Craster's daughters.</i>

250
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:17,882
I haven't seen a girl
in six months.

251
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,851
I'd keep on not seeing them
if I were you.

252
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:23,287
What, he don't like people messing
with his daughters?

253
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:26,124
He don't like people
messing with his wives.

254
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,727
He marries
his daughters,

255
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:32,097
<i>and they give him</i>
<i>more daughters.</i>

256
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,332
And on and on it goes.

257
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,801
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

258
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:40,739
All the other wildlings for a
hundred leagues have disappeared.

259
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:42,740
Craster's still here.

260
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:45,410
He must be doing
something right.

261
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,747
What happens
to the boys?

262
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:51,816
- Hmm?
- <i>He marries his daughters.</i>

263
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:54,753
What does he do
with his sons?

264
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,791
He said he planned
to stop here

265
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:01,393
on his way
to the Frostfangs.

266
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:03,028
People make
all sorts of plans.

267
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:06,498
I haven't seen Benjen Stark
in three years.

268
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:07,999
Haven't missed him.

269
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,769
Always treated me
like scum.

270
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:14,673
Haven't had any good wine
for a long time.

271
00:20:14,707 --> 00:20:17,709
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

272
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:19,778
We're not Southerners.

273
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,547
Who's this little girl?

274
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,818
You're prettier
than half my daughters.

275
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:29,188
You got a nice wet twat
between your legs?

276
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:30,956
What's your name?

277
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:32,991
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

278
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:35,860
Listen to me, bastard.

279
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:39,864
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

280
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:43,768
But now you're in the North,
the real North.

281
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:45,402
The lad meant no harm.

282
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:50,140
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters--

283
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:54,312
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

284
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:57,683
Now, sit down
and shut your mouth.

285
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:02,689
You bring any of that
good wine with you?

286
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:04,558
We did.

287
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:07,094
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

288
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:08,962
All six were abandoned.

289
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:12,065
Where have all
the wildlings gone?

290
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,635
I could tell you,
but I'm thirsty.

291
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:17,771
<i>There's a barrel of</i>
<i>Dornish wine on the sledge.</i>

292
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:20,540
- <i>Bring it in here.</i>
<i>- Yes, commander.</i>

293
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:23,743
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>where they've all gone?</i>

294
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:28,080
<i>North... to join up</i>
<i>with Mance Rayder...</i>

295
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:30,982
Your old friend.

296
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:33,652
He's no friend of mine.

297
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:36,819
He broke his vows,
betrayed his brothers.

298
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:38,044
Oh, aye.

299
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:41,228
But once he was
just a poor black crow.

300
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:44,198
And now he's
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

301
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,701
He's been calling
himself that for years.

302
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:50,472
What's he king of?
A frozen lake somewhere?

303
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:53,909
That's a good-looking axe.

304
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:56,078
<i>Fresh forged?</i>

305
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:00,616
Give it here.

306
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,818
You'll have another one
made at Castle Black.

307
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,754
Here.

308
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:08,591
Oh, that's some
lovely steel.

309
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:15,431
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

310
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,266
Gathering an army.

311
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,535
<i>What I hear,</i>
<i>he's already got more men</i>

312
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:21,871
<i>than any of your</i>
<i>southern kings.</i>

313
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:24,407
And where does he plan
marching this army?

314
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:25,908
When you're
all the way north,

315
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:27,677
there's only
one direction to go.

316
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,517
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

317
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:37,854
The cold winds
are rising.

318
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,391
Let them come.
My roots are sunk deep.

319
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,894
Wife...

320
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:48,965
tell the Lord Crow
how content we are.

321
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,367
This is our place.

322
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,302
Our husband keeps us safe.

323
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:56,506
Better to live free
than die a slave.

324
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:01,778
<i>Don't it make you</i>
<i>jealous, old man,</i>

325
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,880
to see me with
all these young wives

326
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:07,183
and you with no one
to warm your bed?

327
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:09,152
We chose different paths.

328
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:13,623
Oh, aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

329
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:18,627
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

330
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:20,729
and eat me out of pigs.

331
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:22,665
A roof would be welcome.

332
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,233
It's been hard riding.

333
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:27,469
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

334
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:32,808
Any man lays a hand
on one of my wives,

335
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:35,811
he loses the hand.

336
00:23:37,647 --> 00:23:41,449
And I see this one
staring too long,

337
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:44,719
I might just gouge
his eyes out.

338
00:23:44,753 --> 00:23:48,023
Your roof, your rules.

339
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:03,306
Who am I?!

340
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,777
- Who am I?!
- Lord commander.

341
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:09,980
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

342
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:12,616
Who <i>are</i> you?

343
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,918
Your steward.

344
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:17,053
You want to lead
one day?

345
00:24:19,823 --> 00:24:22,558
Then learn
how to follow.

346
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:44,814
<i>Lord of Light, come to us</i>
<i>in our darkness.</i>

347
00:24:44,848 --> 00:24:48,552
We offer you
these false Gods.

348
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:51,521
Take them and cast
your light upon us...

349
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:57,260
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

350
00:24:57,294 --> 00:25:00,796
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

351
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:04,699
<i>After the long summer,</i>

352
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:07,769
<i>darkness will fall heavy</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

353
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:10,505
The stars will bleed.

354
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:12,908
We need to stop her.

355
00:25:12,942 --> 00:25:16,745
<i>The cold breath of winter</i>
<i>will freeze the seas...</i>

356
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:18,177
Not now.

357
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:19,402
<i>...And the dead shall rise</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

358
00:25:22,952 --> 00:25:26,522
All you men were named
in the Light of the Seven!

359
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:29,692
<i>Is this how you treat</i>
<i>the Gods of your fathers?</i>

360
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:34,430
Are you so eager to spit
on your ancestors?

361
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:45,439
You smell of fear--

362
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:49,743
fear and piss
and old bones.

363
00:25:50,978 --> 00:25:52,679
Do you want to stop me?

364
00:25:57,118 --> 00:25:58,985
Stop me.

365
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,534
In the ancient books,
it's written

366
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:17,605
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

367
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:21,809
And that sword shall be
Lightbringer.

368
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:30,118
Stannis Baratheon,

369
00:26:30,152 --> 00:26:32,720
warrior of light,

370
00:26:32,755 --> 00:26:34,656
your sword awaits you.

371
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:08,391
Lord, cast your
light upon us!

372
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:13,262
<i>For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

373
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:19,568
For the night is dark
and full of terror.

374
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,265
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

375
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,933
Stannis is our king.

376
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:53,301
We follow
where he leads,

377
00:27:53,336 --> 00:27:56,037
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

378
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:58,172
Since that boar
killed his brother,

379
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,241
every lord wants
a coronation.

380
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:02,376
I don't serve the others.
I serve Stannis.

381
00:28:02,411 --> 00:28:06,113
As do I,
but loyal service

382
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:09,083
means telling
hard truths.

383
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:13,186
He's surrounded
by fools and fanatics,

384
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:15,989
but he trusts you, Davos.

385
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:19,126
If you tell him
the truth...

386
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,464
What's the truth?

387
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:36,912
<i>"And I declare upon</i>
<i>the honor of my house</i>

388
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:38,380
<i>that my beloved</i>
<i>brother Robert--"</i>

389
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:41,016
he wasn't
my beloved brother.

390
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,251
I didn't love him.
He didn't love me.

391
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,120
A harmless courtesy,
Your Grace.

392
00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:46,521
A lie.
Take it out.

393
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,359
"...that my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

394
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:53,795
the boy Joffrey,
the boy Tommen,

395
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:55,997
and the girl Myrcella
being born of incest

396
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:59,035
<i>between Cersei Lannister and</i>
<i>her brother Jaime Lannister.</i>

397
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:01,971
- <i>By right of birth--"</i>
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

398
00:29:02,005 --> 00:29:04,807
Call him what he is.

399
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:06,342
<i>"...And her brother</i>
<i>Jaime Lannister,</i>

400
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,744
<i>the Kingslayer.</i>

401
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,015
<i>By right of birth and blood,</i>
<i>i do this day lay claim--"</i>

402
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,184
<i>Make it</i> Ser <i>Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the Kingslayer.</i>

403
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,420
Whatever else he is,
the man's still a knight.

404
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,489
"Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

405
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,858
By right of birth
and blood,

406
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,329
<i>I do this day lay claim</i>
<i>to the Iron Throne of Westeros.</i>

407
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,864
Let all true men
declare their loyalty."

408
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:29,233
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

409
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,669
I'll not make
the same mistake.

410
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,738
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the Realm,

411
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,639
from the Arbor
to the Wall.

412
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,576
The time has come
to choose.

413
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,078
Let no man claim ignorance
as an excuse.

414
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,714
Your Grace,the Lannisters
are the true enemy.

415
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,783
If, for the time being, you could
make peace with your brother--

416
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,085
I'll not make peace with Renly
while he calls himself King.

417
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,954
Well, many have already
declared for him--

418
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,123
Mace Tyrell,
Randyll Tarly.

419
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:55,393
Stannis does not need to beg
this lord or that lord for support.

420
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,995
<i>The Lord of Light</i>
<i>stands behind him.</i>

421
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:00,498
And how many ships has
the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

422
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:03,101
- He has no need for ships.
- I'm sure he doesn't,

423
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,536
but we do if we're
going to war.

424
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,639
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

425
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,975
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

426
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,310
I've always served thieves
according to their desserts,

427
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,479
<i>as you well know,</i>
<i>Ser Davos.</i>

428
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:16,514
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark,
they're all thieves.

429
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,017
They'll bend the knee
or I'll destroy them.

430
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:23,621
I owe you
an apology, my King.

431
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,724
My duty is to serve.

432
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:29,827
<i>You have chosen the new God</i>
<i>over the Old Gods.</i>

433
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:33,364
<i>May the Lord of Light</i>
<i>watch over us all.</i>

434
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,766
Shall we drink together?

435
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,802
Don't.

436
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:42,641
A cup of wine to honor
the one true God.

437
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:31,960
The night is dark and full
of terrors, old man,

438
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:35,230
but the fire
burns them all away.

439
00:31:56,786 --> 00:31:58,787
Your Grace.

440
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,836
King in the North.

441
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:16,573
I keep expecting you
to leave me

442
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:18,642
in one castle or another
for safekeeping,

443
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:22,713
but you drag me along
from camp to camp.

444
00:32:22,747 --> 00:32:25,382
Have you grown
fond of me, Stark?

445
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,217
Is that it?

446
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:29,253
I've never seen you
with a girl.

447
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:32,790
If I left you with
one of my bannermen,

448
00:32:32,824 --> 00:32:35,860
your father would know
within a fortnight

449
00:32:35,894 --> 00:32:39,364
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message:

450
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:42,967
"Release my son and you'll be rich
beyond your dreams.

451
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,538
Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

452
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:48,873
You don't trust
the loyalty

453
00:32:48,908 --> 00:32:51,209
of the men following
you into battle?

454
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:54,747
Oh, I trust them
with my life,

455
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:56,782
just not with yours.

456
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:58,650
Smart boy.

457
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,319
What's wrong?

458
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,320
<i>Don't like</i>
<i>being called "boy"?</i>

459
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:05,290
Insulted?

460
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:15,132
<i>You insult yourself,</i>
<i>Kingslayer.</i>

461
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:20,203
<i>You've been defeated by a boy.</i>

462
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:22,705
<i>You're held captive</i>
<i>by a boy.</i>

463
00:33:24,808 --> 00:33:27,410
<i>Perhaps you'll be</i>
<i>killed by a boy.</i>

464
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:35,919
Stannis Baratheon
sent ravens

465
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:39,323
to all the high lords
of Westeros.

466
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:43,028
King Joffrey Baratheon
is neither a true king

467
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,697
<i>nor a true Baratheon.</i>

468
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,866
He's your bastard son.

469
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,470
<i>If that's true,</i>
<i>Stannis is the rightful king.</i>

470
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,538
How convenient for him.

471
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,842
My father learned
the truth.

472
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:58,544
That's why
you had him executed.

473
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,947
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

474
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:03,083
Your son killed him

475
00:34:03,117 --> 00:34:04,551
so the world wouldn't
learn who fathered him.

476
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:08,622
And you-- you pushed
my brother from a window

477
00:34:08,656 --> 00:34:10,624
because he saw you
with the queen.

478
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:18,833
You have proof?

479
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:21,369
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

480
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:23,572
I'm sending one of your cousins
down to King's Landing

481
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,241
with my peace terms.

482
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:28,311
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

483
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,747
You don't know him
very well.

484
00:34:30,781 --> 00:34:35,151
No, but he's starting
to know me.

485
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:38,820
<i>Three victories</i>
<i>don't make you a conqueror.</i>

486
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,924
It's better than
three defeats.

487
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:13,957
<i>This city stinks...</i>

488
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,928
Like dead bodies.

489
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:20,096
<i>A bit corpsey, yes.</i>

490
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,598
And shit.

491
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:24,533
I thought you wanted
to come here.

492
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,238
I love it.

493
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:33,942
You love the smell
of dead bodies and shit?

494
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:37,012
And cum and garlic
and rum.

495
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:40,182
You can smell cum
from the balcony?

496
00:35:40,216 --> 00:35:43,553
I love the stink.
I love the noise.

497
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:45,689
Cities make me
want to fuck.

498
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:49,026
And so did the country.

499
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,630
This is where I belong.

500
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:56,533
Yes, well, you need
to be careful.

501
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,134
No one can know
you're here.

502
00:35:58,169 --> 00:35:59,836
No one will know.

503
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,437
You can't trust anyone
in King's Landing.

504
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,640
<i>They're all liars--</i>
<i>good liars, bad liars,</i>

505
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:07,109
one or two great liars.

506
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:09,144
What about you?

507
00:36:09,178 --> 00:36:11,813
Me? I'm not from here.
I'm a slave to the truth.

508
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:14,649
Truth?

509
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:19,621
You are the biggest
little liar I have ever met.

510
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:21,656
Why do you think
I am so little?

511
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,226
I'm being crushed beneath the
weight of all that truth.

512
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:30,363
Oh!

513
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:33,200
Ned Stark actually
slept on this.

514
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:37,071
As if the poor man
didn't suffer enough.

515
00:36:38,874 --> 00:36:42,344
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

516
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:56,824
- Lord Baelish.
- Your Grace.

517
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:59,427
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

518
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:00,962
Of course,
Your Grace.

519
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:02,930
Ned Stark's youngest
daughter Arya--

520
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:05,166
we can't seem
to locate her.

521
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,701
If she's escaped
the capital,

522
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:09,803
Winterfell seems
the logical destination.

523
00:37:09,837 --> 00:37:12,373
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

524
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:14,341
Curious.

525
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:16,510
If we choose to negotiate
with the Starks,

526
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:18,813
the girl has some value.
Whoever finds her--

527
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:21,382
well, you know what they say about
Lannisters and debts.

528
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,418
Well, you could ask
Varys where she is.

529
00:37:23,453 --> 00:37:25,754
He'll have
an answer for you.

530
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:27,356
Whether you believe it...

531
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,261
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

532
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:33,930
Who knows what they want?

533
00:37:33,964 --> 00:37:37,066
A mockingbird.

534
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,860
You created your
own Sigil, didn't you?

535
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:40,085
Yes.

536
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,939
Appropriate...
for a self-made man

537
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:44,707
with so many
songs to sing.

538
00:37:44,741 --> 00:37:46,375
I'm glad you like it.

539
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,278
Some people are
fortunate enough

540
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:49,945
to be born into
the right family.

541
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,648
Others have to find
their own way.

542
00:37:54,017 --> 00:37:56,051
I heard a song once

543
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:58,720
about a boy
of modest means

544
00:37:58,754 --> 00:38:02,490
who found his way into the
home of a very prominent family.

545
00:38:02,524 --> 00:38:04,292
He loved
the eldest daughter.

546
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:07,729
Sadly, she had eyes
for another.

547
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:10,131
When boys and girls
live in the same home,

548
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,800
awkward situations
can arise.

549
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:15,469
Sometimes, I've heard,
even brothers and sisters

550
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:18,004
develop
certain affections.

551
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,473
And when these affections
become common knowledge,

552
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:24,376
well, that is an awkward
situation indeed,

553
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:26,712
especially
in a prominent family.

554
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:30,182
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

555
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:32,451
I've found.

556
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:34,620
And which truth is that?

557
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:38,291
Knowledge is power.

558
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:42,863
Seize him.

559
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:46,701
Cut his throat.

560
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:50,305
Stop. Wait.

561
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,708
I've changed my mind.
Let him go.

562
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:57,345
Step back three paces.

563
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:01,149
Turn around.

564
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:02,850
Close your eyes.

565
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,491
Power is power.

566
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:12,713
Do see if you can
take some time away from

567
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:14,652
your coins and your whores

568
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:16,798
to locate
the Stark girl for me.

569
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:20,368
I would very much
appreciate it.

570
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:32,380
<i>You're Ser Alton Lannister?</i>

571
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,983
I am, Your Grace.

572
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:38,554
<i>I offer your cousins peace</i>
<i>if they meet my terms.</i>

573
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:42,891
First, your family
must release my sisters.

574
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:46,594
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

575
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:48,562
so he may rest beside
his brother and sister

576
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:51,332
in the crypts
beneath Winterfell.

577
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:53,535
And the remains of all those
who died in his service

578
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:55,770
must also be returned.

579
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:58,307
Their families can honor
them with proper funerals.

580
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:01,410
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- <i>Third...</i>

581
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,549
Joffrey and the Queen Regent
must renounce all claim

582
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:08,185
to dominion of the North.

583
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,421
From this time
till the end of time,

584
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:12,990
we are a free
and independent kingdom.

585
00:40:13,025 --> 00:40:14,992
The King in the North.

586
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:17,494
King in the North.

587
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:19,096
Neither Joffrey
nor any of his men

588
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:21,365
shall set foot
in our lands again.

589
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:23,300
If he disregards
this command,

590
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:26,871
he shall suffer
the same fate as my father,

591
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:31,208
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

592
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:34,745
These are-- Your Grace,
these are--

593
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:37,314
these are my terms.

594
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:40,484
If the Queen Regent and her son
meet them, I'll give them peace.

595
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:43,487
If not...

596
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:45,956
I will litter the south
with Lannister dead.

597
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:48,893
King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
Your Grace.

598
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:50,728
Oh, is he?

599
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:55,266
You'll ride at daybreak,
Ser Alton.

600
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:57,935
That will be all
for tonight.

601
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:14,819
A word, Your Grace?

602
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:19,323
You don't have to call me
"Your Grace" when no one's around.

603
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:22,060
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

604
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:23,928
I'm glad someone's
gotten used to it.

605
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:27,298
The Lannisters are going to reject
your terms, you know?

606
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:29,033
Of course they are.

607
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:31,402
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

608
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:35,139
but we won't beat them until you
take King's Landing.

609
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:39,811
And we can't take
King's Landing without ships.

610
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:42,480
My father has ships and men
who know how to sail them.

611
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:44,282
Men who fought
my father.

612
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:46,751
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

613
00:41:46,785 --> 00:41:50,589
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

614
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:54,827
I'm his only living son.

615
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:57,997
He'll listen to me.
I know he will.

616
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,702
I'm not a Stark.
I know that.

617
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:06,706
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

618
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:10,977
We can avenge him
together.

619
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,248
You don't want
Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

620
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,550
I need his ships.
They say he has 200.

621
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:21,154
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

622
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,123
Shall we rally them
to fight for us?

623
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:24,991
I understand you don't
trust Lord Greyjoy.

624
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:29,696
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
he is not trustworthy.

625
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,365
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

626
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,270
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

627
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,572
Before me, it was father.

628
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:40,273
You married one rebel
and mothered another.

629
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,310
I mothered more than
just rebels,

630
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:45,678
a fact you seem
to have forgotten.

631
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:47,714
If I trade the Kingslayer
for two girls,

632
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:50,015
my bannermen will string me up
by my feet.

633
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,219
You want to leave Sansa
in the Queen's hands?

634
00:42:53,253 --> 00:42:55,321
<i>And Arya--</i>

635
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:58,357
I haven't heard
a word about Arya.

636
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:00,126
What are we fighting for
if not for them?

637
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,761
It's more complicated
than that!

638
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:03,930
You know it is.

639
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,983
It's time for me
to go home.

640
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,919
I haven't seen Bran
or Rickon in months.

641
00:43:25,888 --> 00:43:28,590
You can't go
to Winterfell.

642
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:30,592
I beg your pardon?

643
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:33,761
I'll send Rodrik
to watch over the boys

644
00:43:33,796 --> 00:43:38,332
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

645
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,367
Why in the name
of all the Gods--

646
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:44,304
because I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

647
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:46,473
He's rallied
an army of 100,000.

648
00:43:46,508 --> 00:43:48,242
You know him.
You know his family.

649
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:50,710
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

650
00:43:50,745 --> 00:43:52,279
<i>You have a hundred</i>
<i>other lords--</i>

651
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:56,183
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

652
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:59,019
If Renly sides with us,

653
00:43:59,054 --> 00:44:01,488
we'll outnumber them
two to one.

654
00:44:01,522 --> 00:44:04,458
When they feel the jaws beginning
to shut, they'll sue for peace.

655
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:07,227
We'll get the girls back.

656
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:10,764
Then we'll all
go home... for good.

657
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:20,841
I will ride at first light.

658
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:33,086
We will all be together
again soon, I promise.

659
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,693
You've done so well.

660
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:45,865
Your father
would be... proud.

661
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,610
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- <i>King</i> Renly.

662
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,715
There's a king
in every corner now.

663
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:16,196
What is all this?

664
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:18,499
Returning this room
to its proper appearance.

665
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:21,401
Say what you will about the Targaryens--
they were conquerors.

666
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:24,271
That is a seat
for a conqueror.

667
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,974
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

668
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:30,376
We can't find Arya Stark.

669
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:32,545
With luck, she's dead
in a ditch somewhere.

670
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,547
Perhaps. But if not,
we need her.

671
00:45:34,581 --> 00:45:36,916
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

672
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:39,552
I think they might.
They're weak.

673
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:41,421
They put too much value
on their women.

674
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:45,291
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

675
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,193
Send out as many men
as we can.

676
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:49,029
I'm sure if you asked
grandfather--

677
00:45:49,063 --> 00:45:53,066
The King does not ask;
He commands.

678
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,969
And my grandfather's
stupidity in the field of battle

679
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,905
is the reason Robb Stark has
Uncle Jaime in the first place.

680
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:01,640
His life is in danger.

681
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,309
We're at war.

682
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,444
All our lives
are in danger.

683
00:46:09,448 --> 00:46:12,951
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime.

684
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:14,619
And you.

685
00:46:15,788 --> 00:46:17,289
Our enemies
will say anything

686
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:19,324
to weaken your claim
to the throne.

687
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,494
It's not a claim.
The throne is mine.

688
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:24,898
Of course it is.

689
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,769
No one believes
this foul gossip.

690
00:46:28,803 --> 00:46:30,938
Someone believes it.

691
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:34,908
Father had
other children?

692
00:46:34,943 --> 00:46:37,478
Besides me and Tommen
and Myrcella?

693
00:46:39,281 --> 00:46:41,248
What are you asking?

694
00:46:41,282 --> 00:46:43,684
I'm asking if he fucked
other women

695
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:45,253
when he grew tired
of you.

696
00:46:45,287 --> 00:46:47,088
How many bastards
does he have running--

697
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:07,073
What you just did
is punishable by death.

698
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:13,212
You will never
do it again.

699
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,181
Never.

700
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:23,322
That will be all,
Mother.

701
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,031
No, no, no, no.

702
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:34,868
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

703
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:36,370
Ease into it.

704
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:39,406
Slowly, with passion.

705
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,177
Oh, yeah.

706
00:47:43,212 --> 00:47:47,081
Go wash yourselves.
Put some clothes on.

707
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:49,718
Both of you
are working tonight.

708
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:55,456
We do things
differently here, Daisy.

709
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,459
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

710
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:01,994
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

711
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:03,863
Our establishment
doesn't cater

712
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:06,665
to ploughmen
and goat herders.

713
00:48:06,699 --> 00:48:08,800
Lord Olsen.

714
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,535
Taste is
everything here.

715
00:48:10,569 --> 00:48:12,437
Littlefinger's
a fancy man.

716
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:14,239
Don't call him
Littlefinger.

717
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:15,707
He doesn't like it.

718
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:18,210
<i>Lord Baelish.</i>

719
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,985
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

720
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,588
so that people
will think she's exotic.

721
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:31,525
She grew up just down the road
in flea bottom.

722
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,128
She's beautiful.

723
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:37,398
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

724
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,772
Lord Commander.

725
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:47,941
Good to see you...
Again.

726
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:04,392
You do realize
this establishment

727
00:49:04,427 --> 00:49:06,762
is owned by
Lord Petyr Baelish,

728
00:49:06,797 --> 00:49:08,964
the King's
Master of Coin...

729
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:10,933
Coin which goes
in many pockets.

730
00:49:10,968 --> 00:49:13,670
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

731
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:16,705
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

732
00:49:34,323 --> 00:49:37,859
No, you can't.
No! Please!

733
00:49:37,894 --> 00:49:40,562
No! Not my Barra!

734
00:49:40,596 --> 00:49:43,999
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

735
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:46,067
- <i>Kill the bastard.</i>
<i>- No, no!</i>

736
00:49:46,102 --> 00:49:48,603
- <i>Please.</i>
- Give it here.

737
00:49:48,638 --> 00:49:51,173
No, please.

738
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:03,418
<i>Spread out.</i>
<i>Search every house.</i>

739
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:06,020
<i>Every room.</i>
<i>Look in every room.</i>

740
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:22,536
People shouting )

741
00:50:30,478 --> 00:50:32,979
Gendry!
His name is Gendry.

742
00:50:33,014 --> 00:50:34,881
Where is
the bastard?

743
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:37,517
The Night's Watch!
Please, stop!

744
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:38,918
Where?

745
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,921
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

746
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:45,557
- How will we know him?
- <i>He's got a bull's head helmet.</i>

747
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:48,826
- <i>He made it himself.</i>
- Find him.
