1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,290
A cripple?

2
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:15,193
You let a cripple escape?

3
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:18,058
<i>The boy can't walk,</i>

4
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:20,064
but somehow
he slipped past you?

5
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,701
The giant must have
took him.

6
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:26,003
The giant?

7
00:02:27,306 --> 00:02:29,540
Hodor?

8
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:32,176
Oh, well,
that's all right, then.

9
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:35,679
You let a halfwit
escape with a cripple.

10
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,614
And Rickon, too?
The little one?

11
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:41,184
Gone along with
the wildling woman,

12
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,787
the one you were fucking.

13
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:54,663
( Grunting )

14
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,700
<i>( Man groaning )</i>

15
00:02:57,734 --> 00:03:01,537
( Panting )

16
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:07,009
Right, get the horses
and the hounds.

17
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,680
- ( Dogs barking )
- Come on, find the scent.

18
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,688
Come on,
where they going?

19
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,731
Halt!

20
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,471
Enjoying
your first hunt?

21
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,707
So far, hunting seems very similar
to riding, My Lord.

22
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,210
With hunting,
there's blood at the end.

23
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:42,177
They're little boys.

24
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,626
I was a little boy
when I was torn away from

25
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:45,580
my home and brought here.

26
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,181
So I kept my word.

27
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:49,150
I never ran away.

28
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,287
If I find them soon enough,
I won't hurt them.

29
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:56,358
Well, I'll hurt them,
but I won't kill them.

30
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:59,428
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

31
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,463
They have no value
to me missing.

32
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:04,033
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

33
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:07,270
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

34
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:10,006
<i>She'll get here</i>
<i>long before they do.</i>

35
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,690
And Ned Stark always
said 500 men could hold

36
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,310
Winterfell against 10,000.

37
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:17,246
- <i>( Dogs barking )</i>
- Man: <i>We have a scent!</i>

38
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,881
The hounds have the scent.

39
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,417
Come, Maester,
don't look so grim.

40
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:25,219
It's all just a game.

41
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,303
Osha: We should have
took more food.

42
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:44,472
We couldn't risk
going to the kitchens.

43
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:45,974
Those people
all love you.

44
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:47,409
They would have given
you whatever you needed.

45
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:49,278
And if Theon found out,
he'd hang them.

46
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:52,280
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

47
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:56,584
We've been walking
since before sunrise.

48
00:04:56,618 --> 00:04:59,053
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

49
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:02,056
- Even you, sweet giant.
- ( Chuckles ) Hodor.

50
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:05,826
<i>( Children shouting )</i>

51
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,862
Wait, I know that farm.

52
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:10,697
<i>I sent those two</i>
<i>Winterfell orphans there.</i>

53
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:12,666
Jack and Billy.

54
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,434
They'll give us some food.

55
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:15,535
We can't risk it.

56
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,237
If Theon tracks us here,
he'll torture them

57
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:19,239
until he finds out
where we are.

58
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,675
Billy climbs a tree
better than anyone.

59
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,443
You've never seen me
climb a tree, little man.

60
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:25,979
<i>They'll be after us</i>
<i>with hounds.</i>

61
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:27,581
<i>We got a good start</i>
<i>on them,</i>

62
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:30,050
but we can't outrun
hounds forever.

63
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,179
Did you pull a knife
on me in the night?

64
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:09,889
What's the matter?

65
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:11,791
Can't be the first time
you pressed your bone

66
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,426
against a woman's ass.

67
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,396
Let's move.

68
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:25,571
Oh, it is
the first time.

69
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:28,808
How old are you, boy?

70
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:31,611
I'm a man
of the Night's Watch.

71
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:36,216
You're a boy who's
never been with a girl.

72
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,622
Don't your stones
start to hurt

73
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:44,225
if your bone
never gets--

74
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,360
Don't call them that.

75
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:49,697
What, stones?

76
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:51,399
Or bone?

77
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,835
Neither.

78
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:56,170
Both.

79
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,740
Move!

80
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,547
Ygritte: I heard they get
all swollen

81
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:08,916
and bruised if you
don't use them.

82
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,718
Of course, maybe that's
just what the lads say

83
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:13,387
when they want me
feeling sorry for them.

84
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,756
As if I'd feel
sorry for them.

85
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:19,360
Are there
no girl crows?

86
00:07:20,695 --> 00:07:23,163
There are no women
of the Night's Watch, no.

87
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:25,265
So the lads just do it
with each other?

88
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:27,167
No.

89
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,702
- Never?
- Never.

90
00:07:29,736 --> 00:07:32,305
We swore an oath.

91
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,641
You have sheep
at the Wall?

92
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,845
With your hands, then?

93
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,016
No wonder
you're all so miserable.

94
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,518
Would you please shut up?

95
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,687
( Mocking )
Would you please shut up?

96
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,257
You think you're
better than me, crow.

97
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,826
- I'm a free woman--
- You're a free woman?

98
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,129
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

99
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:56,097
If you're my prisoner,
you're not a free woman.

100
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,732
That's what
"prisoner" means.

101
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,834
And you think you're free?

102
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,837
You swore
some stupid oath

103
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:04,339
and now you can never
touch a girl.

104
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:06,841
It was my choice
to say the words.

105
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,743
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

106
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:10,745
But you chose
never to touch them.

107
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,482
That's the price you pay if you want
to be a man of the Night's Watch.

108
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,350
So instead of getting
naked with a girl,

109
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:16,919
you'd prefer
to invade our lands--

110
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,620
Invade your lands?

111
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,589
Wildlings raid
our lands all the time.

112
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:23,526
Some of them tried to kill my
little brother, a crippled boy!

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,529
They're not your lands!

114
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,598
We've been here
the whole time.

115
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,523
You lot came along
and just put up a big wall

116
00:08:29,548 --> 00:08:31,202
and said it was yours.

117
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:33,838
My father was Ned Stark.

118
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:35,840
I have the blood
of the First Men.

119
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:39,110
My ancestors lived here,
same as yours.

120
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:43,548
So why are you
fighting us?

121
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,702
Go on.

122
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:09,277
Now I want you
to tell me what happened.

123
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:12,514
- Guard: <i>Come on, this way.</i>
- <i>( Man screaming )</i>

124
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:16,150
<i>Come on, speak up.</i>
<i>Speak up.</i>

125
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,388
( Sniffs )

126
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:24,090
Wolfsbane--

127
00:09:24,124 --> 00:09:26,693
a rare substance.

128
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:29,161
This is no common assassin.

129
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,330
We hanged 20 men
last night.

130
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:34,166
I don't care
if you hanged 100.

131
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,701
A man tried to kill me.

132
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,770
I want his name
and I want his head.

133
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,272
Mountain: <i>We think it was</i>
<i>an infiltrator</i>

134
00:09:39,306 --> 00:09:42,142
from the Brotherhood
Without Banners.

135
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:44,945
Pretentious name
for a band of outlaws.

136
00:09:44,979 --> 00:09:47,547
We can't allow rebels
behind our lines

137
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:49,650
to harass us
with impunity.

138
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,785
We look like fools
and they look like heroes.

139
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,553
<i>That's how kings fall.</i>

140
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,756
I want them dead,
every one.

141
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,557
Killing them
isn't the problem.

142
00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:59,527
<i>It's finding them.</i>

143
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:01,829
Have you gone soft,
Clegane?

144
00:10:01,863 --> 00:10:03,964
I always thought you had
a talent for violence.

145
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:07,601
Burn the villages,
burn the farms.

146
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:10,004
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

147
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,472
Mmm.

148
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:16,177
Is that mutton?

149
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:17,712
Yes, My Lord.

150
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:19,314
Don't like mutton.

151
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:22,283
I'll bring
something else.

152
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:24,419
Leave it.

153
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:27,955
- Are you hungry?
- No.

154
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,623
Of course you are.

155
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:31,191
Eat.

156
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:34,461
I'll eat
in the kitchen later.

157
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:38,665
It's bad manners
to refuse a Lord's offer.

158
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,801
Sit.

159
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:43,370
Eat.

160
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,907
You're small for your age.

161
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:51,544
I suppose you've been
underfed your whole life.

162
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:53,279
I eat a lot.

163
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:56,483
- <i>I just don't grow.</i>
- Hmm.

164
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:03,691
This will be my last war,

165
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,860
win or lose.

166
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,964
Have you ever
lost before?

167
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:12,001
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

168
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:22,679
But this is the one
I'll be remembered for.

169
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:25,349
<i>The "War of Five Kings"</i>
<i>they're calling it.</i>

170
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:29,921
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

171
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,359
Do you know
what legacy means?

172
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,930
It's what you pass down
to your children

173
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,333
and your children's
children.

174
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,403
It's what remains of you
when you're gone.

175
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:52,310
Harren the Black thought this castle
would be his legacy.

176
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,681
The greatest fortress
ever built--

177
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,251
the tallest towers,
the strongest walls.

178
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,822
The Great Hall
had 35 hearths.

179
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,992
35. Can you imagine?

180
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,660
Look at it now--

181
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,663
<i>a blasted ruin.</i>

182
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,766
Do you know
what happened?

183
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,101
Dragons?

184
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:21,206
Yes, dragons happened.

185
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:28,146
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

186
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,417
A million men could have marched
on these walls

187
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,820
and a million men
would have been repelled.

188
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:41,458
But an attack from the air
with dragon fire-- mm.

189
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,894
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

190
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:49,865
Aegon Targaryen
changed the rules.

191
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,867
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

192
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:55,003
300 years after his death.

193
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:57,406
Aegon and his sisters.

194
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,008
Mm?

195
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:03,278
It wasn't just Aegon
riding his dragon.

196
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:05,147
It was Rhaenys
and Visenya, too.

197
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,450
Correct.

198
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:09,719
A student of history,
are you?

199
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:12,222
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

200
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,091
Visenya rode Vhagar.

201
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:18,395
I'm sure I knew that
when I was a boy.

202
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,734
Visenya Targaryen
was a great warrior.

203
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,670
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

204
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,006
Hmm.

205
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,209
She's a heroine
of yours, I take it?

206
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,111
Aren't most girls
more interested

207
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,080
in the pretty maidens
from the songs?

208
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,214
<i>Jonquil with the flowers</i>
<i>in her hair?</i>

209
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,717
- Most girls are idiots.
- <i>Ha!</i>

210
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,586
You remind me
of my daughter.

211
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:46,189
Where did you learn
all this stuff

212
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:50,226
about Visenya and her
Valyrian Steel sword?

213
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:53,129
From my father.

214
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,735
He was a well-read
stonemason.

215
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,040
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stonemason.

216
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,844
Have you met many
stonemasons, My Lord?

217
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,249
Careful now, girl.

218
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:12,485
<i>I enjoy you,</i>
<i>but be careful.</i>

219
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,354
Take that back
to the kitchen.

220
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,156
Eat what you want.

221
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,227
And, girl.

222
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,998
M'lord.

223
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,068
Lowborn girls
say "M'lord,"

224
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,471
<i>not "My Lord."</i>

225
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,740
If you're going
to pose as a commoner,

226
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,909
you should do it
properly.

227
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,045
My mother served
Lady Dustin

228
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,014
for many years,
My Lord.

229
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,518
She taught me how to speak
proper-- properly.

230
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,122
You're too smart
for your own good.

231
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,358
- <i>Has anyone told you that?</i>
- Yes.

232
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,061
Go on.

233
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,708
I beg pardon, Ser.

234
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,044
I should have
come to you after

235
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,380
to thank you
for saving me.

236
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,749
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

237
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:21,319
A dog doesn't need courage
to chase off rats.

238
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,121
Does it give you joy
to scare people?

239
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:27,058
No. It gives me joy
to kill people.

240
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,359
Spare me.
You can't tell me

241
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:32,362
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

242
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,565
It was his duty.
He never liked it.

243
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,667
Is that what he told you?

244
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:40,135
He lied.

245
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:43,105
Killing is the sweetest
thing there is.

246
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,773
Why are you always
so hateful?

247
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:47,575
You'll be glad
of the hateful things I do

248
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,378
someday when you're queen
and I'm all that stands

249
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:52,881
between you
and your beloved king.

250
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,127
I've demanded a meeting
of the Thirteen.

251
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,962
One of them did this
or knows who did.

252
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,564
You are one
of the Thirteen.

253
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,633
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

254
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,936
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

255
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,572
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

256
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:18,341
Shall we look inside my vault and see
what selling your dragons

257
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,343
would buy me
I cannot buy already?

258
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:22,511
We will get them back.

259
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,379
There is no we,

260
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,915
so why would you help me
get them back?

261
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,716
I took you
under my protection

262
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:30,818
in front of the rulers
of my city.

263
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:33,888
A man is what others
say he is and no more.

264
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:36,525
If they say that
Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,

265
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,995
my word is worth nothing.

266
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:41,598
I cannot let this thing
happen to you under my roof.

267
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:44,001
But it did happen
under your roof.

268
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:47,604
Khaleesi, many times
in my life I have been--

269
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,373
I don't care
where you've been.

270
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:16,230
You think we're savages because
we don't live in stone castles.

271
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:20,201
We can't make steel as good
as yours, it's true, but...

272
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:22,770
We're free.

273
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:24,597
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down

274
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:26,074
as man and woman,

275
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:28,643
we'd shove a spear
up his ass.

276
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,612
We don't go serving
some shit king

277
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,213
who's only king
because his father was.

278
00:17:32,248 --> 00:17:35,651
No. No, you serve
Mance Rayder,

279
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:37,085
the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

280
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,022
We chose Mance Rayder
to lead us.

281
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:42,425
He was a crow,
same as you,

282
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,727
but he wanted
to be free.

283
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:49,233
You could be free, too.

284
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,867
You don't need to live
your whole life

285
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,102
taking commands
from old men.

286
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:56,105
Wake up when you want
to wake up.

287
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:59,041
I could show you the streams
to fish, the woods to hunt.

288
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:03,277
<i>Build yourself a cabin and find</i>
<i>a woman to lie with in the night.</i>

289
00:18:05,113 --> 00:18:06,880
You're a pretty lad.

290
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:10,283
The girls would claw each other's
eyes out to get naked with you.

291
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:15,422
Walk.

292
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,725
I could teach you
how to do it.

293
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,961
I know how to do it.

294
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:26,801
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

295
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:50,291
( Chatter )

296
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:57,264
And what did she say?

297
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,933
She admired your spirit,
Your Grace.

298
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,968
And what then?

299
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,140
She, uh...

300
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:08,142
If every man
were held accountable

301
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:10,144
for the actions
of every distant relative,

302
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:13,347
Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

303
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:19,720
She tore the paper
in half, Your Grace.

304
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:21,255
You've acted with honor.

305
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,357
I thank you for it.

306
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:26,427
Lord Karstark, see that
Ser Alton's pen is clean.

307
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:27,928
And give him a hot supper.

308
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:30,432
Ser Alton's pen
is occupied, Your Grace.

309
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,001
The prisoners
from the Yellow Fork.

310
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:35,070
Too many prisoners.

311
00:19:35,105 --> 00:19:37,840
Is there room
for Ser Alton?

312
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,077
Does he need
to lie down?

313
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:45,349
Have the men
build him a new pen.

314
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:48,018
<i>Put him in with</i>
<i>the Kingslayer for now.</i>

315
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,221
Have your boy
watch over them.

316
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,890
Torrhen.

317
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:54,558
That will be all.

318
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,765
Your Grace.

319
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,034
<i>A minute of your time?</i>

320
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,485
I've been treating
your wounded men.

321
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,131
And my enemies
as some of my bannermen

322
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,823
are fond of mentioning.

323
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,458
They're not my enemies.

324
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,594
That's what I tell
my bannermen.

325
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,330
I've already run through the
supplies I brought with me.

326
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,764
Some are easily replaced--

327
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,767
egg yolks, turpentine,
oil of roses.

328
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:39,203
But some are not.

329
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:42,305
I need silk
for stitching.

330
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:46,576
I need fennel root
for those with fever, willow bark.

331
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,811
Mostly I need
milk of the poppy.

332
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:52,014
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

333
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:54,061
I assume there will be
more loss of limb before

334
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,651
this war is over.

335
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:59,689
- If you need help finding these--
- I know where to find them.

336
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,527
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
interrupt you.

337
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,864
Continue, My Lady.

338
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,931
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

339
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:13,846
Yes.

340
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,409
The Crag will have a Maester
and he will have what I need.

341
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,610
I expect he will.

342
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,579
If I could write a list--

343
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,014
come with me
to the Crag.

344
00:21:25,516 --> 00:21:27,150
I don't think
that will be--

345
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,486
Let the Maester
show you his stores.

346
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,656
I want the wounded men
to be treated well--

347
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:35,592
all the wounded men.

348
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,198
<i>( Dog barking )</i>

349
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,669
Woman:
<i>Children, come inside, quick.</i>

350
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,872
Hurry up!

351
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,075
- <i>( Dog barking )</i>
- Man: <i>Can't find anything, Ser.</i>

352
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,945
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

353
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,547
We've circled
this farmhouse twice.

354
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,182
There's no sign of them.

355
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:01,086
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, My Lord.

356
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,022
I'm looking at spending
the rest of life

357
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,992
being treated like a fool and
a eunuch by my own people.

358
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:08,027
Ask yourself, "Is there anything
I wouldn't do

359
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,629
to stop that
from happening?"

360
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,831
The hounds will find
the scent again.

361
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:14,133
I'll beat them
until they do.

362
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,534
I'll whip every man here

363
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,036
<i>until I have</i>
<i>both those boys in hand.</i>

364
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,038
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

365
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,908
It's better to be
cruel than weak.

366
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,176
Prince Theon.

367
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:29,345
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

368
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:30,579
The Stark boys.
Where are they?

369
00:22:30,614 --> 00:22:32,848
I don't know.
I seen no one.

370
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:34,784
Oh!

371
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:36,252
Think harder.

372
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:40,457
I swear, m'lord,
I don't know.

373
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,394
My Lord, over here.

374
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,867
I think I've found
what we're looking for.

375
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,912
Send the old man home.

376
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,784
Go back to Winterfell.

377
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,653
Take him back.

378
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:14,391
Theon, don't do this.

379
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,430
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

380
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,611
You came back.

381
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:36,746
As soon as I heard.

382
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:39,349
Do you know anything?

383
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:42,419
- Irri is dead.
- <i>I know.</i>

384
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,656
- She was a good--
- she's dead.

385
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,458
She died alone.

386
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,960
She died for me
and I couldn't protect her.

387
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:52,730
Doreah?

388
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,799
We can't find her.

389
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,936
She must be dead, too.

390
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,105
I led my people
out of the Red Waste

391
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,707
and into
the slaughterhouse.

392
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,810
I should have been here.

393
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,180
You went to find me
a ship.

394
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,382
My place is by your side.

395
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,784
I shouldn't have left you
alone with these people.

396
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,452
These people?

397
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,954
They are not
to be trusted.

398
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,623
And who is to be trusted?

399
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:21,224
Who are my people?

400
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,460
The Targaryens?

401
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,362
I only knew one--
my brother,

402
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:27,597
and he would have let
1,000 men rape me

403
00:24:27,631 --> 00:24:29,699
if it had got him
the crown.

404
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,334
The Dothraki?

405
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:33,557
Most of them turned on me
the day that Khal Drogo

406
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:35,038
fell from his horse.

407
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,806
Your people
are in Westeros.

408
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:39,542
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

409
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:41,611
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

410
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,847
They'll pray for my return?

411
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,350
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

412
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:49,521
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

413
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,990
You are not your brother.

414
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,592
Trust me, Khaleesi.

415
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,761
There it is--

416
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:59,030
"trust me."

417
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,666
And it's you I should trust,
Ser Jorah?

418
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,634
Only you?

419
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,773
I don't need trust
any longer.

420
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:12,642
I don't want it and I don't have
room for it.

421
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,811
You are too young
to be so--

422
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:17,047
And you are too familiar.

423
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,954
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

424
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,660
No one can survive
in this world without help.

425
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,128
No one.

426
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,765
Let me help you, please.

427
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,567
Tell me how.

428
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,870
Find my dragons.

429
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:49,448
Ygritte: How long till we get
back to your crows?

430
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,584
We're close.

431
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,122
What, a day?
A half-day?

432
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,728
You don't know, do you?

433
00:26:02,763 --> 00:26:05,665
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

434
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:09,669
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

435
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,772
Nothing happened
between you and me.

436
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:15,176
"I swear it,
old master king crow, Ser,

437

we were only close
together for warmth.

438
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:19,581
And then I felt it,

439
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:22,317
right up against
me backside like a club.

440

I can show you the bruise
on me tailbone.

441
00:26:24,854 --> 00:26:28,289
And before I knew
what was where, his-- his--

442
00:26:28,324 --> 00:26:31,259
well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

443
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:35,330
And I didn't want to want it,
but, oh, I did!

444
00:26:35,364 --> 00:26:38,332
And he spread me legs
and-- ruined.

445
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:40,034
The shame of it.

446
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:42,203
Now I can never marry
a perfumed lord.

447
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:43,933
What will me poor
savage father say?"

448
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,907
Turn back around.

449
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,043

but he said,

I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

your word against mine,

about it without blushing,

we may as well just.

What, right here

I'll keep you
warm enough.

Are you that afraid
of it?

00:29:33,476 --> 00:29:36,311
- Where are you going?
- To tell her Grace.

480
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,315
You'll say nothing
to anyone.

481
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:42,450
Do you understand?

482
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:05,941
Your mother might have
prepared you.

483
00:30:05,976 --> 00:30:08,344
You flowered, my dear.
No more.

484
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:11,547
My mother told me, but I
thought it would be different.

485
00:30:11,582 --> 00:30:13,082
In what way?

486
00:30:13,117 --> 00:30:16,286
I thought
it would be less--

487
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:19,423
less messy.

488
00:30:19,457 --> 00:30:22,226
Wait until you bear
the child.

489
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:25,363
You're a woman now.

490
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:28,466
Do you have any idea
what that means?

491
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:31,002
I'm fit to bear children
for the king?

492
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,472
A prospect that
once delighted you--

493
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:35,941
bringing little princes
and princesses into the world,

494
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:39,677
the greatest honor
for a queen.

495
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:47,050
Joffrey has always
been difficult.

496
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:49,185
Even his birth,
I labored a day and a half

497
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:51,287
to bring him
into this world.

498
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:53,756
You cannot imagine
the pain.

499
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,692
I screamed so loudly,
I was sure

500
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,194
Robert would hear me
in the Kingswood.

501
00:30:57,228 --> 00:31:00,263
His Grace was not
with you?

502
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:01,798
Robert was hunting.

503
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,701
That was his custom.

504
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:09,040
Whenever my time was near,

505
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,677
my royal husband
would flee to the trees

506
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:16,548
with his huntsmen
and his hounds.

507
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,116
And when he returned,
he would present me

508
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:21,352
with some pelts
or a stag's head,

509
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,253
and I would present him
with a baby.

510
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:27,691
Not that I wanted
him there, mind you.

511
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:30,760
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives,

512
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:32,762
and I had my brother.

513
00:31:32,796 --> 00:31:36,133
When they told Jaime he wasn't
allowed in the birthing room,

514
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:39,503
he smiled and asked
which one of them

515
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:41,671
proposed to keep him out.

516
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:47,345
Joffrey will show you
no such devotion.

517
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:52,284
You may never
love the king,

518
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:54,185
but you will love
his children.

519
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,589
I love his Grace
with all my heart.

520
00:31:57,623 --> 00:32:00,491
That's so very
touching to hear.

521
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:07,264
Permit me to share
some womanly wisdom with you

522
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:10,300
on this very special day.

523
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:14,136
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

524
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,740
You'll do things for them that
you know you shouldn't do.

525
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:21,477
You'll act the fool to make them
happy, to keep them safe.

526
00:32:23,847 --> 00:32:26,715
Love no one
but your children.

527
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:30,318
On that front,
a mother has no choice.

528
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:34,990
But... shouldn't
I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

529
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,162
You can try,

530
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:42,165
little dove.

531
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:50,073
<i>( Chatter )</i>

532
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:00,684
Who did you say
your mother was again?

533
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:02,485
Cinda Lannister.

534
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,287
Is she the fat one?

535
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:07,056
Well, perhaps she's gotten
a little larger than she--

536
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,859
No, no. There's only one
fat Lannister.

537
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:13,763
If she was your mother,
you'd know it.

538
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:18,568
I-- I squired
for you once, you know?

539
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:21,204
When?

540
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:24,641
The tournament the day
of Willem Frey's wedding.

541
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,712
I went to
Willem Frey's wedding?

542
00:33:27,746 --> 00:33:29,547
<i>You did.</i>

543
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:32,016
Your squire had gotten
so drunk the night before that he--

544
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,185
He threw up on his horse

545
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:35,753
on the way
to the tourney grounds.

546
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:38,322
- What was his name?
- Bryan.

547
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:41,524
( Laughs )
Poor lad.

548
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,561
That was my brother's doing,
I seem to recall.

549
00:33:46,763 --> 00:33:48,931
I remember you.

550
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:51,833
You had never squired
for anyone before.

551
00:33:51,867 --> 00:33:53,802
That's right.
I ran up and volunteered.

552
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:57,205
"Let me, My Lord.
Let me."

553
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,674
My father was furious,

554
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:01,443
afraid I'd embarrass
our family

555
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:03,911
in front of <i>the</i> family.

556
00:34:06,014 --> 00:34:07,481
You didn't, though.

557
00:34:07,516 --> 00:34:09,983
- You really remember?
- Mm.

558
00:34:10,018 --> 00:34:12,519
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away.

559
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,087
It's a rare talent.

560
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:17,890
Most of my squires,
they mean well,

561
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:21,361
but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

562
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,262
Well, when I think
back to that day--

563
00:34:23,297 --> 00:34:25,064
( hisses )

564
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:35,073
You were saying?

565
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,510
I--

566
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:40,446
never mind.
It's embarrassing.

567
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:43,183
More embarrassing
than being chained to a post

568
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,985
covered in your own shit?

569
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:48,990
I remember everything
about that day--

570
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:51,359
your helmet, your horse,

571
00:34:51,394 --> 00:34:54,095
the rake line in the dirt
along the list,

572
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,597
where the sun was
in the sky

573
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:57,832
when you knocked
Balon Swann from his horse,

574
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:01,069
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

575
00:35:03,138 --> 00:35:06,040
I'll remember it all
until I die.

576
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:09,577
That was the best day
of my life.

577
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,517
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

578
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,019
All the competitors
were done.

579
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:20,055
I was the last one
out there.

580
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:24,826
And I couldn't leave.

581
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:27,129
<i>I couldn't bring myself</i>
<i>to go and sit with my family</i>

582
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:29,331
at a table so far
on the edge of the feast

583
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:31,700
you could barely
even see the bride.

584
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:34,168
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you

585
00:35:35,138 --> 00:35:36,685
when I knew that they could
never have the faintest idea

586
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,001
what I was talking about.

587
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:41,977
I understand completely.

588
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:45,047
How could you?

589
00:35:45,082 --> 00:35:47,984
S-sorry, I-- I didn't
mean to doubt you.

590
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:51,520
- It's just that I--
- I was 16 once.

591
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:55,024
I also had to replace someone's
squire on short notice.

592
00:35:55,058 --> 00:35:56,726
Which knight was it?

593
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,528
Barristan Selmy.

594
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:02,798
The fight against
the Kingswood outlaws.

595
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:05,501
Before your time.

596
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,036
What was he like?

597
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,805
( Sighs )

598
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,276
He was

599
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,145
a painter,

600
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:19,482
a painter
who only used red.

601
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:26,056
I couldn't imagine being
able to fight like that,

602
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,292
not back then.

603
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:30,682
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something

604
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:32,707
that perfect...

605
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:37,502
I don't need to explain
how that felt, not to you.

606
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:40,205
It's hard to put
into words.

607
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,375
It's like stepping
into a dream

608
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:46,578
you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember

609
00:36:46,613 --> 00:36:48,447
and finding out
that the dream

610
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:51,517
is more real
than your life.

611
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:57,057
Leaving
that battlefield was

612
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,192
like being dragged off
to prison.

613
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:02,596
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

614
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:06,367
I didn't have your gift.

615
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:09,738
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

616
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:13,074
I was awful,
a complete liability...

617
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:16,711
until one of the outlaws

618
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:20,314
decided to take on
a 16-year-old squire.

619
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:28,554
It's a good thing
I am who I am.

620
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:32,258
( Chuckles ) I'd have been useless
at anything else.

621
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:39,899
I'm not well-suited
for imprisonment.

622
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:41,635
Shocking, I know.

623
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:43,370
Some men are.

624
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:46,907
Ned Stark--
I imagine he made

625
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:50,378
an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

626
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:53,881
But me, though--
my life has left me

627
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:56,951
uniquely unfit
for constraint.

628
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,120
Have you thought about...?

629
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,755
Of course.

630
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:04,658
- Every day.
- And?

631
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:10,830
Good prisoners breed
good jailers, apparently.

632
00:38:10,864 --> 00:38:12,999
The Starks
are very careful.

633
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:18,338
But there is a way,
I think.

634
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:21,008
It wasn't possible
until now.

635
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:24,245
What is it?

636
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:31,353
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

637
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:34,189
You'll only have
to do one thing.

638
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:36,091
Tell me.

639
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,796
You'll have to die.

640
00:38:52,107 --> 00:38:54,208
<i>( Crunching )</i>

641
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:13,929
( Choking )

642
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:20,067
( Bone breaks )

643
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:28,476
<i>( Bird screeching )</i>

644
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:36,617
Jorah the Andal.

645
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:39,753
This man must sail
past old Valyria.

646
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:44,091
All who travel too close to
the Doom must have protection.

647
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,026
I didn't come here
for lessons.

648
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:48,329
No, you came
for the dragons.

649
00:39:48,363 --> 00:39:50,431
You have them?

650
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,601
Where are they?

651
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:55,636
Draw your sword.

652
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,339
See what your steel
is worth.

653
00:40:01,977 --> 00:40:05,946
You want to please
the Mother of Dragons.

654
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,353
You love her.

655
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,458
Where are the dragons?

656
00:40:19,827 --> 00:40:22,362
Will you betray her again,
Jorah the Andal?

657
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:29,769
Will you betray her again?

658
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:33,640
Never.

659
00:40:39,412 --> 00:40:41,646
<i>The thief you seek</i>

660
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,648
is with her now.

661
00:40:49,087 --> 00:40:51,421
Spice King: <i>I did not leave</i>
<i>the comfort of my home</i>

662
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:53,222
to come to yours
and be called a thief.

663
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:55,191
No one is calling you
a thief.

664
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:56,926
Who is she to accuse us?

665
00:40:56,961 --> 00:40:58,962
Please,
they're my children.

666
00:40:58,996 --> 00:41:01,264
- I'm begging you.
- Begging us?

667
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:03,733
It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

668
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,469
Without me,
the dragons will die.

669
00:41:06,504 --> 00:41:08,571
It will be
for the best.

670
00:41:08,606 --> 00:41:10,874
<i>Your dragons</i>
<i>will bring the world</i>

671
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:13,677
nothing but death
and misery, my dear.

672
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:16,113
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

673
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:18,082
Pyat Pree:
<i>You are cruel, my friend.</i>

674
00:41:18,116 --> 00:41:21,085
The mother of dragons
is in the right.

675
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,256
<i>She must be reunited</i>
<i>with her babies.</i>

676
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:28,160
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

677
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,864
I will take you
to the House of the Undying

678
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,866
where I have put them.

679
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:37,036
You have my dragons?

680
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,339
When I learned you were
coming to our city,

681
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:42,075
I made an arrangement
with the King of Qarth.

682
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:44,110
( Laughter )

683
00:41:44,144 --> 00:41:45,511
He procured them for me.

684
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:48,515
- But there is no King of Qarth.
- Xaro: There is now.

685
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,750
That was the other half
of the arrangement.

686
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:56,056
<i>You would keep your gates</i>
<i>and your minds closed</i>

687
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,227
to everything
outside your walls,

688
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:02,363
but Qarth cannot remain
the greatest city that ever was

689
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:04,032
if it refuses to change.

690
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:06,702
I will open Qarth
to the world

691
00:42:06,736 --> 00:42:11,007
as I have forced it
to open itself to me.

692
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:13,976
Your ambition
is an inspiration.

693
00:42:14,011 --> 00:42:17,046
But like all upstarts,
you overreach.

694
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,815
Three dragons
the size of cats

695
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,151
and an alliance
with a charlatan

696
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:24,687
do not make you a king.

697
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:26,922
An upstart
and a charlatan?

698
00:42:26,957 --> 00:42:29,992
<i>Empires have been</i>
<i>built by less.</i>

699
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:33,462
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

700
00:42:33,496 --> 00:42:35,830
and those in the center
make room for them,

701
00:42:35,865 --> 00:42:37,565
<i>willingly or otherwise.</i>

702
00:42:41,903 --> 00:42:45,272
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

703
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,375
She will give them
her love

704
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,178
and they will thrive
by her side...

705
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:55,415
forever.

706
00:43:15,271 --> 00:43:17,773
A mother should be
with her children.

707
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:23,580
Where will you run to,
Daenerys Stormborn?

708
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:26,917
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

709
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,254
Come see them.

710
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:40,399
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

711
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:42,167
Keep your hands
off me, woman.

712
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:45,871
Don't enter without
an invitation, <i>man.</i>

713
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,341
Forgive me.
Lady Stark.

714
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,044
- Catelyn: <i>What is it?</i>
- They caught the Kingslayer.

715
00:43:55,181 --> 00:43:57,916
( Men shouting )

716
00:43:57,918 --> 00:44:00,652
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
- Hang him!

717
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,289
( Men shouting )

718
00:44:04,324 --> 00:44:06,158
You'll die today.

719
00:44:06,192 --> 00:44:08,660
Justice for
the Karstark.

720
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:23,443
Gut him!

721
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:38,358
Get back!
I want his head!

722
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:42,028
Any man who stands
between a father

723
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:44,564
and his vengeance
asks for death.

724
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,833
Lord Karstark,

725
00:44:46,867 --> 00:44:49,769
this man
is our prisoner.

726
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:51,704
This monster
killed my son.

727
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:53,774
And crippled mine.

728
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:55,575
He will answer
for his crimes,

729
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,643
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>but not here.</i>

730
00:44:57,678 --> 00:44:59,980
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me--

731
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:02,415
You will strike me down?

732
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,751
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

733
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,853
<i>I am the widow of your</i>
<i>liege Lord Eddark Stark.</i>

734
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:08,388
I am the mother
of your king!

735
00:45:08,422 --> 00:45:11,257
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

736
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,427
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

737
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:17,197
Aye, gone to the Crag,
but not to negotiate.

738
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:19,132
He brought that
foreign bitch with him.

739
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:19,974
How dare you?

740
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,120
Threatening My Lady
is an act of treason.

741
00:45:22,204 --> 00:45:23,404
Treason?

742
00:45:23,438 --> 00:45:25,206
How can it be treason
to kill Lannisters?

743
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,308
I understand
your grief, My Lord--

744
00:45:27,343 --> 00:45:29,777
better than most
I understand it--

745
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,747
but in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

746
00:45:32,782 --> 00:45:34,816
stand down.

747
00:45:36,352 --> 00:45:38,119
When your son returns,

748
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:40,555
<i>I will demand</i>
<i>this murderer's head.</i>

749
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:42,824
Wise men do not
make demands of kings.

750
00:45:42,858 --> 00:45:46,060
Fathers who love
their sons do.

751
00:45:46,094 --> 00:45:48,429
I will have his head.

752
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:53,834
Thank you for fighting
on my behalf, Lady Stark.

753
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:55,702
I would have come
to your defense, but--

754
00:45:55,737 --> 00:45:58,404
Take him to the stockades.

755
00:45:58,439 --> 00:46:00,640
Bind him with every chain
you can find!

756
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,174
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

757
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:04,377
There's not much fish
left in you.

758
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:06,112
And gag him!

759
00:46:10,383 --> 00:46:13,485
Since when do you light
your own candles?

760
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:15,854
Since I decided that
I can't stand to look

761
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:19,424
at any of my handmaidens
for another instant.

762
00:46:20,794 --> 00:46:23,896
How many times can you
read one raven scroll?

763
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,600
Stannis Baratheon's fleet
has been spotted sailing north

764
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:30,270
past Tarth-- 200 ships.

765
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:34,441
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

766
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,843
He'll be at our gates
within five days,

767
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,578
four if he has the wind.

768
00:46:38,613 --> 00:46:41,348
We have strong,
high walls.

769
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,451
We'll rain fire
down on them from above.

770
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:46,620
"Rain fire on them
from above."

771
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:48,488
You're quoting father,
aren't you?

772
00:46:48,522 --> 00:46:49,956
Why not?

773
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:51,891
He has a good mind
for strategy, doesn't he?

774
00:46:51,926 --> 00:46:54,694
We call it tactics,
not strategy.

775
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,863
But, yes, he does have
a good mind for it.

776
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,732
The best mind,
some would say.

777
00:46:58,766 --> 00:47:00,734
Sadly, he's not here.

778
00:47:01,702 --> 00:47:04,037
It's just you,
me, and Joffrey,

779
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,239
the Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms

780
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:08,041
and protector of the realm.

781
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:11,511
I'm sure you'll make
a point eventually.

782
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:14,914
He needs to start
acting like a king.

783
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:18,117
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

784
00:47:18,152 --> 00:47:20,453
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead--

785
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:22,755
I'm not the one giving
the boy whores to abuse.

786
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:24,890
I thought the girls
might help him.

787
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:27,325
- Did you?
- <i>I was wrong.</i>

788
00:47:30,061 --> 00:47:32,629
If we can't
control him...

789
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:34,264
Do you think
I haven't tried?

790
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:39,503
He doesn't listen to me.

791
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:44,241
It's hard to put
a leash on a dog

792
00:47:44,275 --> 00:47:47,010
once you've put
a crown on its head.

793
00:47:50,214 --> 00:47:53,049
I always hoped
he'd be like Jaime.

794
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,354
He looks like him...

795
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:03,094
in a certain light.

796
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:07,433
The boy is more
Robert than Jaime.

797
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:11,437
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

798
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:16,542
Sometimes I wonder...

799
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:18,977
What?

800
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:22,414
If this is the price

801
00:48:22,448 --> 00:48:26,784
for what we've done,
for our sins.

802
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:28,853
Sins?

803
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:30,421
The Targaryens--

804
00:48:30,455 --> 00:48:32,034
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years,

805
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,059
I know.

806
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:39,330
That's what Jaime and I would say to
each other in our moments of doubt.

807
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:43,335
It's what I told Ned Stark when he
was stupid enough to confront me.

808
00:48:45,305 --> 00:48:48,508
Half the Targaryens
went mad, didn't they?

809
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:49,943
What's the saying?

810
00:48:49,977 --> 00:48:54,514
Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin.

811
00:48:54,548 --> 00:48:57,050
You've beaten the odds.

812
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:59,685
Tommen and Myrcella
are good, decent children,

813
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,554
both of them.

814
00:49:03,656 --> 00:49:05,791
( Crying )

815
00:49:29,013 --> 00:49:31,814
- Why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.

816
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:34,617
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

817
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:36,819
So is saving
Lannisters, yeah?

818
00:49:36,853 --> 00:49:39,621
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

819
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:42,157
Your son returns
at dawn, My Lady?

820
00:49:42,192 --> 00:49:43,759
So they say.

821
00:49:43,793 --> 00:49:46,629
Brienne: <i>The Kingslayer</i>
<i>won't last the night.</i>

822
00:49:46,663 --> 00:49:48,997
<i>The more they drink,</i>
<i>the angrier they'll get.</i>

823
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:52,400
And when the Karstarks
draw their swords...

824
00:49:52,435 --> 00:49:55,870
<i>who wants to die</i>
<i>defending a Lannister?</i>

825
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,474
Come.

826
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,760
I need to be alone
with him.

827
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:20,664
- My Lady, our orders--
- your orders, which I just gave you,

828
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:23,266
are to leave me
alone with him.

829
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,406
Come to say goodbye,
Lady Stark?

830
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:35,245
I believe it's my last night
in this world.

831
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,713
Is that a woman?

832
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:39,516
Do you hear them
out there?

833
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:42,186
They want your head.

834
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,689
Well, old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

835
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:48,959
You strangled his son
with your chains.

836
00:50:48,994 --> 00:50:51,262
Oh, oh.

837
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:52,930
Was he the one
on guard duty?

838
00:50:52,964 --> 00:50:55,499
<i>( Sighs )</i>

839
00:50:55,534 --> 00:50:57,335
He was in my way.

840
00:50:57,369 --> 00:50:58,969
Any Knight would have
done the same.

841
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:01,172
You are no Knight.

842
00:51:01,206 --> 00:51:03,775
You have forsaken
every vow you ever took.

843
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:05,576
So many vows.

844
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,378
They make you swear
and swear.

845
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,213
<i>Defend the king,</i>
<i>obey the king,</i>

846
00:51:10,248 --> 00:51:11,782
<i>obey your father,</i>

847
00:51:11,816 --> 00:51:15,085
protect the innocent,
defend the weak.

848
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,955
But what if your father
despises the king?

849
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:22,592
What if the king
massacres the innocent?

850
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:24,828
It's too much.

851
00:51:24,862 --> 00:51:28,398
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

852
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:31,267
Where did you find
this beast?

853
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:35,505
She is a truer Knight
than you will ever be,

854
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,841
Kingslayer.

855
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:40,477
Kingslayer.

856
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:42,812
What a king he was.

857
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:46,517
<i>Here's to Aerys Targaryen,</i>
<i>the second of his name,</i>

858
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:49,720
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the realm,

859
00:51:49,755 --> 00:51:53,725
and to the sword
I shoved in his back.

860
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:57,962
You are a man
without honor.

861
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:01,466
Do you know

862
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,736
I've never been with
any woman but Cersei?

863
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,605
So in my own way,

864
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:12,778
I have more honor
than poor old dead Ned.

865
00:52:14,414 --> 00:52:16,649
What was the name of that
bastard so in he fathered?

866
00:52:16,683 --> 00:52:20,287
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

867
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:24,491
Snow, a bastard
from the North.

868
00:52:24,526 --> 00:52:27,295
Now, when--
when good old Ned

869
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:30,732
came home with
some whore's baby,

870
00:52:30,766 --> 00:52:33,935
did you pretend
to love it?

871
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:38,139
<i>No. You're not very good</i>
<i>at pretending.</i>

872
00:52:38,173 --> 00:52:40,341
<i>You're an honest woman.</i>

873
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:43,744
You hated that boy,
didn't you?

874
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:46,213
<i>How could you not</i>
<i>hate him?</i>

875
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:48,848
<i>The walking,</i>
<i>talking reminder</i>

876
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:52,551
that the honorable
Lord Eddark Stark

877
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,321
fucked another woman.

878
00:52:57,658 --> 00:52:59,959
Your sword.

879
00:53:04,332 --> 00:53:07,669
I told you
what would happen.

880
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:09,971
All of you--

881
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:15,944
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally...

882
00:53:15,979 --> 00:53:18,147
<i>and what would happen</i>
<i>if you did not.</i>

883
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:21,016
What are you doing?
What have you done?

884
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,251
If there's any who still question
whether your new lord

885
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:24,920
means what he says...

886
00:53:27,557 --> 00:53:30,559
Here is the answer
to your question.

887
00:53:30,593 --> 00:53:33,762
<i>( Crowd gasps, murmurs )</i>

888
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,105
No!
