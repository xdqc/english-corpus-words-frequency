1
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,460
<i>- Rider approaching!</i>
<i>- Open the gate!</i>

2
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:38,794
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

3
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:42,231
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

4
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,934
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

5
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:48,103
I took the great castle
of Winterfell with 20 men.

6
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:49,504
You're a great warrior.

7
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,873
I saw the bodies
above your gates.

8
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:53,808
Which one gave you
the tougher fight,

9
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:55,442
the cripple or
the six-year-old?

10
00:02:57,812 --> 00:03:00,080
I treated the Stark
boys with honor

11
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,048
and they repaid me
with treachery.

12
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,218
You treated them with honor
by butchering them?

13
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,054
Before I had to kill them,
I treated them--

14
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:09,356
you seized their home,
as is your right.

15
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:12,126
- We're Ironborn; We take what we need.
- Exactly.

16
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,162
Then you made them prisoners in
their home and they ran away.

17
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:17,565
Is that treachery?

18
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,701
I'd call it bravery.

19
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,236
They made me a promise--

20
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,205
Your little boy prisoners
made you a promise

21
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,674
and you got mad
when they broke it?

22
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,408
Are you the dumbest
cunt alive?

23
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:29,444
- Don't call me a--
- A cunt.

24
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:33,647
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

25
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,949
You know how valuable
those boys were?

26
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,618
If I hadn't killed them, the
Northerners would think me weak.

27
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,788
You are weak.
And you're stupid.

28
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,224
I'm warning you.

29
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,992
Go on, then,

30
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,827
warn me.

31
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,400
You haven't brought
enough men.

32
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,835
How am I supposed to defend
Winterfell with just this lot?

33
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,938
You're not. I've come to bring
you home.

34
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,473
- Father wants a word.
- Is this a joke?

35
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,175
Winterfell is the heart
of the North.

36
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,112
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles
from the sea.

37
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,747
We're islanders,
baby brother.

38
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,315
<i>Had you forgotten that?</i>

39
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,051
<i>Our power comes</i>
<i>from our ships.</i>

40
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,153
<i>And now that you've</i>
<i>decorated your walls</i>

41
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,888
<i>with the bodies</i>
<i>of the Stark boys,</i>

42
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:20,791
every man in the North
wants to see you hanged.

43
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,160
When Robb Stark
finds out--

44
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:25,095
He won't find out.
We've killed all the ravens.

45
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,132
We have all the horses.

46
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,102
I've taken Winterfell.

47
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:34,906
And I will keep Winterfell.

48
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,444
Leave us.

49
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,093
Theon, you're my blood.

50
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:57,931
We both loved our mother.

51
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,101
We both endured
our father.

52
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,104
Come home with me.
Don't die here alone.

53
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,339
I don't intend to die.

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,914
You were a terrible baby,
do you know that?

55
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,285
Bawling all the time,
never sleeping.

56
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,389
And one night you just
wouldn't shut up,

57
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:27,094
screaming like a dying pig.

58
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:30,798
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

59
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:34,102
I wanted to strangle you.

60
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:37,239
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

61
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:41,010
You smiled at me.

62
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:47,650
Don't die
so far from the sea.

63
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,468
I've brought you
a present, Lord of Bones.

64
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:09,670
I already got one crow.
Don't need two.

65
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,872
Mance will want
to question this one.

66
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:14,775
<i>Knows all about where the crows</i>
<i>are and what they're planning.</i>

67
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,345
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

68
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,646
Gut him.

69
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,449
He could have killed me
half a dozen times.

70
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,251
And now he wishes he did.
Gut him.

71
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:29,556
He's a bastard of Winterfell,
Ned Stark's son.

72
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,095
Mance will want him.

73
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,164
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

74
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,933
I don't know.

75
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,836
I think he'll want
to decide for himself.

76
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,513
He runs, I'll chop
his balls off.

77
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:55,383
He runs,
I'll do it meself.

78
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:04,826
We're even now,
Jon Snow.

79
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,574
I couldn't do it.

80
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,442
I had the sword at her neck,
I just couldn't--

81
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,612
- I know.
- The others?

82
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,582
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

83
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,018
We found your tracks
fast enough.

84
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:34,188
But they found us
before we found you.

85
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:36,758
They died because of me.

86
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,961
See that it wasn't
for nothing.

87
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:41,463
All right, up, lad.

88
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:43,332
Come on,
on your feet, now.

89
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,133
Move it.

90
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:53,708
Is she beautiful?

91
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:55,909
I've never met her.

92
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:57,644
What's her name?

93
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,413
Frey, I suppose.

94
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,114
I don't know
her first name.

95
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,552
I'm sure you'll
be very happy.

96
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:10,124
And you're marrying
her for a bridge?

97
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,395
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

98
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:15,598
It was before
they killed my father.

99
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:19,669
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

100
00:08:19,704 --> 00:08:21,938
but only if I crossed
that bridge.

101
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:26,543
When I speak to people
from the North,

102
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:29,012
they all loved
your father.

103
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,549
He was the best man
I ever met.

104
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,485
I know children always think
that about their fathers, but--

105
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,255
Children do not always think that
about their fathers,

106
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,957
believe me.

107
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:44,862
He once told me that being
a Lord is like being a father,

108
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:47,231
except you have
thousands of children

109
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,567
and you worry about
all of them.

110
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:52,536
The farmers plowing
the fields are yours to protect.

111
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,873
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

112
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:59,644
The soldiers
you order into battle.

113
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,880
He told me he woke
with fear in the morning

114
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:04,182
and went to bed
with fear in the night.

115
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:08,987
I didn't believe him.

116
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,189
I asked him,

117
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:14,458
"how can a man be brave
if he's afraid?"

118
00:09:14,493 --> 00:09:18,029
"That is the only time
a man can be brave," he told me.

119
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,301
I wish I could have
met him.

120
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:26,703
He would have
liked you.

121
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,141
Most Lords worry more
about their gold

122
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:33,510
and their glory than the charwomen
scrubbing their floors.

123
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:35,735
He didn't care much
about gold or glory.

124
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,280
And you?

125
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:40,517
You think I'm fighting this war so
they'll sing songs about me?

126
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:43,820
I want to go home.

127
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:46,522
I want the men
following me to go home.

128
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:48,090
Then why don't you?

129
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,760
Because we'll never be safe until
the Lannisters are defeated.

130
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:53,995
And because I believe
in justice.

131
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,298
Chopping off
Joffrey's head, you mean.

132
00:09:56,332 --> 00:09:57,665
That would be a start.

133
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,744
Your Grace, Milady.

134
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,815
The Kingslayer,
he escaped in the night.

135
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:14,317
How?

136
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:18,722
How?!

137
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,395
Tell me this isn't true.

138
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,568
Why?

139
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:34,372
- For the girls.
- You betrayed me.

140
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:36,341
- Robb--
- No!

141
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,042
You knew I would
not allow it

142
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:40,411
and you did it
anyway.

143
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:44,115
Bran and Rickon
are captives in Winterfell.

144
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,452
Sansa and Arya are captives
in King's Landing.

145
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:50,255
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

146
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:53,992
I lost one son fighting
by your son's side.

147
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,994
I lost another
to the Kingslayer,

148
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:58,096
strangled with a chain.

149
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,365
You commit treason

150
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,735
<i>because your children</i>
<i>are prisoners?</i>

151
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,571
<i>I would carve out</i>
<i>my heart</i>

152
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:08,240
and offer it to the father
if he would let my sons

153
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:11,643
wake from their graves
and step into a prison cell.

154
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:13,378
I grieve for
your sons, My Lord.

155
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:16,048
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

156
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:18,817
And you stole it
from me.

157
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,587
Killing Jaime Lannister

158
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:23,789
would not buy life
for your children,

159
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,657
but returning him
to King's Landing

160
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:28,560
may buy life
for mine.

161
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:32,098
Jaime Lannister has played
you for a fool.

162
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:34,367
You've weakened
our position.

163
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:37,036
You've brought discord
into our camp.

164
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,706
And you did it all
behind my back.

165
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:45,011
Make sure she's guarded
day and night.

166
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:45,771
Robb.

167
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,796
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

168
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:49,216
40, Your Grace.

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,486
Send another 40
with our fastest horses.

170
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,155
Robb.

171
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,603
Whoa, oof!

172
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,541
Damn.

173
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:18,712
You're much uglier
in daylight.

174
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:21,181
What's your name?

175
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:24,184
I'm Jaime Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

176
00:12:24,218 --> 00:12:27,120
son of Tywin.

177
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:30,990
A captive Knight has a right
to know his captor's identity.

178
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:32,625
Brienne of Tarth.

179
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,293
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

180
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:37,529
Crescent moons
and starbursts.

181
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:41,332
Lord... Selwyn Tarth,

182
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,768
your father.

183
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:46,971
Do you have any brothers
and sisters, My Lady?

184
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,674
It's a long way
to King's Landing.

185
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:51,843
Might as well get
to know one another.

186
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:54,580
Have you known many men?

187
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:56,048
I suppose not.

188
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:57,683
Women?

189
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:00,252
Horses?
Ah!

190
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,221
I didn't mean to give
offense, My Lady.

191
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:03,311
Forgive me.

192
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,362
Your crimes are past
forgiveness, Kingslayer.

193
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,393
Why do you
hate me so much?

194
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:09,995
- <i>Have I ever harmed you?</i>
- <i>You've harmed others--</i>

195
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,564
<i>those you were</i>
<i>sworn to protect,</i>

196
00:13:12,598 --> 00:13:14,633
the weak,
the innocent.

197
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,836
Has anyone ever told you you're
as boring as you are ugly?

198
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,372
You will not
provoke me to anger.

199
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,908
I already have.
Look at you.

200
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,709
You're ready
to chop my head off.

201
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:27,512
Do you think
you could?

202
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:29,547
Do you think you could
beat me in a fair fight?

203
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,282
I've never
seen you fight.

204
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:33,318
The answer is no.

205
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:35,664
There are three men
in the kingdoms who might

206
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,854
have a chance against me.

207
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,356
You're not one of them.

208
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:41,493
All my life men like you
have sneered at me.

209
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:44,763
And all my life I've been knocking
men like you into the dust.

210
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:47,232
If you're so confident,
unlock my chains.

211
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:49,001
Let's see what happens.

212
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,104
Do you take me
for an idiot? In.

213
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,243
I took you
for a fighter,

214
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,180
a man-- pardon--
woman of honor.

215
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,683
Was I wrong?

216
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,451
You're afraid.

217
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,490
Maybe one day
we'll find out, Kingslayer.

218
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:25,670
<i>King's Landing</i>
<i>will fall an hour</i>

219
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:28,807
<i>after Stannis</i>
<i>lands his force.</i>

220
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:31,142
<i>It's not too late for</i>
<i>King Joffrey and Cersei</i>

221
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:34,512
<i>and the court</i>
<i>to ride west to safety.</i>

222
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,648
Surrender the Iron Throne?

223
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,685
Better than seeing their heads
mounted on the city gates.

224
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:42,320
Stannis will
execute them all.

225
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:45,490
No, a king who runs
will not be king for long.

226
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:48,293
He's a Lannister.
He'll stand and fight.

227
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,396
Stannis, two days
from the capital

228
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,164
and the wolf
at my doorstep.

229
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:57,234
The scouts assure us Robb Stark
remains north of Ashemark.

230
00:14:57,268 --> 00:15:00,136
Ha! The last time
the scouts assured us

231
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,872
of Stark's movement,
he lured us into a trap.

232
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:07,143
<i>Which is why my son</i>
<i>is his prisoner.</i>

233
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,917
<i>Too close</i>
<i>to Casterly Rock.</i>

234
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:16,488
He sent a splinter force

235
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:18,123
to recapture Winterfell.

236
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:20,359
The Greyjoys have
done us a great favor.

237
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:23,596
Stark won't risk marching
on Casterly Rock

238
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,197
until he's at full force.

239
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:28,934
He's a boy and he's
never lost a battle.

240
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:31,269
He'll risk anything
at any time

241
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:34,939
<i>because he doesn't know</i>
<i>enough to be afraid.</i>

242
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:44,347
We'll ride at nightfall.

243
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:47,617
<i>I want a full night's march before</i>
<i>he knows we're on the move.</i>

244
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:51,187
Clegane, you'll maintain
a Garrison here at Harrenhal.

245
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:54,724
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

246
00:15:56,993 --> 00:15:59,795
The girl has proven
herself a good servant.

247
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,231
<i>She'll stay on with you.</i>

248
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,500
<i>See that he doesn't get</i>
<i>drunk in the evenings.</i>

249
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:07,303
He's poor company
when he's sober,

250
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:10,006
but he's better
at his work.

251
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,381
You've got some
questions to answer.

252
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:21,449
<i>Who killed Ser Amory?</i>

253
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,151
- I don't know!
<i>- Give me the name.</i>

254
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:25,486
- Please!
<i>- Take this one out for the crows.</i>

255
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,857
<i>I told you, I don't know.</i>

256
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:30,993
<i>Please.</i>

257
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:33,762
Look, it's Yoren's
little cunt.

258
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:35,531
Used to be a boy,
now it's a girl.

259
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,468
Where's Jaqen?

260
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:40,137
Don't care.

261
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:43,273
Where's your stick
now, bitch?

262
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:44,774
I promised
to fuck you with it.

263
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:47,877
<i>Come on, time to kill</i>
<i>some wolves.</i>

264
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:59,021
You need sour cherries
to make it right.

265
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:01,172
<i>And the secret is you dry</i>
<i>the stones, and then you</i>

266
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:02,257
<i>break them with a mallet.</i>

267
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:04,059
<i>That's where</i>
<i>the real flavor is.</i>

268
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:05,727
<i>You crush 'em up real fine.</i>

269
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,964
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

270
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:09,833
- Where's Jaqen?
- How would I know?

271
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,668
I need him now.

272
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:13,403
Lord Tywin's
marching tonight.

273
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:16,139
- You need him?
- He's helping me.

274
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:18,642
- I saw him.
- Where?

275
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:22,646
- Where?!
- Ow!

276
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:23,444
Where?

277
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:25,116
They went riding out
the gates a few hours ago.

278
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:29,253
On patrol.
Let go of my ears.

279
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:36,027
What do you want
with him anyway?

280
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:53,712
Mance is gonna
march on the Wall.

281
00:17:53,746 --> 00:17:56,114
When he does, one brother
inside his army

282
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,950
will be worth 1,000
fighting against it.

283
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:00,153
- They'll never trust me.
- They might...

284
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,122
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

285
00:18:02,156 --> 00:18:04,692
How does it feel knowing
those men all died

286
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:07,779
so you could skip through the
snow with your little savage girl?

287
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,381
I didn't.

288
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:11,486
I should have known better,
trusting a traitor's bastard.

289
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,006
He's not yours
to kill, crow.

290
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:43,165
Do you have
to do that here?

291
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,836
I like to keep
me hands clean.

292
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,472
Yes, but do you
have to do it here?

293
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:01,282
You should start wearing
the gold cloak.

294
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,951
I don't want to wear
a gold cloak.

295
00:19:02,985 --> 00:19:05,453
<i>You're commander</i>
<i>of the City Watch.</i>

296
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:06,888
You shouldn't be dressed
like a common sellsword.

297
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,623
A cloak slows you down
in a fight,

298
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:10,692
makes it hard
to move quietly.

299
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,360
And the gold
catches the light,

300
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:14,529
so you're nice and easy
to spot at night.

301
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:17,399
Well, you're not sneaking
through alleyways any longer.

302
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:19,300
You're supposed
to stand out.

303
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:22,437
We had a deal, and wearing
a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

304
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:24,373
Fine, fine.

305
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:28,144
No gold cloak.

306
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:37,554
- What?
- What?

307
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,890
What? What?
Why are you staring at me?

308
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,927
You don't want me
cleaning me nails.

309
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:44,362
You don't want me
looking your way.

310
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,264
Why am I here?

311
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,963
To help me plan the defense
of King's Landing.

312
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:51,703
Stannis will be here
any day.

313
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,642
And one of these
explains how to beat him?

314
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:01,847
"An History of the Great
Sieges of Westeros"

315
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,850
by Archmaester
"Shevelathin."

316
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,852
"Shevelatesh."

317
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:09,021
"Chevalteesh."

318
00:20:11,758 --> 00:20:14,594
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

319
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:16,963
My Lord Hand,
Commander.

320
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:18,464
I must compliment you

321
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:21,734
on the Gold Cloaks' performance
these last few weeks.

322
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:25,772
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

323
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:29,609
I did not know.

324
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:32,913
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

325
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,382
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

326
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,018
For questioning?

327
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:40,654
<i>Uh, no.</i>

328
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:42,989
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

329
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,059
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

330
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,095
Have you ever been
in a city under siege?

331
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,564
Maybe this part's
not in your books.

332
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,000
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people.

333
00:20:54,034 --> 00:20:57,237
It's the starving.
Food's worth more than gold.

334
00:20:57,271 --> 00:21:00,874
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

335
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,775
Things get bad enough,

336
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,644
the poor start
eating each other.

337
00:21:04,678 --> 00:21:07,580
<i>The thieves,</i>
<i>they love a siege.</i>

338
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:10,717
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

339
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,754
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

340
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,158
Given the circumstances,
My Lord,

341
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,695
I believe extreme measures
are warranted.

342
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,597
Ah.

343
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,633
"The Great Sieges
of Westeros."

344
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,701
Thrilling subject.

345
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:32,505
Shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

346
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,478
Stannis knows
King's Landing.

347
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:42,114
He knows where the walls
are strongest

348
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:45,884
and he knows which gates
are weakest.

349
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:50,355
The mud gate.

350
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:53,359
A good ram will batter it
down in minutes

351
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:56,094
<i>and it's only 50 yards</i>
<i>from the water.</i>

352
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:57,663
That's where he'll land.

353
00:21:57,697 --> 00:22:00,566
And if Stannis does
attack the mud gate,

354
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,868
what is our plan?

355
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:04,903
We could throw
books at his men.

356
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,472
We don't have
that many books.

357
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,340
We don't have
that many men, either.

358
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,543
What do we have?

359
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:14,679
Pig shit.

360
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:34,831
I'm not cut out
for this sort of work.

361
00:22:34,866 --> 00:22:38,334
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

362
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:41,170
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

363
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,840
I can't imagine
anything much worse.

364
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:47,443
<i>You lack imagination.</i>

365
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,914
<i>Where do you think</i>
<i>Jon is right now?</i>

366
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:53,884
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

367
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,153
A betting man
would go with dead.

368
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:58,990
He's not dead.

369
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:01,192
No, Jon's a great
fighter.

370
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:03,161
Well, he's better
than me

371
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,164
and a lot better
than you.

372
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:08,100
He's got a Valyrian
steel sword.

373
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:10,035
So did his father.

374
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:12,838
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

375
00:23:12,872 --> 00:23:15,573
Great rangers never
get old is the problem.

376
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:18,176
Shit ones neither.

377
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:21,313
It's them in the middle
that last a long time.

378
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:29,186
What in seven hells
is that?

379
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:46,969
The First Men
made these marks.

380
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:49,638
Help me with it.

381
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:03,552
Look.

382
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,125
If you find something
you're not supposed to,

383
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,229
best thing to do is pretend
you've never seen it.

384
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:14,964
That's a Night's
Watch cloak.

385
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,501
It's been here
a long time.

386
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:25,442
Oh, must be Dragonglass.

387
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:27,510
<i>Dragonglass?</i>

388
00:24:27,545 --> 00:24:30,380
The Maesters
call it Obsidian.

389
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:33,315
Why would a brother
hide it here?

390
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,885
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

391
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:43,992
Mind where you're going.

392
00:24:53,204 --> 00:24:55,539
I'm sorry.
I'll--

393
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:59,343
- where were you?
- A man has patrol duty.

394
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,979
Tywin Lannister
was right here

395
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,314
and now he's gone.

396
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:04,149
A girl owes
one more name.

397
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:06,550
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

398
00:25:07,852 --> 00:25:09,553
How long after
I give you the name

399
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:11,588
does it take you
to kill someone?

400
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:15,257
A minute, an hour,
a month.

401
00:25:16,426 --> 00:25:20,596
Death is certain,
the time is not.

402
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,764
He's taking his army
to attack my brother.

403
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:25,700
I need him dead
right now.

404
00:25:25,735 --> 00:25:28,003
This a man
cannot do.

405
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:30,506
You promised
you'd help me.

406
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,541
Help was not promised,
lovely girl.

407
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:35,378
Only death.
There must be others.

408
00:25:35,412 --> 00:25:37,747
Give a name,
any name.

409
00:25:37,782 --> 00:25:39,883
And you'll kill them?

410
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,852
Anybody?

411
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:47,891
By the seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

412
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,793
I swear it.

413
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:54,464
All right.

414
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,369
Jaqen H'ghar.

415
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:09,811
A girl gives a man
his own name?

416
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:12,480
- That's right.
- <i>Gods are not mocked.</i>

417
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:15,050
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

418
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:16,651
A man can go kill himself.

419
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:18,686
- Un-name me.
- No.

420
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:20,855
Please?

421
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:24,692
I'll un-name you.

422
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:25,725
Thank you.

423
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,479
If you help me
and my friends escape.

424
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,099
<i>This would require</i>
<i>more than one life.</i>

425
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,336
- <i>This is not part of our bargain.</i>
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

426
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,472
A girl lacks honor.

427
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:47,316
If I do this thing,
a girl must obey.

428
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:49,419
A girl will obey.

429
00:26:51,021 --> 00:26:54,323
A girl and her friends will walk
through the gate at midnight.

430
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:01,562
Thank you, Podrick.

431
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,838
Odd little boy.

432
00:27:09,872 --> 00:27:12,073
I have a certain sympathy
for odd little boys.

433
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,676
You and Varys both.

434
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:18,547
Excellent lamprey pie.

435
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:21,283
Were you slaving away
in the kitchen all day?

436
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:24,053
I hear Joffrey
plans on fighting.

437
00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:26,556
An inspiration
for the troops.

438
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,225
The young king
in his shining armor

439
00:27:28,259 --> 00:27:31,060
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

440
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:32,896
He's only a boy.

441
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,465
Younger boys are off
fighting his war.

442
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,301
He's not ready.

443
00:27:37,335 --> 00:27:39,570
What is he, 17?

444
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:42,406
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

445
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:45,243
Some men have a gift
for this sort of thing,

446
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:47,145
some don't.

447
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,046
His place is not
on the battlefield.

448
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,315
It's not on
the throne, either,

449
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,783
sadly for all of us.

450
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:59,022
Do you think
I'm an idiot?

451
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:00,857
No, I'd say you possess
above average intelligence.

452
00:28:00,892 --> 00:28:03,026
You shipped off
my only daughter.

453
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,362
And now you want to send my
eldest son to the battlefield to die.

454
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:08,565
He'll have his Kingsguard
protecting him.

455
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,534
He has the finest armor
gold can buy.

456
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:13,436
He needs to be out there.

457
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,551
The men will fight more
fiercely seeing their king

458
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:16,506
fighting beside them

459
00:28:16,507 --> 00:28:20,177
instead of hiding behind
his mother's skirts.

460
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:22,646
Any dessert?

461
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,583
Do you know why
Varys is so dangerous?

462
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:28,653
Because he has thousands
of spies in his employ.

463
00:28:28,687 --> 00:28:31,990
Because he knows everything
we do before we do it.

464
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,592
Because he doesn't
have a cock.

465
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:36,061
Neither do you.

466
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:39,865
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

467
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:41,700
You, on the other hand,

468
00:28:41,735 --> 00:28:44,203
are as big a fool
as every other man.

469
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:46,572
That little worm
between your legs

470
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,107
does half your thinking.

471
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:51,009
It's not that little.

472
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,049
Why are you smiling?

473
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,618
Because I'm happy.

474
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:02,386
And why are you happy?

475
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:09,094
Because I have
your little whore.

476
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:14,300
I thought you
preferred blondes.

477
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:15,701
Such a droll little fellow.

478
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:17,570
Tell me, have you
married this one yet?

479
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:19,839
No?

480
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:22,810
Oh, good.
Father will be so pleased.

481
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,479
Why do you care
who I fuck?

482
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:27,181
Because a Lannister
always pays her debts.

483
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,816
You stole my only daughter,

484
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,451
you plot to have
Joffrey killed.

485
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:33,388
This is madness.
Stannis will be here in days.

486
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:34,989
- You need me.
- For what?

487
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:37,125
Your skill in battle?

488
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:41,095
Pretty thing, your whore.

489
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,631
Lovely body.

490
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,234
The bruises
will heal in time.

491
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,337
Where did you find her?

492
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,607
Varys isn't the only one
who hears whispers.

493
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:55,110
Really, a Lannister
lion necklace?

494
00:29:55,145 --> 00:29:58,247
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

495
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:01,117
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

496
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:02,986
Oh?

497
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,621
Well, you're the expert.

498
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:06,823
Tell me.

499
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:10,326
You don't buy them;
You only rent them.

500
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:14,897
You're usually a better liar,
baby brother.

501
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,865
This one you like.

502
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:20,402
You like her very much.

503
00:30:20,436 --> 00:30:22,504
Could it be love?

504
00:30:22,538 --> 00:30:26,141
Don't worry, she'll be treated
gently enough...

505
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:27,876
unless Joffrey is hurt.

506
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,480
And then every wound
he suffers she'll suffer, too.

507
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,883
And if he dies,

508
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,884
there isn't a man alive
who could devise

509
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,088
a more painful death
for your little cunt.

510
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:45,362
And how do I know you
haven't killed her already?

511
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,897
Would you like to see her?

512
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,532
I thought you might.

513
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:51,302
Ser Mandon, bring in
my brother's whore.

514
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:25,836
I'm sorry they hurt you.

515
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:29,740
You must be brave.

516
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:37,013
I promise
I will free you.

517
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,148
Don't forget me.

518
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:42,484
Never.

519
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:02,973
I will hurt you
for this.

520
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:06,611
A day will come when you
think you're safe and happy

521
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:10,748
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth.

522
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:13,451
And you will know
the debt is paid.

523
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:16,621
Get out.

524
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:30,100
Shae!

525
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:34,804
I've been waiting
all night.

526
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,539
What is wrong?

527
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:38,708
You're beautiful.

528
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:49,052
Then why do you look sad?

529
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:57,394
We have to be
more careful.

530
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:00,464
Don't be afraid.
I can take care of myself.

531
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:03,567
There are people
who want to hurt me.

532
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:06,070
I know.
I won't let them.

533
00:33:06,104 --> 00:33:09,273
I'll cut off their faces.
I will.

534
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:17,214
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?

535
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:20,984
I expect I'll have to
before this is over.

536
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:25,289
You're mine.

537
00:33:26,658 --> 00:33:28,459
I'm yours.

538
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,828
Promise me.

539
00:33:34,499 --> 00:33:38,002
I'm yours,
and you are mine.

540
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:51,048
<i>Still no word?</i>

541
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:53,650
We've sent
a dozen ravens.

542
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:56,119
None have returned.

543
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:59,522
My bastard is only
a few days from Winterfell.

544
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:01,557
- Once he captures the castle--
- Theon has my brothers.

545
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:05,961
- If we storm the castle--
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

546
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:09,898
They're his only hope of escaping
the North with his head.

547
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:13,970
Send word to your son.

548
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:17,040
Any Ironborn who surrender

549
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:20,310
will be allowed to return
safely to their homes.

550
00:34:20,345 --> 00:34:23,614
A touch of mercy is a virtue,
Your Grace. Too much--

551
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:27,317
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

552
00:34:27,352 --> 00:34:30,553
He betrayed our cause.

553
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:32,856
He betrayed me.

554
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,826
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

555
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,277
I expect his countrymen
will turn on him the minute

556
00:34:38,302 --> 00:34:39,507
they hear the offer.

557
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,201
Your pardon, My Lord.
Your Grace.

558
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:47,170
My Lady.

559
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,547
How are you?

560
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:03,217
How am I?

561
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:05,485
I've had to arrest
my mother.

562
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,922
The Lannisters
have my sisters.

563
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:09,857
The man I considered
my closest friend

564
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:12,727
has seized my home
and my brothers.

565
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:15,863
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

566
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,365
I'm sorry.
It was a stupid question.

567
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,668
- I'm sorry.
- No.

568
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,937
Forgive me.

569
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:25,272
You're being kind.
I have no right.

570
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:27,341
You have every right.

571
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,743
You're a king.

572
00:35:28,777 --> 00:35:31,245
That's not the kind
of king I want to be.

573
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,548
What kind do you
want to be?

574
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:36,284
I don't know.
The good kind.

575
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:41,790
Most kings grew up
as princes.

576
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:44,993
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

577
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:48,029
I was raised to be
Lord of Winterfell.

578
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,233
I was raised to be
a proper little lady,

579
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:55,336
to play the harp
and dance the latest steps

580
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,405
and recite
Valyrian poetry.

581
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,040
I'd like to hear you
play the harp.

582
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,209
No.
No, you would not.

583
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:10,084
How did you go from
reciting Valyrian poetry

584
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,319
to sawing off
men's feet?

585
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:24,430
When I was 12,

586
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:27,066
my mother and father
went to a wedding.

587
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,369
Weddings in Volantis
last for days, you know.

588
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:32,639
And they left me
with my little brother.

589
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:36,243
The second afternoon
they were gone

590
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,313
was the hottest day
in the three-year summer.

591
00:36:39,347 --> 00:36:42,884
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

592
00:36:42,918 --> 00:36:46,521
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

593
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:50,591
<i>The rich, the poor,</i>
<i>we were all there,</i>

594
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,794
naked, screaming, racing
to the little islands.

595
00:36:53,828 --> 00:36:56,664
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

596
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,304
I was treading water,

597
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,639
talking to a friend

598
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:08,141
when I realized
I hadn't seen my brother.

599
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:12,479
I called his name.

600
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:15,182
Then I started
screaming his name.

601
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,852
And then I saw him

602
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:21,987
floating facedown.

603
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:26,425
My heart just...
stopped.

604
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,560
I was...

605
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:34,499
I dragged him
from the water.

606
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:37,069
My friend helped me,
I think.

607
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:39,171
I don't even remember.

608
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:43,709
He was so little.

609
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:47,412
Then we pulled him
onto the riverbank...

610
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:51,583
and I screamed at him

611
00:37:51,618 --> 00:37:54,086
and I shook him

612
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,422
and he was dead.

613
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,324
Just dead.

614
00:38:03,062 --> 00:38:05,397
A man ran over.

615
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:10,369
He had a fish
tattoo on his face.

616
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:14,040
In Volantis the slaves
have tattoos

617
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:17,410
so you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

618
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:20,146
And this man worked
on a fishing boat.

619
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,516
And he pushed me
out of the way.

620
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,518
You have to understand,

621
00:38:25,552 --> 00:38:28,721
for a slave to push
a highborn girl--

622
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:32,591
that's death for the man,
a terrible death.

623
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:36,528
But he pushed me
out of the way

624
00:38:36,562 --> 00:38:40,731
and he started pressing
on my brother's chest

625
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:45,302
again and again
and again

626
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:48,573
until my brother
spat out

627
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:51,109
half of the Rhoyne

628
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:52,544
and cried out.

629
00:38:52,578 --> 00:38:55,947
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

630
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:05,124
I decided
two things that day.

631
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:06,859
I would not
waste my years

632
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:11,064
planning dances and masquerades
with the other noble ladies.

633
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,534
And when
I came of age...

634
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:18,271
I would never live
in a slave city again.

635
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:27,246
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

636
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,516
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

637
00:39:30,551 --> 00:39:32,952
I don't want to marry
the Frey girl.

638
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:38,626
I don't want you
to marry her.

639
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:44,565
But you needed
that bridge.

640
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:49,537
I hope it's a very
beautiful bridge.

641
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:57,639
<i>The sour cherries was all</i>
<i>crushed up and ready.</i>

642
00:40:57,673 --> 00:40:58,848
<i>Shut up.</i>

643
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,498
<i>Probably in the piecrust</i>
<i>by now.</i>

644
00:41:01,077 --> 00:41:04,379
In the oven,
the nice warm oven.

645
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:06,915
Shut up.
What did you bring?

646
00:41:06,949 --> 00:41:08,851
The cheese
could be better.

647
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:10,519
I did get some
nice sausages.

648
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:13,522
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

649
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,090
He didn't say.

650
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,558
He just said,
"walk through the gates.

651
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:18,561
<i>What about the guards?</i>

652
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:20,330
<i>He didn't say anything</i>
<i>about the guards.</i>

653
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:21,898
What, he left that bit out?

654
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:23,533
It's a pretty important part,
don't you think?

655
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:26,703
- We have to trust him.
- <i>Trust him?</i>

656
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,972
You trusted him to fight with us
and you set him free

657
00:41:29,006 --> 00:41:31,173
- and he ran.
- I want to go back to the kitchens.

658
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:34,244
Shut up.
Stay here if you're afraid.

659
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:39,282
Arry, don't.

660
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,982
Away!
Reset!

661
00:42:18,189 --> 00:42:21,725
If the wind holds, we'll reach
King's landing in a day.

662
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:23,326
Will it hold?

663
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:25,862
Can't make promises
for the wind, Your Grace.

664
00:42:27,065 --> 00:42:29,466
<i>Again, pull!</i>

665
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:34,472
I admire you, Ser Davos.

666
00:42:34,506 --> 00:42:37,776
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.

667
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,145
Some highborn fools
call you Onion Knight

668
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,814
and think
they insult you.

669
00:42:41,848 --> 00:42:44,150
So you take the onion
for your Sigil,

670
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,652
sew it on your coat,
fly the onion flag.

671
00:42:46,687 --> 00:42:48,888
My son wishes me
to change it.

672
00:42:48,922 --> 00:42:52,124
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

673
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:55,961
I understand why the older
families look down at me.

674
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:58,229
Do you?
Why?

675
00:42:58,264 --> 00:43:01,265
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

676
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,869
Well, sons of Lords don't like to
break bread with sons of crabbers.

677
00:43:04,903 --> 00:43:06,804
Our hands stink.

678
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,407
And where were those Lords
when Storm's End starved?

679
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,743
Many fought bravely
for your brother.

680
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:14,278
Many fought
for the Mad King.

681
00:43:14,312 --> 00:43:18,283
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

682
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:20,619
Some are happy
to do it to my face.

683
00:43:20,654 --> 00:43:22,889
We were forgotten.

684
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:25,558
Robert and Ned Stark--
they were the heroes,

685
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:29,295
the glorious rebels marching
from battle to battle,

686
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,931
liberating towns from
the yoke of the Mad King

687
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:34,633
while I held Storm's End
with 500 men.

688
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:36,601
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

689
00:43:36,636 --> 00:43:38,736
He gave Storm's End
to Renly after the war.

690
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:40,304
Renly never fought
a day in his life.

691
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:43,374
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

692
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:48,879
First we ate the horses.

693
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:52,250
We weren't riding anyway,
not with the castle surrounded.

694
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:54,953
We couldn't feed them,
so fine, the horses.

695
00:43:54,987 --> 00:43:56,988
Then the cats.
Never liked cats.

696
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:59,759
So fine.
I do like dogs.

697
00:43:59,793 --> 00:44:01,427
Good animals.
Loyal.

698
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:03,897
But we ate them.
Then the rats.

699
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:06,133
The night before
you slipped through,

700
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,035
I thought my wife
was dying.

701
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:10,303
She couldn't speak anymore,
she was so frail.

702
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:13,507
And then you made it
through the lines.

703
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:16,877
Slipped right through in your little
black sailboat with your onions.

704
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:19,679
And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.

705
00:44:19,714 --> 00:44:22,449
Every man in Storm's End
wanted to kiss you that night.

706
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:24,818
I was relieved
they did not.

707
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:29,990
Robert told me to hold
Storm's End, so I held it.

708
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:33,494
Then he told me
he was giving it to Renly,

709
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:34,829
so I gave it up.

710
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:37,265
Insult or no,
I gave it up

711
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,567
because Robert was my older brother
and he was the king

712
00:44:39,602 --> 00:44:41,770
and I've always
done my duty.

713
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,740
But now I'm the rightful king by
every law of Westeros.

714
00:44:45,775 --> 00:44:48,343
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

715
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,182
Your Grace...

716
00:44:55,018 --> 00:44:57,053
I pray I serve you well.

717
00:44:58,622 --> 00:45:01,290
I expect you'll be the first crabber's
son to wear the badge.

718
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,797
You're the master
of whisperers.

719
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:09,565
You're supposed
to know everything.

720
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,502
No man can be in all
rooms at all times.

721
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:15,572
I have many little birds
in the North, My Lord,

722
00:45:15,606 --> 00:45:17,407
but I haven't heard
their songs

723
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:20,142
since Theon Greyjoy
captured Winterfell.

724
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:21,778
The Stark forces
are distracted.

725
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:23,746
Now is the time
to strike.

726
00:45:23,781 --> 00:45:25,514
To strike?

727
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:27,516
My dear nephew,
you do see these men

728
00:45:27,551 --> 00:45:29,218
preparing the walls
for siege?

729
00:45:29,252 --> 00:45:32,788
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

730
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:35,223
If my Uncle Stannis lands on
the shores of King's Landing,

731
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:37,225
I'll ride out
to greet him.

732
00:45:37,259 --> 00:45:39,160
A brave choice,
Your Grace.

733
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:42,029
I'm sure your men
will line up behind you.

734
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:44,965
They say Stannis
never smiles.

735
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:47,667
I'll give him
a red smile

736
00:45:47,702 --> 00:45:49,836
from ear to ear.

737
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:57,211
Imagine Stannis's terror.

738
00:45:57,245 --> 00:45:59,313
I am trying.

739
00:46:00,482 --> 00:46:02,216
You're
an intelligent man.

740
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,951
I'd like to think
I'm an intelligent man.

741
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:05,553
Oh, no one disputes
that, My Lord,

742
00:46:05,587 --> 00:46:07,855
not even the multitudes
who despise you.

743
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,792
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

744
00:46:10,827 --> 00:46:12,661
I wish we could, too.

745
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:16,899
What do you want?

746
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:19,135
Tell me.

747
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:21,037
If we're going to play,

748
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:23,373
you'll have to start.

749
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:31,513
My brother was the youngest
Kingsguard in history.

750
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:35,350
My sister became queen
at the age of 19.

751
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:38,786
When I reached manhood,

752
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:40,647
my father put me
in charge of all the drains

753
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,533
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

754
00:46:42,891 --> 00:46:44,925
A most highborn plumber.

755
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,061
The water never
flowed better.

756
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,031
And all the shit
found its way to the sea.

757
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:52,868
I never expected
to have any real power.

758
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:55,104
So when my father
named me acting Hand--

759
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:57,240
You're quite good
at being Hand, you know?

760
00:46:57,274 --> 00:47:00,110
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark
were good men,

761
00:47:00,144 --> 00:47:02,178
honorable men,

762
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:05,049
but they disdained the game
and those who played.

763
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,618
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

764
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:10,154
Last thing I expected.

765
00:47:10,188 --> 00:47:11,655
And you play it well.

766
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:13,757
I'd like to keep
playing it.

767
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:19,196
If Stannis breaches
the gates, the game is over.

768
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,864
They say he burns
his enemies alive

769
00:47:21,899 --> 00:47:23,934
to honor
the Lord of Light.

770
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:26,302
The Lord of Light
wants his enemies burned,

771
00:47:26,337 --> 00:47:28,838
the drowned God
wants them drowned.

772
00:47:28,873 --> 00:47:30,874
Why are all the Gods
such vicious cunts?

773
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:34,445
Where is the God
of tits and wine?

774
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:36,380
In the Summer Isles,

775
00:47:36,414 --> 00:47:39,416
they worship a fertility
goddess with 16 teats.

776
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:42,119
We should sail there
immediately.

777
00:47:43,956 --> 00:47:47,325
This morning
I heard a song

778
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,861
all the way from Qarth
beyond the Red Waste.

779
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:52,863
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

780
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:57,468
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

781
00:47:57,503 --> 00:47:59,936
She has three dragons.

782
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:03,740
But even if what
they say is true,

783
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:06,709
it'll be years before
they are fully grown.

784
00:48:06,744 --> 00:48:09,412
And then there will be
nowhere to hide.

785
00:48:10,915 --> 00:48:12,816
One game at a time,
my friend.

786
00:48:22,993 --> 00:48:25,160
<i>Careful, Khaleesi.</i>

787
00:48:25,195 --> 00:48:27,576
<i>Xaro owns this city</i>
<i>and the warlocks have 1,000</i>

788
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:29,366
<i>eyes watching for you.</i>

789
00:48:29,966 --> 00:48:32,835
I found one--

790
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:35,336
a ship with
a good captain.

791
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,973
She leaves for
Astapor tomorrow.

792
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:40,175
- Astapor?
- We cannot stay here.

793
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,462
They have my dragons.

794
00:48:41,487 --> 00:48:43,395
A mother does not flee
without her children.

795
00:48:43,513 --> 00:48:45,580
They're not your children.

796
00:48:45,615 --> 00:48:48,216
I know they call you
the Mother of Dragons

797
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,019
and I know you love them, but you
didn't grow them in your womb.

798
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,621
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

799
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:56,057
And if we stay
in Qarth, we'll die.

800
00:48:56,091 --> 00:48:59,160
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

801
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,732
You know
I would die for you.

802
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:07,468
I will never
abandon you.

803
00:49:07,502 --> 00:49:09,804
I'm sworn to protect you,
to serve.

804
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:11,906
Then serve me.

805
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,237
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying,

806
00:49:14,262 --> 00:49:15,409
then take me there.

807
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,311
That's what
the warlock wants.

808
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:19,147
He told you so himself.

809
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:21,816
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

810
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,853
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

811
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:26,888
You saw me step
into the fire.

812
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:29,391
You watched the witch burn.
What did the flames do to me?

813
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,360
Do you remember?

814
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:36,633
Until my last breath
I will remember.

815
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:41,305
After I have forgotten
my mother's face.

816
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:48,246
They are my children.

817
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:52,617
And they are the only
children I will ever have.

818
00:49:58,223 --> 00:50:00,358
Take me to them.

819
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,405
We should bury them.

820
00:50:14,439 --> 00:50:16,740
I'd leave 'em up
a few more days.

821
00:50:16,775 --> 00:50:18,842
Sends a message.

822
00:50:18,877 --> 00:50:20,477
If they haven't got
the damn message yet,

823
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:22,546
a few more days
won't help.

824
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,181
As you say.

825
00:50:24,215 --> 00:50:27,150
But it don't hurt to let
'em rot a while longer.

826
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:29,086
What's this?

827
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,422
Gold for the farmer.

828
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:34,125
For his trouble.

829
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:35,527
His troubles are done.

830
00:50:35,561 --> 00:50:39,131
He's feeding
the crops now.

831
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,034
<i>His wife, too.</i>

832
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,739
You want to keep a man
silent, you silence him.

833
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,929
Got as far as the farm
and then doubled back.

834
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:13,701
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

835
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:19,006
Hoped this would be the
last place they'd think to look.

836
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:23,211
You're right...

837
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,947
so far.

838
00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:28,216
Who was that out there

839
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,851
hung up the gates?

840
00:51:30,885 --> 00:51:33,587
Must have been
the farmer's boys.

841
00:51:35,156 --> 00:51:38,525
He killed them
and burned them

842
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,161
<i>and passed them off</i>
<i>as the little lords?</i>

843
00:51:41,196 --> 00:51:42,963
Shh, shh, shh.

844
00:51:42,997 --> 00:51:45,632
<i>They mustn't know.</i>

845
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:48,368
<i>Bran would blame</i>
<i>himself.</i>

846
00:51:48,402 --> 00:51:51,971
<i>They'll never</i>
<i>hear it from me.</i>

847
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:55,041
<i>The little lads</i>
<i>have suffered enough.</i>
